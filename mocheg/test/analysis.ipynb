When it comes to agreeing on what changes to make, though, it gets tricky. U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, proposed a bill on Feb. 14, 2020 aimed at forcing health systems to lower costs: the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2020, which would require providers to publicly disclose the price of their products and services. It echoed a similar bill Gallagher cosponsored in 2019 that won bipartisan support. The new bill was referred to committee that same day and hasn't moved since, but Gallagher appeared June 25, 2020 on a Fox News program to discuss its effects if enacted. On the segment, Gallagher said health care consumers don't act as conventional consumers because they don't compare prices before purchasing. And rising costs, he claimed, have led to an unusual circumstance: 'The average family in America forks over more of their hard-earned income to their local hospital than to the IRS.' Is Gallagher correct? Hospital expenditures vs. federal taxes When asked for backup for the claim, a Gallagher spokesman pointed to a Jan. 26, 2019 Forbes opinion piece aptly titled 'In 2018, The Average Family Paid More To Hospitals Than To The Federal Government in Taxes.' The piece was written by Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a right-leaning think tank based in Austin, Texas. He breaks down the math problem he's used to examine hospital costs and payments to the IRS. He started with what Americans spend on hospital care overall: $1.2 trillion in 2018. That is on the money - according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 33% of the nation's $3.6 trillion in health spending during 2018 went to hospital care. When divided by the 327.2 million people who lived in the U.S. that year, each person accounted for about $3,667 of that sum. Using census data to determine that the average American family consisted of 2.5 persons, Roy asserted that the 'average' family's share of money spent on hospital care was just under $9,280. That's about 14.7% of the 2018 median household income, which the census bureau placed at $63,179. Comparatively, Roy says, the average family pays a lower percentage of its income in federal taxes. He points to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the federal Joint Committee on Taxation estimated would bring the average tax rate for a median-income household down from 14.8% to 13.5% for households that brought in $50,000 to $75,000 per year in 2019. A median household income would fit into that range, and -- based on the earlier math -- would pay a larger share than that in hospital costs.</td>\n",

       "1390  Americans pay a lot for health care, and the system may be the one thing in life that everyone -- regardless of political affiliation -- would like to change. When it comes to agreeing on what changes to make, though, it gets tricky. U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, proposed a bill on Feb. 14, 2020 aimed at forcing health systems to lower costs: the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2020, which would require providers to publicly disclose the price of their products and services. It echoed a similar bill Gallagher cosponsored in 2019 that won bipartisan support. The new bill was referred to committee that same day and hasn't moved since, but Gallagher appeared June 25, 2020 on a Fox News program to discuss its effects if enacted. On the segment, Gallagher said health care consumers don't act as conventional consumers because they don't compare prices before purchasing. And rising costs, he claimed, have led to an unusual circumstance: 'The average family in America forks over more of their hard-earned income to their local hospital than to the IRS.' Is Gallagher correct? Hospital expenditures vs. federal taxes When asked for backup for the claim, a Gallagher spokesman pointed to a Jan. 26, 2019 Forbes opinion piece aptly titled 'In 2018, The Average Family Paid More To Hospitals Than To The Federal Government in Taxes.' The piece was written by Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a right-leaning think tank based in Austin, Texas. He breaks down the math problem he's used to examine hospital costs and payments to the IRS. He started with what Americans spend on hospital care overall: $1.2 trillion in 2018. That is on the money - according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 33% of the nation's $3.6 trillion in health spending during 2018 went to hospital care. When divided by the 327.2 million people who lived in the U.S. that year, each person accounted for about $3,667 of that sum. Using census data to determine that the average American family consisted of 2.5 persons, Roy asserted that the 'average' family's share of money spent on hospital care was just under $9,280. That's about 14.7% of the 2018 median household income, which the census bureau placed at $63,179. Comparatively, Roy says, the average family pays a lower percentage of its income in federal taxes. He points to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the federal Joint Committee on Taxation estimated would bring the average tax rate for a median-income household down from 14.8% to 13.5% for households that brought in $50,000 to $75,000 per year in 2019. A median household income would fit into that range, and -- based on the earlier math -- would pay a larger share than that in hospital costs.   \n",

It featured a purported German children's story titled 'Little Suck-a-Thumb.' @calvinandhabs Reply to @pcampos2000 Germans are funny. #german #funny #storytime #hilarious #sketch â™¬ original sound - Calvin &amp; Habs The video began with one of the men saying: 'As Germans, we are naturally very funny.' The other chimed in with: 'We're raised with hilarious children's stories like 'Little Suck-a-Thumb.'' The pair acted out a story where a mother tells a child to not suck his thumb. She tells him if he continues to do so, a tall tailor will cut it off. The mother leaves the room. Next, the tall tailor arrives and cuts off the child's thumb. This is a tale from a real German children's book titled 'Der Struwwelpeter.' It was first published in 1845 and featured 10 stories written and illustrated by Heinrich Hoffmann. It is available for reading on the Virginia Commonwealth University website. After the mother warns the boy, the 'great tall tailor' arrives with his 'great sharp scissors': The door flew open, in he ran, The great, long, red-legged scissorman. Oh! children, see! the tailor's come And caught our little Suck-a-Thumb. Snip! Snap! Snip! the scissors go; And Conrad cries out - Oh! Oh! Oh! Snip! Snap! Snip! They go so fast; That both his thumbs are off at last. Mamma comes home; there Conrad stands, And looks quite sad, and shows his hands;- 'Ah!' said Mamma 'I knew he'd come To naughty little Suck-a-Thumb.' The book page was also reposted on Pinterest: In recent years, the strange tale has made its way into American popular culture. For example, there was this sequence from the cartoon TV series 'Family Guy.' In the clip, the mother cuts off the child's thumbs: Dwight Schrute, a character on the American version of 'The Office,' also brought up 'Little Suck-a-Thumb.' The moment appeared during Season 2, Episode 18. The episode's title was 'Take Your Daughter to Work Day.' Schrute's character changed the tale for the little girls present in the room: Dover Publications included a brief history of the book after it republished the tales in 1995: First published in 1845, 'Struwwelpeter' (variously translated as 'slovenly' or 'shock-headed' Peter) has become widely recognized as one of the most popular and influential children's books ever written. Heinrich Hoffman was a Frankfurt physician. Unhappy with the dry and pedagogic books available for children at the time, he wrote and illustrated 'Struwwelpeter' as a Christmas present for his three-year-old son. The book relates in verse and pictures the often gruesome consequences that befall children who torment animals, play with matches, suck their thumbs, refuse to eat, fidget at meals, etc. Written in rhyming couplets and illustrated by the author, the book was an immediate success. It has since gone through hundreds of editions and been published in almost every European language. In sum, 'Little Suck-a-Thumb' was indeed a story that appeared in a real German children's book.</td>\n",

It featured a purported German children's story titled 'Little Suck-a-Thumb.' @calvinandhabs Reply to @pcampos2000 Germans are funny. #german #funny #storytime #hilarious #sketch â™¬ original sound - Calvin & Habs The video began with one of the men saying: 'As Germans, we are naturally very funny.' The other chimed in with: 'We're raised with hilarious children's stories like 'Little Suck-a-Thumb.'' The pair acted out a story where a mother tells a child to not suck his thumb. She tells him if he continues to do so, a tall tailor will cut it off. The mother leaves the room. Next, the tall tailor arrives and cuts off the child's thumb. This is a tale from a real German children's book titled 'Der Struwwelpeter.' It was first published in 1845 and featured 10 stories written and illustrated by Heinrich Hoffmann. It is available for reading on the Virginia Commonwealth University website. After the mother warns the boy, the 'great tall tailor' arrives with his 'great sharp scissors': The door flew open, in he ran, The great, long, red-legged scissorman. Oh! children, see! the tailor's come And caught our little Suck-a-Thumb. Snip! Snap! Snip! the scissors go; And Conrad cries out - Oh! Oh! Oh! Snip! Snap! Snip! They go so fast; That both his thumbs are off at last. Mamma comes home; there Conrad stands, And looks quite sad, and shows his hands;- 'Ah!' said Mamma 'I knew he'd come To naughty little Suck-a-Thumb.' The book page was also reposted on Pinterest: In recent years, the strange tale has made its way into American popular culture. For example, there was this sequence from the cartoon TV series 'Family Guy.' In the clip, the mother cuts off the child's thumbs: Dwight Schrute, a character on the American version of 'The Office,' also brought up 'Little Suck-a-Thumb.' The moment appeared during Season 2, Episode 18. The episode's title was 'Take Your Daughter to Work Day.' Schrute's character changed the tale for the little girls present in the room: Dover Publications included a brief history of the book after it republished the tales in 1995: First published in 1845, 'Struwwelpeter' (variously translated as 'slovenly' or 'shock-headed' Peter) has become widely recognized as one of the most popular and influential children's books ever written. Heinrich Hoffman was a Frankfurt physician. Unhappy with the dry and pedagogic books available for children at the time, he wrote and illustrated 'Struwwelpeter' as a Christmas present for his three-year-old son. The book relates in verse and pictures the often gruesome consequences that befall children who torment animals, play with matches, suck their thumbs, refuse to eat, fidget at meals, etc. Written in rhyming couplets and illustrated by the author, the book was an immediate success. It has since gone through hundreds of editions and been published in almost every European language. In sum, 'Little Suck-a-Thumb' was indeed a story that appeared in a real German children's book.   \n",
