## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) mentions that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022, and that President Trump froze military aid in early March 2025, lifting the freeze shortly after. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg).

The CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine, including weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg). The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided significantly less than $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. NPR states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The CSIS article from February 11, 2025, discusses the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries, including weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the U.S. has provided significantly less than $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. Multiple sources indicate that the total military assistance is around $75 billion since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The claim is therefore not factually accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine by February 2025 is false. Evidence from sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war) indicates that the U.S. has provided approximately $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. Additionally, a [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) article from February 2025 discusses the Trump administration's boost to military aid, including weapons sales, which is significantly less than the claimed amount.
