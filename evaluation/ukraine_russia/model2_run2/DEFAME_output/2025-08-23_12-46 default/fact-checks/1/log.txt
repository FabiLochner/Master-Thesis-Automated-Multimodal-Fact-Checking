Useful result: From [Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-zelenskyy-didnt-buy-villa-on-island-of-billionaires/): 
Content: The article, published on February 27, 2025, by Yana Sliemzina, debunks a claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthelemy island. The article states that the document presented as evidence is fake and that the real estate company Sibarth Real Estate confirmed the villa was sold in October 2024 to a French company. <image:1552>, <image:1553>, <image:1554>. The article also mentions that the claim was spread by Russian media.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest, or Kehlsteinhaus, in Berchtesgaden in the southern German state of Bavaria, for 14.2 million euros.' is false.
Justification: The claim is disputed. While one source, AOL, states the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, contradicting the claim, another source, EADaily, supports it. Given the conflicting information and the potential for fabricated evidence, the claim is considered false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
