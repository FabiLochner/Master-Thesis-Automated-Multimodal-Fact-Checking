### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources discuss committee assignments but do not mention any blocking or reasons for assignment decisions. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Thune blocked Schiff's assignments and the reasons behind such actions.
