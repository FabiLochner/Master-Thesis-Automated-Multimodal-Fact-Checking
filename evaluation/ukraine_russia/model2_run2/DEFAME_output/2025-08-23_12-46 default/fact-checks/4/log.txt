Useful result: From [Source](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military): 
Content: The search result discusses a claim made by Dutch journalist Sonja van den Ende that a Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers in Odesa. <image:1595> The claim has been debunked by the Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk, who stated that the journalist provided no evidence for her claims. The journalist has been spreading narratives sympathetic to Russia since 2015.

Useful result: From [Source](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/russian-aircraft-allegedly-destroyed-a-british-special-forces-group-in-odesa): 
Content: The search result discusses a claim that Russian aircraft destroyed a group of British SAS special forces in Odesa. The press service of the Tavria Operational grouping of troops and the speaker of the Ukrainian Navy denied the information. The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council also drew attention to this.

Useful result: From [Source](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2025/08/04/these-are-not-tourists-two-british-colonels-were-captured-by-russian-special-forces): 
Content: The search result from EADaily.com, published on August 4, 2025, reports that Russian special forces captured two British officers, Colonels Edward Blake and Richard Carroll, during a special operation in Ukraine. The article references a Norwegian publication, Steigan, which claims that London has been fighting against Russia for a long time. The article also mentions that the UK was surprised by the event.

The claim '<image:3> This image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces who were killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: Claims of British Special Forces casualties in the Odessa region have been debunked by Ukrainian military sources, including a claim by Dutch journalist Sonja van den Ende. While the image shows coffins draped with the Union Jack, there is no evidence to verify the image's context or the claim that it depicts the coffins of British Special Forces killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region.

So, the overall veracity is: false
