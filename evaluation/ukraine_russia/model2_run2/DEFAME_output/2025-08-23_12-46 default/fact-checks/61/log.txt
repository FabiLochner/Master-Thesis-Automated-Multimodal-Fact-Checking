Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While reports from sources like *The Economic Times* ([https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms)) and *The Kyiv Post* ([https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868)) confirm an explosion involving one of Putin's limousines, they do not mention Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.
