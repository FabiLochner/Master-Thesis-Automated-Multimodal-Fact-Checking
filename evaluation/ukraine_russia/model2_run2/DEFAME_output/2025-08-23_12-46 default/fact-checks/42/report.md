The Associated Press published an interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, in Kyiv. Zelenskyy stated that excluding Ukraine from talks between the U.S. and Russia about the war would be "very dangerous."

U.S. News & World Report also published an article summarizing the AP interview with Zelenskyy, discussing his statements on talks between Moscow and Washington, the role of NATO, and skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine or whether Zelenskyy made any statements about it. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In an interview with the Associated Press on February 1, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine had received a portion of the U.S. aid. According to an article published by Izvestia ([https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine)), Zelenskyy said Kyiv received over $75 billion from Washington, and aid for $177 billion "not in money, but in weapons." Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked)) reported that Zelenskyy said Ukraine's military received only a portion of the billions in US aid, citing a total of $177bn or $200bn spent by the US, with Ukraine not receiving about $100bn of that total. Pravda.com.ua ([https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)) reported that Zelenskyy said Ukraine received about US$76 billion of the approximately US$177 billion in aid approved by the U.S. ![image 3374](media/2025-08-22_22-09-1755900578-609336.jpg), <image:k>, ![image 3378](media/2025-08-22_22-09-1755900582-506159.jpg)


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview on February 1, 2025, that Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid. Multiple sources, including Izvestia, Al Jazeera, and Pravda.com.ua, report on Zelenskyy's statements regarding the aid. The amounts mentioned vary slightly across sources, with figures around $75-76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion in aid. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms that Ukraine received a portion of the aid.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/where-missing-100-billion-us-aid-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/where-missing-100-billion-us-aid-ukraine)) discusses the controversy surrounding U.S. aid to Ukraine, mentioning Zelenskyy's statement that Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in aid, leading to questions about the "missing" funds. DW ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-trumps-attacks-on-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-aid/a-71702392](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-trumps-attacks-on-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-aid/a-71702392)) fact-checks claims about Zelenskyy and U.S. aid, noting that a significant portion of the aid is used to pay U.S. soldiers training Ukrainian troops and for weapons and equipment. Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/false-russian-allegations-that-ukraine-stole-100-billion-of-us-funds/7967072.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/false-russian-allegations-that-ukraine-stole-100-billion-of-us-funds/7967072.html)) debunks Russian allegations of Ukraine stealing U.S. funds, citing Zelenskyy's statement about receiving $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S. ![image 2135](media/2025-08-07_19-53-1754596388-246828.jpg), ![image 2137](media/2025-08-07_19-53-1754596400-258067.jpg)


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid, with various sources citing figures around $76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion. The evidence also shows that a portion of the aid is used for purposes other than direct financial transfers to Ukraine, such as paying U.S. soldiers and for weapons and equipment. However, the evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation.



## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy stated Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid, with varying figures cited by different sources. However, the evidence does not support the claim that this statement confirms the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
In a February 1, 2025, AP interview, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid, with sources citing around $76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion. While this statement is confirmed by multiple sources, including [Izvestia](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked), and [Pravda.com.ua](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/), the evidence does not support the claim that this confirms the aid is a money laundering operation.
