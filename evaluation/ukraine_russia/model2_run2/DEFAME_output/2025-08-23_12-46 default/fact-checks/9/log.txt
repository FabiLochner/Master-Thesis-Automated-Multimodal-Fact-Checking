Useful result: From [Source](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/03/13/rusia-retomo-sudzha-la-ciudad-mas-grande-de-kursk-en-la-frontera-con-ucrania/): 
Content: The search result from Infobae discusses the recapture of Sudzha, a city in the Kursk region, by Russian forces. The article mentions that the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the recapture of Sudzha from Ukrainian forces in March 2025. The article also mentions that the city was almost destroyed by bombings. <image:4618>. The article also includes an image of Volodymyr Zelensky during a press conference.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Volodymyr Zelensky visiting troops in the Kharkiv region in May 2022, as reported by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)) and Telegrafi.com. The claim incorrectly places the image in the Kursk region in August 2024, despite evidence suggesting Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
