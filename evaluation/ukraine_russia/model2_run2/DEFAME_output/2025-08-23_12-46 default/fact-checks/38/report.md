## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race. This accusation was made during an Oval Office meeting and was linked to Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. NBC News also reported on this visit, with some Republicans viewing it as a signal of Zelenskyy's preference in the election. ABC News reported on a meeting between Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It only mentions that some Republicans viewed his actions as a signal of support.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania or his meetings with Harris were explicitly aimed at supporting Harris's campaign.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that House Oversight Chair James Comer opened an investigation into Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on September 22, 2024, claiming it was a campaign event for Kamala Harris. However, the evidence does not provide details about the nature of the visit or any explicit campaigning by Zelenskyy.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024 is not fully supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory in Pennsylvania, and some Republicans viewed this as a signal of support for Harris, there is no direct evidence of Zelenskyy explicitly campaigning for Harris. Furthermore, an investigation was opened into the visit, but the nature of the visit and any explicit campaigning by Zelenskyy is not detailed. Therefore, the claim is not definitively proven. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not definitively supported. While Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania, and some Republicans viewed this as a signal of support for Kamala Harris, there is no direct evidence of Zelenskyy explicitly campaigning for Harris. Furthermore, an investigation was opened into the visit, but the nature of the visit and any explicit campaigning by Zelenskyy is not detailed.
