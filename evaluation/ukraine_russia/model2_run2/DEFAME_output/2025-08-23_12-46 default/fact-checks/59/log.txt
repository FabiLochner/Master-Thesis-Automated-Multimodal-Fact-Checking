The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Neither the web search nor the image search results provide any evidence of a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes taken by US politicians. The search results mention corruption concerns and investigations related to Ukraine, but they do not support the specific claim made in the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
