Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia): 
Content: The CNN article, published on June 29, 2025, reports that a Ukrainian F-16 pilot was killed after Russia launched a large aerial assault. The article states that this was the fourth F-16 lost by Ukraine since they began flying the jets. <image:k> shows an explosion in the sky during a Russian drone attack.

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, as reported by The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), not a Russian attack. While Ukraine has lost F-16s in the conflict with Russia, the image is unrelated to the current conflict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
