## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reports that the State Department approved $322 million in weapons sales to Ukraine, including supplies, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles and surface-to-air missile systems. (<image:0>) The CSIS analysis discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including the announcements and deliveries of weapons.

The search result from forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States. The aid includes various armaments, ammunition, and equipment. The United States has provided small arms and ammunition seized from Iranian forces. The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News reports that Ukraine's security service uncovered corruption in an arms purchase worth about $40 million. (![image 4880](media/2025-08-23_13-06-1755954415-104820.jpg), ![image 4881](media/2025-08-23_13-06-1755954415-183076.jpg)) PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, mentioning that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998, in part through theft and discount arms sales. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reports that Bulgarian authorities searched arms dealers' homes and offices as part of a corruption investigation launched by Ukraine, probing alleged overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published an article discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, noting that criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains. (![image 1112](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505188-439338.jpg)) The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched the Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking to counteract illegal arms trafficking and ensure information exchange between Ukrainian authorities and partner countries.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has faced corruption issues in arms purchases and is actively working to combat illicit arms trafficking. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not provide any specific data on the volume of arms sales or the origin of the armaments being sold.

**Insufficient Information**.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine's weapons sales decreased to 34 SIPRI TIV Million in 2023 from 72 SIPRI TIV Million in 2022, according to tradingeconomics.com, which sources its data from SIPRI. Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19, with the USA supplying 45% of the major arms. The World Bank also provides data on arms exports from Ukraine, sourced from SIPRI. (<image:0>)

## Elaboration
The evidence shows that Ukraine's weapons sales decreased in 2023. Ukraine is the world's largest importer of major arms, with imports increasing significantly, and the USA is the main supplier. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

**Insufficient Information**.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that Ukraine is the world's largest importer of arms, with the United States being a major supplier. While there is evidence of corruption and arms trafficking concerns, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The available data focuses on imports and exports, not on the specific percentage of arms sales from the US aid.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While Ukraine's arms sales decreased in 2023, and it is the world's largest importer of arms, with the U.S. as a major supplier, there is no data to confirm that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The provided sources, including [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales) and [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian), focus on import/export statistics and do not provide the specific information needed to verify the claim.
