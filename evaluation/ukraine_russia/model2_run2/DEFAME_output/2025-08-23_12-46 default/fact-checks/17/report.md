### Evidence from `web_search`
The Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/that-volodymyr-zelenskyy/](https://mythdetector.com/en/that-volodymyr-zelenskyy/)) fact-checked the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel, France, and found it to be false. The information originated from anonymous Russian-language accounts and was reported by a questionable French-language media outlet. The hotel was purchased in 2023 by the Monegasque company Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) (![image 1861](media/2025-08-07_19-11-1754593914-756508.jpg), ![image 1862](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593941-308493.jpg)).

The hotel was actually purchased by the Monegasque company Société des Bains de Mer (SBM).
