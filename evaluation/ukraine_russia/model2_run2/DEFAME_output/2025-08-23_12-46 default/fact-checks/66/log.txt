Useful result: From [Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War): 
Content: The Britannica article discusses the Russo-Japanese War (1904â€“05), a military conflict in which Japan defeated Russia. The war was caused by the rivalry between Russia and Japan for dominance in Korea and Manchuria. The article mentions that Japan forced Russia to abandon its expansionist policy in East Asia. <image:2464>, <image:2459>. The article also mentions the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which Japan gained control of the Kwantung Peninsula.

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The search results reveal historical conflicts between Russia, Japan, and China, such as the [Russo-Japanese War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War) and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, but they do not provide any evidence to support the claim that China and Japan are currently planning to invade Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
