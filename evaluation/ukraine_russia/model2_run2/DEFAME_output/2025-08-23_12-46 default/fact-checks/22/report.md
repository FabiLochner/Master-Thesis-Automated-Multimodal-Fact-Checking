## Elaboration

The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/dutch-german-intelligence-report-russian-chemical-weapons-use-in-ukraine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/dutch-german-intelligence-report-russian-chemical-weapons-use-in-ukraine)) mentions Russia's use of chemical weapons, while the BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-70669684](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-70669684)) discusses claims about Ukraine's alleged use of chemical weapons.

To verify the claim, information about the image's origin, the specific chemical agent used, and the location and date of the event is needed.

### Evidence from `web_search`

Reuters could not independently verify the claim. The article includes an image ![image 1908](media/2025-08-07_19-20-1754594438-883912.jpg).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Russia accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons in the Kursk region in August 2024. However, Reuters could not independently verify this claim. The provided image search results do not provide any information about the image in the claim.

The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of evidence. The evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there are accusations of chemical weapons use in the region, the specific claim about the image depicting a Ukrainian chemical attack during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 cannot be verified. The evidence includes reports of Russia accusing Ukraine of war crimes, including chemical weapons use, but these claims are not independently verified. The image search results do not provide any information about the image in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of accusations of chemical weapons use in the region, including claims by Russia against Ukraine, these claims are not independently verified, and the image's origin and context remain unconfirmed. The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sbu-says-russia-trying-falsely-accuse-kyiv-war-crimes-2024-08-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sbu-says-russia-trying-falsely-accuse-kyiv-war-crimes-2024-08-12/)) mentions the accusations, but the claim cannot be verified.
