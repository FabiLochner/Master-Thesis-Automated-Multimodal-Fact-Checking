Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, on September 17-18, 2024. The attack, attributed to Ukraine's Security Service, caused a series of explosions and fires. The depot contained fuel tanks, missiles, explosive warehouses, S300 missiles, Iskander and Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs, North Korean Hwasong-11A (KN-23) missiles, artillery ammunition, and North Korean munitions. The CIA provided intelligence about the depot. The attack resulted in a large crater and a seismic wave.

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e): 
Content: The Associated Press reports that Ukrainian drones struck a major military depot in Toropets, Russia, northwest of Moscow. The depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. The article includes satellite images of the depot before and after the strike. <image:23> is one of the images. The images are from Maxar Technologies.

The claim '<image:23> This image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after it was hit by a, possible nuclear, strike from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).' is false.
Justification: The images depict a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after an attack. However, the attack was carried out by Ukrainian drones, not NATO, and there is no evidence of a nuclear strike, as confirmed by the Associated Press article.

So, the overall veracity is: false
