This [front cover](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 on X (formerly Twitter) with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, purportedly published by _The Economist,_ is ALTERED.

The post accompanying the magazine cover reads, “APOCALYPSE: Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the start of World War III,” warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.”

The same claim has been posted [here](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 and [here](https://archive.is/x6qkC)
.

However, did _The Economist_ publish the front cover? PesaCheck investigated.

_The Economist_ [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 shows no November 2024 covers similar to the one under investigation.

In November, the outlet published two front pages featuring Donald Trump, but none had a photo of Russian President Putin or the headline “Apocalypse.”

Zoom image will be displayed

The alleged front cover circulating online has stories similar to those in [an edition published](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-16)
 by _The Economist._ However, it was altered to include photos of Trump and Putin.

The [original front cover](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Di8B4QNPs/)
 has stories from _The Economist’s_ 16 March 2024 edition.

_The altered cover (left) vs the original cover_

Additionally, the fake cover does not display a publication date, whereas authentic covers always indicate when the issue was released, as shown on the [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
.

PesaCheck has looked into this front cover on X with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin purportedly published by _The Economist_ and finds that it was ALTERED.

Hijacked news stories appear in different forms, from basic images to complete websites or social media profiles

Advertisement

Shortly after [Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 won his second term as US president last November, an image of the front cover of _The Economist_ magazine was [shared online](https://archive.ph/nZAM2 "External link — shared online")
 with captions in several languages.

The banner headline read "Apocalypse," and was accompanied by an image of Trump facing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](/en/vladimir-putin/t-17449200)
 with a series of long-range missiles in the background.

Some of the comments linked to the cover feared the start of World War III and speculated about the use of [nuclear weapons](/en/nuclear-weapons/t-63414896)
. 

However, this front cover never really existed, and _The Economist_ did not publish such a story. The alleged cover also cannot be found in [the magazine's archive](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive?year=2024 "External link — the magazine's archive")
.

It is a [disinformation tactic](/en/fake-news/t-37038790)
 known as "media spoofing." More and more reputable media outlets around the world are seeing their logos, websites, social media profiles and their look-and-feel hijacked to spread false or misleading narratives. 

This disinformation strategy isn't new but it seems to be growing in several regions of the world, as we can see by the sheer list of recent examples.

One such case is [this screenshot](https://archive.ph/NwIMQ "External link — this screenshot")
 of a false CNN article about [Elon Musk's](/en/elon-musk/t-63587027)
 satellite system Starlink carrying out blackouts in Ukraine after the contentious White House visit by President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 in late February.

Or this [cloned website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230913125635/https:/www.spiegel.ltd/ausland/Sanktionen-gegen-Russland-ruinieren-die-deutsche-Wirtschaft-a-36cbce42-524f-4945-8503-15182c908a97.html "External link — cloned website")
 of German magazine _Der Spiegel_ with the headline "Sanctions against Russia are ruining the German economy."

Or [this website](https://archive.ph/SJvY7 "External link — this website")
, resembling that of French daily _Le Parisien_, saying illegal migrants were a threat to the [2024 Paris Olympics](/en/olympics/t-17351918)
. 

Then there's also [this story](https://archive.ph/j95Jj "External link — this story")
, with the logo of the entertainment site E! News, which said USAID had sponsored celebrity trips to Ukraine. DW's Fact Check department debunked the claim [here](/en/fact-check-trumps-team-targets-usaid-with-false-claims/a-71535712)
, which was reposted by X owner Elon Musk to his 220 million followers and by Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. 

However, this is not only a problem in the United States and Europe. Media outlets around the world, from Israel's [_Haaretz_](https://archive.ph/yBmkw "External link — Haaretz")
 to Nicaragua's [_La Prensa_](https://www.laprensani.com/2025/03/19/nacionales/3449647-circula-noticia-falsa-que-utiliza-la-identidad-de-la-prensa "External link — La Prensa")
, have seen their identity hijacked.

La Prensa newspaper in Nicaragua recently revealed its identity had been cloned, and asked readers to carefully check contentImage: laprensani.com

In addition, academics in Nigeria [studied](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382295421_Between_Trust_and_Misinformation_A_Study_of_User_Engagement_with_Cloned_Pages_of_Daily_Trust_and_Vanguard_Newspapers_on_Facebook "External link — studied")
 several cloned social media profiles, especially on Facebook, of two English-language newspapers, _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_. 

So, what's behind this disinformation problem and what impact does it have?

And most importantly, how can you determine whether the news you're consuming comes from a real source? [DW Fact Check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 has some tips. 

From simple photo manipulation to sophisticated media spoofing 
---------------------------------------------------------------

All these examples show that fabricated news reports can appear in different forms: from very basic images that are edited to distort a text or include a media logo, to complete websites or social media profiles that pretend to be a well-known media organization — so-called "media spoofing."

Some of the fakes also use [artificial intelligence](/en/artificial-intelligence/t-42133476)
 tools. And in most cases, they tend to spread faster during breaking news events like elections, wars, natural disasters or economic crises. 

According to NewsGuard, a misinformation and media watchdog in the US, 40 reliable media organizations have been affected by such impersonations since 2018. And the problem is becoming "more widespread with each passing year."

Most of the instances [found by the watchdog](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/bad-actors-fake-being-real-news-outlets "External link — found by the watchdog")
 are linked to Russian influence operations that spread anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western narratives.

One such operation is called the "Doppelgänger campaign" and began after [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
. In [Germany](/en/russian-disinformation-is-growing-in-germany/a-70506294)
, the Foreign Ministry published a [technical report](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/resource/blob/2682484/2da31936d1cbeb9faec49df74d8bbe2e/technischer-bericht-desinformationskampagne-doppelgaenger-1--data.pdf "External link — technical report")
 last June detailing how the country has been affected by this Russian operation, which included "dozens of forged clones of mainstream media websites." 

German authorities found 'dozens of forged clones of mainstream media websites,' like this fake site of Der Spiegel magazine

McKenzie Sadeghi, who authored NewsGuard's analysis, told DW that this kind of disinformation usually follows a similar pattern: the claims are posted en masse by low-profile accounts on platforms like [Telegram](/en/telegram/t-60588751)
. Some are then picked up by higher-profile individuals, knowingly or unknowingly. 

"The fake continues to gain traction and eventually makes its way into Russian state media, which cites the high-profile figures on social media who share the claim rather than the original Telegram source, completely hiding its actual origins," she said.

Fakes undermining quality of online journalism 
-----------------------------------------------

According to NewsGuard, the media outlets most affected by imitations are BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, investigative journalism group Bellingcat, Fox News, _The Wall Street Journal_ and _USA Today_. [DW has also been a target in recent years](/en/fact-check-fake-news-and-content-targets-international-media/a-62381229)
.

But the pattern, topics and actors are not always the same, as there are clear regional variations.

In Nigeria, cloned pages of _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_ have spread rumors about issues like the [COVID-19 pandemic](/en/covid-19/t-62123668)
, the Boko Haram insurgency or oil prices — topics that have been relevant in the local political debate. 

"Cloned media websites are a huge problem, with potential to undermine the credibility and quality of online journalism, public opinion, the democratic process and social cohesion," Abubakar Tijjani Ibrahim, co-author of the _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_ study and lecturer at Kano State Polytechnic in Nigeria, told DW. 

He added that since cloned media sites lack professional ethics and safeguards, "the handlers of the pages tend to sensationalize, presenting issues in the most provocative way."

The URL of this fake website ended in '.top', while the official URL of Le Parisien ends in '.fr.'

What can you do to verify the content? 
---------------------------------------

Check the authenticity of a piece of information by combining critical observation and analysis with the use of tools that can provide valuable (but not infallible) hints. 

A first suggestion is to look for spelling or grammar mistakes, as well as for uneven spacing or blurry text.

If you have doubts, you can open a separate browser window, go to a search engine and actively look for the real news website. You can then contrast the look and feel of both items. Does anything look odd?

While you're on the real site, you can also carry out a keyword search of the alleged piece of information to see if it appears there. And you can check on other media outlets as well. Cross-checking is always key. If something seems off, then there's a likelihood that the story has been made up.

In the case of a screenshot, you can do a reverse image search, using Google Images or Tin Eye, for example. This could offer guidance as to whether the image was used before and whether the story has already been debunked and fact-checked.

A reverse image search of the Economist "Apocalypse" cover revealed several fact checks that disproved the cover's authenticity.

A reverse image search of a dubious front cover can reveal whether the story has been fact-checkedImage: Google

Regarding media outlets' cloned social media profiles, Ibrahim suggests checking whether the profiles provide links to the official news organization's contact details. One of the clones he analyzed on Facebook offered a Gmail account as a contact option. 

For cloned news websites, a further red flag is the URL or web address. A Google search would normally provide the correct website address. A look at the cloned site could reveal variations.

Remember the fake _Le Parisien_ website mentioned above? There, the URL ended in '.top', while the official URL ends in '.fr.' The same happened with the _Der Spiegel_ website: the official site is www.spiegel.de; the fake one was www.spiegel.ltd.

Sadeghi, of NewsGuard, said a further step could be to check the domain registration records, for instance on the [Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en/offers/whois-b?isc=sem3year&countryview=1&currencyType=EUR&swp_countrycode=DE&cdtl=c_17641286579.g_138121387813.k_kwd-400731202983.a_706593660658.d_c.ctv_g&bnb=b&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwnPS-BhBxEiwAZjMF0tmyXBYuRwTpiUn-erjMOExRdG5eoXShIAGVEhr1taMZGvGfAAIg6RoCtM8QAvD_BwE "External link — Go Daddy")
 platform or on [Who.is](https://who.is/ "External link — Who.is")
.

"There was a fake article on Spiegel.ltd," she explained. "The domain registration records, which are free, and you can look up, showed that it was anonymously registered in June 2022, while the actual domain for the outlet was registered long before." 

In summary, remain vigilant and check whether a story really comes from a reliable news source.

Russian propagandists created counterfeit cover of renowned British magazine to disseminate nuclear threats aimed at Western audiences

The counterfeit cover, circulated by Kremlin-controlled [media outlets](https://msk-news.net/other/2024/11/18/582407.html)
, Russian bots on [X](https://x.com/netsysmx1/status/1858431341609509272)

, features Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump against a backdrop of missiles and an explosion-filled sky. It includes the sensational caption "Apocalypse."

According to these propagandists, the issue's supposed theme is that Western approval for Ukraine's long-range strikes deep into Russian territory marks "the beginning of World War III."

! <image:103>

However, this cover is completely fake. It is not available on [The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 official website or [social media accounts](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
, where authentic covers are consistently published. Notably, the fake cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of all genuine Economist issues.

! <image:104>

! <image:105>

The actual Economist issue published on November 16 depicts a globe being struck by a golf club with the headline ["What's about to hit the world economy?"](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-11-16)
 The magazine's next issue, [scheduled for November 23,](http://https//www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-11-23)
 will focus on U.S. billionaire Elon Musk with the headline "Disrupter-in-chief."

! <image:106>

Some Russian media outlets promoting the fake cover have cited a Telegram channel called "The Economist," which is not affiliated with the British magazine. This channel is known for [disseminating disinformation](https://web.telegram.org/a/#-1002005877458)
 and pro-Kremlin content.

! <image:107>

By spreading such fabrications, Russian propaganda aims to intimidate Ukraine's Western allies, discouraging them from supporting Ukraine or allowing long-range strikes against targets deep in Russian territory. At the same time, these efforts seek to bolster the Kremlin dictator's image amid his increasing political isolation.

### Evidence from `image_search`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that BlackRock is an investor in Ukrainian land. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. One image suggests a claim that "Western owners" want to use the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers as fertilizer, but this is presented as a claim and not a verified fact.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether BlackRock has made any requests or policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Economist published an article on August 10, 2023, about Ukraine having to dig up victims of past wars to bury the dead, which includes an image of a burial (<image:7043>). The New York Times published an article on June 19, 2023, about Ukrainian soldier funerals in Lviv, which includes an image of a funeral (<image:7045>).

Myth Detector contains an image of a coffin draped with a Ukrainian flag. The text on the image, in Russian, translates to "Western owners demand to send the bodies of Ukrainian "heroes" for fertilizer" (<image:7044>). The date of the image is October 5, 2023.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that BlackRock is an investor in Ukrainian land. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. One image suggests a claim that "Western owners" want to use the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers as fertilizer, but this is presented as a claim and not a verified fact.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether BlackRock has made any requests or policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm BlackRock's investment in Ukrainian land but do not provide any information about its policies on the burial of Ukrainian soldiers. The evidence includes images of burials and claims about the use of bodies as fertilizer, but these are not directly linked to BlackRock's policies.

The Economist published an article on August 10, 2023, about Ukraine having to dig up victims of past wars to bury the dead, which includes an image of a burial (<image:7043>). The New York Times published an article on June 19, 2023, about Ukrainian soldier funerals in Lviv, which includes an image of a funeral (<image:7045>).

Myth Detector contains an image of a coffin draped with a Ukrainian flag. The text on the image, in Russian, translates to "Western owners demand to send the bodies of Ukrainian "heroes" for fertilizer" (<image:7044>). The date of the image is October 5, 2023.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that BlackRock is an investor in Ukrainian land. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. One image suggests a claim that "Western owners" want to use the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers as fertilizer, but this is presented as a claim and not a verified fact.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether BlackRock has made any requests or policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land.

The New York Times published an article on June 19, 2023, about Ukrainian soldier funerals in Lviv, which includes an image of a funeral (<image:7045>).

Myth Detector contains an image of a coffin draped with a Ukrainian flag. The text on the image, in Russian, translates to "Western owners demand to send the bodies of Ukrainian "heroes" for fertilizer" (<image:7044>). The date of the image is October 5, 2023.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that BlackRock is an investor in Ukrainian land. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. One image suggests a claim that "Western owners" want to use the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers as fertilizer, but this is presented as a claim and not a verified fact.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether BlackRock has made any requests or policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land.

## Elaboration
The new evidence still does not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. The search results show images of military funerals in Ukraine, but they do not mention BlackRock or its policies.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence indicates that the London summit on Ukraine took place on March 2, 2023, not 2025. The images from Le Monde, Al Jazeera, and ABC News show the leaders at the summit, and none of them depict the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. The image in the claim is not authentic.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:9>)
image_search("London summit on Ukraine March 2 2023 leaders")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Le Monde published an article about the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2023, with a photograph of the leaders (<image:7060>). Al Jazeera also published an article about the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2023, which included a photograph of the leaders at the summit (<image:7061>). ABC News published an article about the London summit on Ukraine, which included a photograph of the leaders at the summit (<image:7062>).

## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that the London summit on Ukraine took place on March 2, 2023, not 2025. The images from Le Monde, Al Jazeera, and ABC News show the leaders at the summit, and none of them depict the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. The image in the claim is not authentic.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is not authentic. The London summit on Ukraine took place in 2023, and the provided evidence does not show the leaders taking off their suits.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/rio-de-janeiro-host-g20-summit-2024-2023-05-09/): 
Content: The Reuters article, published on May 9, 2023, states that Rio de Janeiro will host the G20 summit in 2024. <image:7093>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about whether she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms Giorgia Meloni's presence at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. However, it still lacks any information about her stance on the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the absence of relevant information.

The North Dakota Monitor ([https://northdakotamonitor.com/2025/02/28/repub/trump-zelenskyy-clash-in-oval-office-blowup-over-peace-negotiations/](https://northdakotamonitor.com/2025/02/28/repub/trump-zelenskyy-clash-in-oval-office-blowup-over-peace-negotiations/)) published an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump in the White House. <image:7131>

NPR.org ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting)) also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump. <image:7132> American Progress ([https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-and-vances-disgraceful-oval-office-ambush-of-zelenskyy-comes-at-americas-expense-and-only-benefits-putin/](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-and-vances-disgraceful-oval-office-ambush-of-zelenskyy-comes-at-americas-expense-and-only-benefits-putin/)) includes an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump in the White House. <image:7133>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump met at the White House. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the content of their discussion or any statements made by Zelenskyy regarding the U.S. sending troops to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump. OPB.org ([https://www.opb.org/article/2025/02/28/trump-zelenskyy-white-house-argument/](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/02/28/trump-zelenskyy-white-house-argument/)) <image:7134>, PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-trump-and-zelenskyy-said-during-their-heated-argument-in-the-oval-office](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-trump-and-zelenskyy-said-during-their-heated-argument-in-the-oval-office)) <image:7135>, and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:7136> all published images of the two leaders.


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that there was a "heated argument" between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about the specific statements made by Zelenskyy, particularly the one mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy from AP News ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159)) <image:7138>, ABC News ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-12/volodymyr-zelenskyy-offers-ukraine-land-swap-with-russia/104929254](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-12/volodymyr-zelenskyy-offers-ukraine-land-swap-with-russia/104929254)) <image:7139>, and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts)) <image:7140>. None of the sources mention the specific quote in the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While there is evidence of a meeting and a heated exchange between Zelenskyy and Trump, there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there was a meeting and a heated exchange between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House, there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine after a heated exchange with Donald Trump in February 2025 is not supported by the available evidence. While images confirm a meeting and a heated exchange between the two leaders, no source provides the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

**20 квітня американський телеканал Fox News під час прямої трансляції Великоднього богослужіння [Православної Церкви України](https://suspilne.media/tag/pcu/)
, яке відбувалося у Києві, позначив українську столицю як російське місто.**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

В ефірі [телеканал](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgJs88_Zhog)
 використав трансляцію Суспільне Культура.

Понад 20 хвилин телеканал транслював службу в українській столиці з підписом "Kyiv, Russia".

Після цього канал ще близько пів години транслював Великодню службу з Москви за участю глави Російської Православної Церкви патріарха Кіріла.

В **Міністерстві закордонних справ України** заявили, що телеканал має попросити вибачення за свою помилку та провести розслідування.

> "Якщо це була помилка, а не свідома політична заява, слід вибачитися та розслідувати, хто зробив помилку", — заявив речник МЗС Георгій Тихий.

The broadcast, which used footage from "Suspilne Kultura," showed the text "Kyiv, Russia" for over 20 minutes before correcting the error. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine demanded an apology and investigation. The article was published on April 20. <image:13>

Oroszország neve szerepelt Kijevé mellett az amerikai Fox News csatorna adásában, amelyben a különböző országok húsvéti ünnepségeit mutatták be, [írja](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/20/7508362/)
 az Ukrajinszka Pravda. Többek között az orosz ortodox egyház ceremóniáját is bemutatták, amelyen Vlagyimir Putyin elnök is részt vett, majd nem sokkal később az ukránoké következett.

„Kijev, Ukrajna” – állt a felirat felvétel mellett, majd Ukrajnát egyszer csak kicserélték Oroszországra, amit aztán hosszabb ideig mutattak a képernyőn. Végül azért visszacsatolták Ukrajna fővárosát Ukrajnához.

Mindez jelentős felháborodást keltett az orosz agresszió áldozatául esett ország nyilvánosságában.

Fox news

Američka televizijska mreža **Fox News**, poznata po svojoj **pro-republikanskoj orijentaciji**, izazvala je val kritika i ogorčenja nakon što je na Uskrs emitirala **višeminutni prijenos pravoslavne mise** iz Rusije, na kojoj su prikazani **Vladimir Putin** i **patrijarh Kiril Gundjajev**. Tijekom više od **30 minuta emitiranja**, voditelji su Kijev nazvali “**ruskim gradom**“, što je izazvalo val negativnih reakcija u **Ukrajini**, ali i u **Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama**.

* * *

### **Kritike: “Legitimiziranje zločinaca” i “pranje imidža”**

Emitiranje mise s Putinom u prvom planu i patrijarhom Kirilom, koji je **otvoreno podržavao rusku agresiju na Ukrajinu**, mnogi su gledatelji i analitičari okarakterizirali kao **“legitimizaciju ubojica”**. Na društvenim mrežama zaredale su optužbe da **Fox News pokušava prikazati Putina kao uzornog kršćanina**, unatoč njegovim **neispunjenim obećanjima o uskrsnom primirju**, dok se u isto vrijeme nastavljaju **ruski napadi na ukrajinske gradove**.

* * *

### **Dvostruka mjerila i politička poruka?**

Komentatori su upozorili na **hipokriziju u pristupu**, budući da je televizijska kuća odlučila prikazivati **vjerski događaj** u režiji autokratskog režima, istovremeno **zanemarujući agresiju**, **civilne žrtve** i **ratna razaranja** koje taj isti režim provodi. Posebno je problematična izjava voditelja koji je **Kijev, [glavni grad](https://www.rijekadanas.com/pesut-na-skupstini-liste-za-rijeku-nas-glavni-grad-je-rijeka/)
 Ukrajine, nazvao ruskim gradom** – što je stav u potpunosti suprotan međunarodnom pravu i stajalištima većine zapadnih zemalja.

* * *

### **Reakcije iz Ukrajine**

Ukrajinski korisnici društvenih mreža, novinari i diplomati izrazili su **ogorčenje zbog emitiranja sadržaja koji potiče rusku propagandu**. Mnogi su podsjetili da patrijarh Kiril od početka rata **otvoreno blagoslivlja vojne operacije**, a da sam **Putin koristi vjerske događaje** kako bi prikrio političke i vojne ciljeve.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In February 2025 Elon Musk posted on X that he is planning to suspend Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s X account."

## Actions
```

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images of Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, specifically with Donald Trump. However, the evidence also includes a "FAKE" image discussing the resettlement of Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria.

The evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit to the White House. The "FAKE" image suggests that this information is false.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. The search results also show that Donald Trump and Keir Starmer have interacted and discussed Ukraine-related topics. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without further information. Specifically, the content of the Theo Von interview needs to be examined to confirm if the criticism occurred.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

The search results indicate that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. One source includes an image of the interview (<image:7256>), while another source is an article from The Independent about the interview (<image:7257>). Fox News also reported on the interview (<image:7258>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article about Keir Starmer and Donald Trump discussing a Ukraine peace deal (<image:7265>). CNN published an article on February 27, 2025, about Donald Trump and Keir Starmer (<image:7266>). NBC News has an image of Donald Trump shaking hands with an individual, with flags of the United States and the United Kingdom in the background (<image:7267>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-starmer-discussed-tough-fair-ukraine-peace-deal-with-trump-2025-02-27/), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/trump-starmer-security-guarantees-analysis), and [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/keir-starmer-sees-value-trumps-pursuit-ukrainian-mineral-rights-deal-rcna194047).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. The search results also show that Donald Trump and Keir Starmer have interacted and discussed Ukraine-related topics. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without further information. Specifically, the content of the Theo Von interview needs to be examined to confirm if the criticism occurred.

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [Source](https://www.nsnews.com/local-news/theo-von-vancouver-donald-trump-interview-2024-9379843), [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-cocaine-theo-von-podcast-b2599472.html), and [Source](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-talks-cocaine-biden-health-care-interview-comedian-theo-von).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article about Keir Starmer and Donald Trump discussing a Ukraine peace deal (<image:7265>). CNN published an article on February 27, 2025, about Donald Trump and Keir Starmer (<image:7266>). NBC News has an image of Donald Trump shaking hands with an individual, with flags of the United States and the United Kingdom in the background (<image:7267>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-starmer-discussed-tough-fair-ukraine-peace-deal-with-trump-2025-02-27/), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/trump-starmer-security-guarantees-analysis), and [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/keir-starmer-sees-value-trumps-pursuit-ukrainian-mineral-rights-deal-rcna194047).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. The search results also show that Donald Trump and Keir Starmer have interacted and discussed Ukraine-related topics. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without further information. Specifically, the content of the Theo Von interview needs to be examined to confirm if the criticism occurred.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:20>)
image_search("US drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN reports on the Houthis' attacks on ships in the Red Sea. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/politics/us-navy-houthi-missiles-drones-red-sea](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/politics/us-navy-houthi-missiles-drones-red-sea)) The New York Times published an article on November 8, 2023, about a US drone. ([https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-us-drone.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-us-drone.html)) USNI News reports that U.S. warships shot down Houthi-launched drones. ([https://news.usni.org/2023/12/16/u-k-american-warships-shoot-down-houthi-launched-drones-in-red-sea](https://news.usni.org/2023/12/16/u-k-american-warships-shoot-down-houthi-launched-drones-in-red-sea))

The provided sources discuss Houthi attacks, US drones, and the shooting down of Houthi-launched drones. <image:7298> <image:7299> <image:7300>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there have been incidents involving US drones and Houthi attacks. However, the provided sources do not contain information about the specific image in the claim. The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.

The evidence does not provide any information about the date, location, or the type of missiles used in the alleged attack. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:20>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Israel. This contradicts the claim that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis, as the Houthis are based in Yemen. The evidence does not provide any information about the date, location, or the type of missiles used in the alleged attack.

The claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a scene in Israel, not Yemen, where the Houthis operate. The claim that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis is therefore not accurate.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a scene in Israel, as indicated by the geolocation analysis, contradicting the claim that it shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis in Yemen. The provided evidence, including reports from CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/politics/us-navy-houthi-missiles-drones-red-sea](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/politics/us-navy-houthi-missiles-drones-red-sea)), The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-us-drone.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-us-drone.html)), and USNI News ([https://news.usni.org/2023/12/16/u-k-american-warships-shoot-down-houthi-launched-drones-in-red-sea](https://news.usni.org/2023/12/16/u-k-american-warships-shoot-down-houthi-launched-drones-in-red-sea)), does not support the claim's specific details about the location, date, or the involvement of the Houthis.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The provided evidence does not contain any information to support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments due to his work in the Russia investigation. The search results only provide images of the individuals involved. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide images of John Thune and Adam Schiff but do not offer any information about committee assignments or the reasons behind any potential blocking. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

The decision option that best applies is `false`.


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence, including image searches, does not contain any information to support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments due to his past work in the Russia investigation. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

The search results primarily contained an image of Putin, but no news reports or official statements were found to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that in August 2024, during Joe Biden's presidency, there were discussions and reports about his administration's nuclear strategy, particularly concerning China. The New York Times and The Guardian published articles on this topic ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat)).

Tasnim News also reported on Biden approving a nuclear strategy focused on China ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/08/21/3145608/biden-approves-nuclear-strategy-focusing-on-china-report](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/08/21/3145608/biden-approves-nuclear-strategy-focusing-on-china-report)). However, the provided evidence does not explicitly mention Russia or North Korea in the context of preparing for nuclear confrontations.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported as it relates to China, but the evidence is missing information about Russia and North Korea.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, [we need your help](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/contribute?utm_source=contribute&utm_medium=article "we need your help")

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image depicts destroyed tanks. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine, including articles from The Moscow Times and Sputnik Africa. The image search also provides articles from Al Jazeera and NBC News that mention the Kursk region and show images of tanks. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of specific information about the image's context.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of specific information about the image's context.
