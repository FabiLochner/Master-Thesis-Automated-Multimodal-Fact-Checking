reverse_search(![image 3](media/4.jpg))
image_search("British coffins Ukraine war")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News published an image of a funeral in Ukraine (![image 6147](media/2025-08-29_22-36-1756507019-703639.jpg)). The Los Angeles Times published an article about the war in Ukraine, which includes an image of a funeral procession in Kyiv (![image 6148](media/2025-08-29_22-37-1756507020-684443.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an image of coffins being carried by soldiers (![image 6149](media/2025-08-29_22-37-1756507021-713538.jpg)).

The sources do not mention the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The image search results show funerals in Ukraine, but they do not mention British Special Forces or the Odessa region. The claim lacks supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image search results show funerals in Ukraine, but they do not mention British Special Forces or the Odessa region. The claim lacks supporting evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts coffins draped with the Union Jack, but the provided search results do not corroborate the claim that they belong to British Special Forces killed in the Odessa region of Ukraine. The search results show funerals in Ukraine, but they do not mention British Special Forces or the Odessa region.
