The claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there is evidence of the US providing military aid to Ukraine around February 2025, the exact amount of $350 billion cannot be verified. The search results do not provide the specific amount of aid given during that period. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check could not verify the claim. While evidence confirms the US provided military aid to Ukraine in February 2025, the search results did not provide the specific amount of $350 billion. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.
