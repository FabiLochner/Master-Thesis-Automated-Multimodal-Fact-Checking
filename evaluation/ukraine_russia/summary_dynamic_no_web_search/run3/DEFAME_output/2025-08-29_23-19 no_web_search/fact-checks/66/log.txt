The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While one source depicts a potential invasion plan from China into Russia, and another shows a plan for the occupation of Japan with China as one of the occupying forces, there is no evidence of a joint invasion plan involving both China and Japan against Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
