## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results discuss land ownership in Ukraine, with one source showing a map of land leases (![image 7037](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509631-501257.jpg)) and another listing companies like BlackRock as investors (![image 7038](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509631-646873.jpg)). Another source (![image 7039](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509632-250163.jpg)) mentions BlackRock and Monsanto in relation to Ukraine, including a quote from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Economist published an article on August 10, 2023, about Ukraine having to dig up victims of past wars to bury the dead, which includes an image of a burial (![image 7043](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509641-897854.jpg)). The New York Times published an article on June 19, 2023, about Ukrainian soldier funerals in Lviv, which includes an image of a funeral (![image 7045](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509642-965508.jpg)).

Myth Detector contains an image of a coffin draped with a Ukrainian flag. The text on the image, in Russian, translates to "Western owners demand to send the bodies of Ukrainian "heroes" for fertilizer" (![image 7044](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509642-811448.jpg)). The date of the image is October 5, 2023.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that BlackRock is an investor in Ukrainian land. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. One image suggests a claim that "Western owners" want to use the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers as fertilizer, but this is presented as a claim and not a verified fact.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether BlackRock has made any requests or policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/kyiv-ukraine-military-casualties.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article on February 22, 2022, about military casualties in Kyiv, Ukraine, which includes an image of a coffin being carried by soldiers. ![image 7054](media/2025-08-29_23-20-1756509659-278968.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence still does not provide any information about BlackRock's policies regarding the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns. The search results show images of military funerals in Ukraine, but they do not mention BlackRock or its policies.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.
