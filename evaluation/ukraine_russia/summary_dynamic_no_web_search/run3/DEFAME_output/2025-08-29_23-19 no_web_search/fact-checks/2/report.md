## Elaboration
The Euronews article states that Zelenskyy has not banned Trump's Truth Social platform. This directly contradicts the claim.

Therefore, the claim is false.

The claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A search of Euronews revealed that Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not ban Donald Trump's Truth Social platform, directly contradicting the claim.
