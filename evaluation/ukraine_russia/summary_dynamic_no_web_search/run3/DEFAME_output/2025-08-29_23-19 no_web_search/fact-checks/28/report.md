## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/)) both reported on the letter.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror)) indicates that Wałęsa criticized Trump's treatment of Zelensky.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While Wałęsa wrote a letter to Trump, the specific content regarding the suspension of military aid to Ukraine is not directly confirmed by the provided evidence.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter addressed Trump's treatment of Zelensky. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the delivery of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.
