The claim '<image:21> This image shows an authentic Russian passport of deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Russian internal passport, but there is no evidence to confirm that it belongs to Bashar al-Assad or that it is authentic. The reverse image search revealed the image's presence on Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East\_Slavic\_name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name)) and Wikimedia Commons, identifying it as a Russian internal passport. Further searches did not yield any evidence to support the claim's assertion that the passport belongs to Bashar al-Assad.

So, the overall veracity is: false
