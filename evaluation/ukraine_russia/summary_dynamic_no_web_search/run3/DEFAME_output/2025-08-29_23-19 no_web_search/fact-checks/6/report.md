## Claim
Claim: "![image 5](media/6.jpg) This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 5](media/6.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 5](media/6.jpg)) shows a Russian Air Force MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993. The photo was taken on July 24, 1993, in Fairford, United Kingdom. The pilot can be seen ejecting.

The image is available on websites such as [Airteam Images](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672), [Peakpx](https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-oyvnm), and [Factcheckkorea](https://factcheckkorea.afp.com/doc.afp.com.324U6AA).


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum, not a US F-16 fighter jet. The event occurred in 1993 during a British air show, not in August 2024 over the Black Sea. The image shows a mid-air collision, not a shooting down due to refusal to obey orders.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image shows a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, not a US F-16 fighter jet shot down in 2024. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, as confirmed by reverse image searches on sites like [Airteam Images](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672). This contradicts the claim that it shows a US F-16 shot down in 2024.
