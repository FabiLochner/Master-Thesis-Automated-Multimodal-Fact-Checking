The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Vladimir Putin died in an explosion is demonstrably false. While a limousine from Putin's fleet exploded in Moscow, there is no evidence to suggest Putin was in the car or died. Furthermore, subsequent reports from sources like Al Jazeera and PBS indicate that Putin is alive, with the latter reporting on a failed assassination attempt.

So, the overall veracity is: false
