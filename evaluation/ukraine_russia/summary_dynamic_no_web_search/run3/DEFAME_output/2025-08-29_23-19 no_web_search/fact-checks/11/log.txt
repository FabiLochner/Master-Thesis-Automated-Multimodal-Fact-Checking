Content: The search result from DW.com states that the claim about Zelenskyy's wife buying a Bugatti is fake. The article includes an image <image:7058> of a social media post that mentions a car purchase by "Zelenskaya" for almost 4 million euros, with 500,000 euros worth of options, to be received in 2026.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do): 
Content: The BBC published an image of a Bugatti invoice addressed to Mrs. Olena Zelenska, with a delivery address in Paris. The invoice date is 07/06/2024. The total vehicle price is 4,462,400.00. The image has a "FALSE" stamp on it. <image:7059>
