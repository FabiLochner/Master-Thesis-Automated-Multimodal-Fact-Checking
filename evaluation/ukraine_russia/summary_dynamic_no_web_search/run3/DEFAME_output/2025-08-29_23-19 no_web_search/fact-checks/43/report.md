## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a presidential candidate ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rfk-jr-now-presidential-candidate-ukraine-vaccines-economy/story?id=100247005](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rfk-jr-now-presidential-candidate-ukraine-vaccines-economy/story?id=100247005)). ![image 7201](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756509989-413523.jpg) Politico has an article about what Johnson wants for Ukraine and Israel funding ([https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/11/01/congress/what-johnson-wants-ukraine-israel-funding-00124806](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/11/01/congress/what-johnson-wants-ukraine-israel-funding-00124806)). The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article that includes an image of Mitch McConnell, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Chuck Schumer ([https://cepa.org/article/ignore-the-noise-congress-can-still-pass-ukraine-aid/](https://cepa.org/article/ignore-the-noise-congress-can-still-pass-ukraine-aid/)). ![image 7202](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756509989-865006.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
Bloomberg published an article on May 3, 2024, about Ukraine tightening military procurement after a corruption shakeup (![image 7212](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756510000-179065.jpg)). The Policy Practice published an article about Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts (![image 7213](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756510000-739728.jpg)). The Institute for the Study of War published a fact sheet about US assistance to Ukraine, which states that US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability are extensive and growing (![image 7214](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756510000-986567.jpg)).

The provided sources discuss corruption and oversight related to aid to Ukraine but do not mention any laundering or diversion of funds to Democrat candidates.


## Elaboration
The evidence reveals discussions about US aid to Ukraine, including articles on corruption and oversight. However, none of the provided sources support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The Institute for the Study of War fact sheet ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet)) indicates extensive US and Ukrainian government oversight.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim remains unsubstantiated.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there are discussions about US aid to Ukraine and related corruption concerns, there is no evidence to support the claim that half of the aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The provided sources do not mention any such activity. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that half of US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. While there are reports about corruption and oversight related to the aid, none of the sources, including articles from Reuters, ABC News, Politico, Bloomberg, and the Institute for the Study of War ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet)), mention any such activity.
