## Elaboration
The evidence includes an image of a social media post that claims Zelenskyy acquired the Kehlsteinhaus. However, the post is marked with a red "X", suggesting the claim is false. The search results also provide images of the Kehlsteinhaus.

## Final Judgement
The evidence includes a social media post claiming Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest, but the post is marked as incorrect. Other search results show images of the Eagle's Nest.

The claim is demonstrably false as the provided evidence suggests the claim is incorrect. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest is demonstrably false. The evidence includes a social media post making the claim, but it is marked as incorrect.
