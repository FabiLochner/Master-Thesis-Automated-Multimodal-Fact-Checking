Content: Al Jazeera published an article reviewing how the Russia-Ukraine war unfolded (<image:7196>).

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-russia-ukraine-war-and-its-ramifications-for-russia/): 
Content: The Brookings article discusses the Russia-Ukraine war and includes an image showing Ukraine's gains in the eastern counteroffensive (<image:7197>). The article mentions Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article was published on October 5, 2022.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Evidence, including a timeline from [DW](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-crisis-timeline-how-events-unfolded/g-60998676), indicates that Russia initiated the war on February 24, 2022, not Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

So, the overall veracity is: false
