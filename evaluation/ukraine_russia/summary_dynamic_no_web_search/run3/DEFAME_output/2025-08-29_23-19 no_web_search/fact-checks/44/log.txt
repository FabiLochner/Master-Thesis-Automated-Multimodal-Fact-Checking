Useful result: From [Source](https://kansasreflector.com/2024/10/10/biden-slams-trump-as-damn-un-american-urges-congress-to-speed-up-hurricane-aid/): 
Content: Kansas Reflector published an article on October 10, 2024, about Joe Biden's remarks regarding Hurricane Helene. <image:7234>

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence confirms that President Biden made remarks and visited areas affected by Hurricane Helene, as reported by sources like the [Kansas Reflector](https://kansasreflector.com/2024/10/10/biden-slams-trump-as-damn-un-american-urges-congress-to-speed-up-hurricane-aid/). However, the provided sources do not contain any information about the content of these remarks, specifically whether he announced the cessation of aid for areas affected by Hurricane Helene or the allocation of additional funds to Ukraine. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
