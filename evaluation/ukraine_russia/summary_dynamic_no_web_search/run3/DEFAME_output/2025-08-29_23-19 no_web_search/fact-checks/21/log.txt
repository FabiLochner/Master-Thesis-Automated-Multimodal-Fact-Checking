Useful result: From [Source](https://www.vozdeamerica.com/a/sheinbaum-no-califico-a-zelenskyy-como-un-drogadicto/7810858.html): 
Content: The Voice of America published an article on September 18, 2024, stating that there is no record of Claudia Sheinbaum referring to Zelenskyy as a "drug addict." <image:7107>

The claim 'Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to Ukraine by Volodymr Zelenskyy and said towards him on September 17, 2024: 'If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Claudia Sheinbaum did decline an invitation to visit Ukraine, the quote attributed to her is fabricated, as confirmed by fact-checking sources like StopFake.org and Voice of America.

So, the overall veracity is: false
