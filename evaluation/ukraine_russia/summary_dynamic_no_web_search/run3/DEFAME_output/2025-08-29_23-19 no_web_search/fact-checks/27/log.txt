The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence indicates that Zelenskyy did not purchase a Florida mansion, contradicting the claim ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction)). While Zelenskyy's income has been published ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/)), the other details in the claim, such as the number of homes, bank account details, and monthly income, are not supported by the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
