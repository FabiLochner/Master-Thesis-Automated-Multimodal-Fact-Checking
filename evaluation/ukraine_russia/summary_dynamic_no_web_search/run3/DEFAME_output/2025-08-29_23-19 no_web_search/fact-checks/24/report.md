### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of Howard Buffett with Volodymyr Zelenskyy from [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine) ![image 7121](media/2025-08-29_23-22-1756509769-924007.jpg). Another source from [Philanthropy News Digest](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/other-sources/article/?id=14667666&title=US-philanthropist-pledges-$300-million-for-Ukraine-in-2024) mentions a US philanthropist pledging $300 million for Ukraine in 2024 ![image 7122](media/2025-08-29_23-22-1756509770-132742.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Howard Buffett, not Warren Buffett, has been involved in donating to Ukraine. The Business Insider article shows Howard Buffett with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Philanthropy News Digest mentions a $300 million pledge by a US philanthropist.

The evidence does not provide information about Warren Buffett's donations to Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, information about Warren Buffett's donations to Ukraine since 2022 is needed.
