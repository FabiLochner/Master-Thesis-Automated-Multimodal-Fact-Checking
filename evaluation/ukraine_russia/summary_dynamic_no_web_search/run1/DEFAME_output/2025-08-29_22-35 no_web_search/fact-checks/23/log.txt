The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence does not contain the specific amount of military aid the United States provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. While the search results mention U.S. aid and related discussions, they lack the necessary data to confirm the claim of $350 billion. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
