The claim '<image:21> This image shows an authentic Russian passport of deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of a Russian passport, as evidenced by its appearance in a Wikipedia article and on websites discussing Russian internal passports. However, the fact-check did not find any evidence to confirm that the passport belongs to Bashar al-Assad or that it is authentic, thus the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
