# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In January 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin was seeking to have Dr. Anthony Fauci in the U.S. extradited to Russia in exchange for ending the war in Ukraine."

## Actions
```
image_search("Vladimir Putin Anthony Fauci extradition")
image_search("Russia Ukraine war peace deal Fauci extradition")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles from ABC News ([Source](https://abcnews.go.com/US/fauci-doubts-russias-covid-19-vaccine-safe-effective/story?id=72309297)), Duke ([Source](https://dhvi.duke.edu/news/experts-express-doubts-over-russias-vaccine-claim)), and National Geographic ([Source](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/fauci-seriously-doubts-russia-coronavirus-vaccine-is-ready-cvd)).

The ABC News and National Geographic articles feature images of Dr. Anthony Fauci (<image:6317>, <image:6319>). The Duke article includes an image of Vladimir Putin (<image:6318>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
An Al Jazeera article from March 12, 2025, discusses a 30-day ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war (<image:6323>). Another source contains an image of soldiers (<image:6325>).

The other source has no content.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results provide images of Fauci and Putin, and mention the Russia-Ukraine war, but do not mention any extradition attempts or negotiations. The Al Jazeera article from March 2025 discusses a ceasefire, but it does not mention Fauci or extradition.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.
