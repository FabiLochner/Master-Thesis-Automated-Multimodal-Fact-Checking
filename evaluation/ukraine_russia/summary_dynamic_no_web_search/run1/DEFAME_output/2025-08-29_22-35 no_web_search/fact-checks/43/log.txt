Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/heres-how-much-aid-the-u-s-has-sent-to-ukraine): 
Content: PBS published an article about US aid to Ukraine, which includes a chart showing the amount of aid provided by the US and other countries (<image:6384>).

The claim 'Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While the US has provided significant aid to Ukraine, and there are discussions about corruption risks, there is no evidence to suggest that half of the aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The search results include articles about US aid, corruption in Ukraine, and the amounts of aid provided by different countries, such as the BBC's article on the largest donors of military aid to Ukraine ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64726596](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64726596)), but none of them support the specific claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
