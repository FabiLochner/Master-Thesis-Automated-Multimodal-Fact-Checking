## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin (![image 14](media/47.jpg)) is fake. According to [DW.COM](https://www.dw.com/en/satire-magazine-charlie-hebdo-pokes-panama-papers-victims/a-19166607), the image was found on a website with the title "Charlie Hebdo: Je suis Panama".

The website [without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/) states that the cover is a fake and that the real cover for March 19, 2025, was different. [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/) also confirms the image is fabricated and was first posted on March 22 by Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo did not release an issue on March 20, 2025, and the issue number (1705) on the image matches the one published on March 26.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image of the Charlie Hebdo cover is fabricated. Multiple sources confirm that the cover is not authentic, and the issue number and publication date do not align with the magazine's actual releases.


## Final Judgement
The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication. Multiple sources confirm that the cover is not authentic, and the issue number and publication date do not align with the magazine's actual releases.

The most appropriate decision option is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/) and [without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/), which highlight inconsistencies in the publication date and issue number.
