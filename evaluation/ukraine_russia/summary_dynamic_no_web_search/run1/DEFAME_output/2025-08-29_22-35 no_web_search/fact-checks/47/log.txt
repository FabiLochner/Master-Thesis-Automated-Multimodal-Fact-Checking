Content: The search result from Myth Detector, published on April 8, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin. <image:6418> The article states that the image is fake and was first posted on March 22 by Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo did not release an issue on March 20, 2025, and the issue number (1705) on the image matches the one published on March 26. <image:6418>, <image:6419>, <image:6420>.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/) and [without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/), which highlight inconsistencies in the publication date and issue number.
