## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of The Economist cover featuring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is altered and not authentic. PesaCheck states that the original cover from March 16, 2024, did not include the images of Trump and Putin ([https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b)). DW also mentions the fake cover in an article about fabricated news reports ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-how-to-spot-fabricated-news-reports/a-71992819](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-how-to-spot-fabricated-news-reports/a-71992819)).

Ukrinform reports that the image is a fake cover created by Russian propagandists, lacking a publication date, and is being used to disseminate nuclear threats ([https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html)). The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, featured a different cover ![image 106](media/2025-08-06_17-27-1754501266-362811.jpg), and the next issue, scheduled for November 23, 2024, will focus on Elon Musk ![image 107](media/2025-08-06_17-27-1754501267-025802.jpg). The fake cover is being used to disseminate nuclear threats aimed at Western audiences ![image 104](media/2025-08-06_17-27-1754501264-243359.jpg).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/22/caught-between-putin-and-trump):

The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, had a different cover, and the next issue, scheduled for November 23, 2024, will focus on Elon Musk.
