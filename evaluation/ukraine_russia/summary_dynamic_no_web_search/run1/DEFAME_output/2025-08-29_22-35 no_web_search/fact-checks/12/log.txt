The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, is not supported by the evidence. While the summit did take place, images from the event, as reported by sources like Al Jazeera and ABC News, show the leaders wearing suits, and no evidence suggests they removed them.

So, the overall veracity is: false
