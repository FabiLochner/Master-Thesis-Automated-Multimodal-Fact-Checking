## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican President-elect, declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. The search results from Ukrinform ([https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3906832-mexico-presidentelect-rejects-zelenskys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine.html](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3906832-mexico-presidentelect-rejects-zelenskys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine.html)) and Euromaidan Press ([https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/)) support this.

However, the evidence does not contain any information about the alleged statement made by Sheinbaum on September 17, 2024, regarding Volodymyr Zelenskyy and drug addiction.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the alleged quote.
