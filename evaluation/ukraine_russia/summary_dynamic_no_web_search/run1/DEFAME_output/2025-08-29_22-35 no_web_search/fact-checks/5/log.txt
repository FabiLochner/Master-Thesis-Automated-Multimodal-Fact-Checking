Content: The article from Truthmeter.mk, published on November 4, 2024, debunks the claim that Volodymyr Zelensky bought Hitler's Mercedes-Benz 770 for $15 million. The article states that the image is a montage and the claim originates from the "news portal" Seattle Tribune, which was created shortly before the news was published. The article also mentions that the car was auctioned in Arizona, USA, in 2018. <image:4>, <image:167>. The article also provides links to other fact-checking sources.

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Hitler's parade car which was bought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 15 Million US-$.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including The Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propagandists-push-fake-story-that-zelenskyy-bought-hitler-s-car/7818175.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propagandists-push-fake-story-that-zelenskyy-bought-hitler-s-car/7818175.html)), debunk the claim, stating the image is doctored and the story originated from disinformation. The car in the image was auctioned in 2018 and purchased by Clive Palmer in February 2022, not Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

So, the overall veracity is: false
