The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of a phone call between Trump and Putin on February 12, 2025, and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Trump announced an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on that date, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/trump-says-putin-wants-peace-will-begin-talks-on-ending-ukraine-war).
