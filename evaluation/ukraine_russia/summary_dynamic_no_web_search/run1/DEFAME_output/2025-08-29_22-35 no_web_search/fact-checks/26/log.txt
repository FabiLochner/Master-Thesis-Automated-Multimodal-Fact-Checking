The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine after a heated exchange with Donald Trump in February 2025 is unverified. While evidence confirms a meeting and a heated exchange between the two leaders in the White House, no sources provide the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
