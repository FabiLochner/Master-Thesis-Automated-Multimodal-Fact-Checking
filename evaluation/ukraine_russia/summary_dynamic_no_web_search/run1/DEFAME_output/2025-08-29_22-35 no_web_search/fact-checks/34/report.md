Global News reports that Joe Rogan said he would rather go to Russia than Canada (![image 6310](media/2025-08-29_22-43-1756507386-180853.jpg)). The Toronto Sun reports that Joe Rogan said he would rather go to Russia than to a UFC event in Canada (![image 6311](media/2025-08-29_22-43-1756507386-884692.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Rogan made statements about preferring to go to Russia over Canada. However, the exact wording of the claim is not entirely accurate. The Toronto Sun article indicates that Rogan's statement was specifically in the context of a UFC event in Canada. The Newsweek and Global News articles do not specify the context. The evidence does not provide the exact date of the statement, but the articles were published in March 2024.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the context and date need to be clarified.


## Final Judgement
Joe Rogan did make statements about preferring to go to Russia over Canada. However, the context of the statement is not entirely clear, and the exact wording of the claim is not entirely accurate. The articles were published in March 2024, not March 2025.

The claim is partially accurate, but the context and date need to be clarified. `false`
