Useful result: From [Source](https://kfor.com/news/international/ap-ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-us-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/):

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified because, while the evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to AP on February 1, 2025, the content of the interview, specifically the statements about U.S. aid, is not available in the search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
