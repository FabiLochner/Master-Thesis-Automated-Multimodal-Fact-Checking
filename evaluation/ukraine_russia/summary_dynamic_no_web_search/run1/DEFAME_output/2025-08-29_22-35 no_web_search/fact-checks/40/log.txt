The claim 'In February 2025 Elon Musk posted on X that he is planning to suspend Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s X account.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence, including articles from Al Jazeera, The Guardian, and NDTV, does not contain any information to support the claim that Elon Musk posted on X in February 2025 about suspending Volodymyr Zelenskyy's account. Subsequent searches also failed to find any evidence to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
