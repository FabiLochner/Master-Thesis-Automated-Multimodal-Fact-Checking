The Guardian published an article on June 17, 2025, with an image of Elon Musk (![image 6343](media/2025-08-29_22-44-1756507455-487200.jpg)) ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/17/elon-musk-new-york-hate-lawsuit-speech-law)).

## Elaboration
The evidence includes articles from Al Jazeera, The Guardian, and NDTV, all mentioning Elon Musk. However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that Elon Musk posted on X in February 2025 about suspending Volodymyr Zelenskyy's account. The NDTV article shows an image of both Musk and Zelenskyy, but it does not confirm the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 30, 2024, with an image of Elon Musk (![image 6353](media/2025-08-29_22-44-1756507477-214381.jpg)). The Intercept published an article with an image of an Elon Musk tweet (![image 6355](media/2025-08-29_22-44-1756507477-957830.jpg)).

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement

The claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`
