The claim 'In February 2025 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blocked access to US President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social across Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/26/zelenskyy-hasnt-banned-trumps-truth-social-platform)) indicates that Zelenskyy did not ban Trump's Truth Social platform.

So, the overall veracity is: false
