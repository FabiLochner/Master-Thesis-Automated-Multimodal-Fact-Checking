The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: While a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet exploded in Moscow, as reported by sources like [India Today](<image:6531>) and [The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/limousine-from-putins-official-car-fleet-explodes-near-fsb-secret-service-headquarters-details-inside/3793071/), there is no evidence to suggest that Putin was in the car or died in the explosion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
