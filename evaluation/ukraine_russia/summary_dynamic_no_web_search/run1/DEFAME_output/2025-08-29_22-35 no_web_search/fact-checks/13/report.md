## Actions

reverse_search(![image 10](media/13.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020 (![image 10](media/13.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. The evidence indicates that the event took place on January 22, 2020, in Davos.

The claim states that the image was taken after the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken in January 2020, which is before the invasion.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the timing of the event.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020. The claim states that the image was taken after the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the event occurred before the invasion.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020, as evidenced by a reverse image search. The claim incorrectly states that the image was taken after the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began later.
