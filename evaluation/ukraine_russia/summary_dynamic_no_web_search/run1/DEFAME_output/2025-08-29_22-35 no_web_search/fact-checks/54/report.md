### Evidence from `image_search`

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals that Ukraine has faced corruption issues, including officials stealing funds intended for arms purchases. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine, let alone the claim that it is half of the received armaments.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to assess the veracity of the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. is a major provider of military hardware to Ukraine, and there are efforts to track the supplied gear. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the volume of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. The information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine is still missing.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Ukraine has faced corruption issues and that the U.S. is a major provider of military hardware to Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. Therefore, the claim is unverified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of corruption in Ukraine and the U.S. providing significant military aid, there is no information to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.
