The claim 'U.S. Vice President JD Vance's cousin Nate Vance fought in Ukraine for three years during its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance's cousin, Nate Vance, fought in Ukraine for three years cannot be verified. While evidence from sources like the [Kyiv Post](https://kyivpost.com/) and [SOFREP](https://sofrep.com/) confirms Nate Vance's involvement in the war in Ukraine, the provided information does not specify the duration of his service.

So, the overall veracity is: false
