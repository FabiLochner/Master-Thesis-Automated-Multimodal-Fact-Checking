The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the evidence includes information about the wealth of US politicians and US aid to Ukraine, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The provided sources, such as those from the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/faa721e6-4fcf-4b9b-ae39-9ad6c44ed971) and [Roll Call](https://rollcall.com/2016/11/28/net-worth-of-leaders-held-stable-during-tough-2015-investment-year/), discuss the wealth of politicians and US aid to Ukraine, but they do not mention any bribes or a list released by Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
