# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss military parades in Poland. One article from Militarnyi.com covers a large-scale parade dedicated to the Day of the Polish Army. Another article from KSAT reports on a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024. <image:6625>, <image:6626>

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about a military parade in Poland, including an image of tanks (<image:6627>). Al Jazeera reports that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2023 (<image:6628>). The Globe and Mail also published an article about Poland's military parade, including an image of tanks (<image:6629>).

The articles do not mention the date August 14, 2024, or any preparation for war with Russia.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that Poland held military parades, including one on August 15, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the parade was on August 14, 2024, or that it was preparing for war with Russia.

For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about a military parade in Poland, including an image of tanks (<image:6627>). Al Jazeera reports that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2023 (<image:6628>). The Globe and Mail also published an article about Poland's military parade, including an image of tanks (<image:6629>).

The articles do not mention the date August 14, 2024, or any preparation for war with Russia.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that Poland held military parades, including one on August 15, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the parade was on August 14, 2024, or that it was preparing for war with Russia.


# Your Judgement

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is inaccurate. While Poland did hold a military parade, the evidence suggests it occurred on August 15, 2024, not August 14, 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia. Sources like [KSAT](https://www.ksat.com/news/world/2024/08/15/poland-showcases-its-growing-army-on-a-holiday-that-celebrates-its-historic-defeat-of-the-red-army/) and [Militarnyi.com](https://militarnyi.com/en/news/a-large-scale-parade-dedicated-to-the-day-of-the-polish-army-took-place-in-poland/) confirm the parade but do not mention the date or the war preparation.
