The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim is inaccurate. While Poland did hold a military parade, the evidence suggests it occurred on August 15, 2024, not August 14, 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia. Sources like [KSAT](https://www.ksat.com/news/world/2024/08/15/poland-showcases-its-growing-army-on-a-holiday-that-celebrates-its-historic-defeat-of-the-red-army/) and [Militarnyi.com](https://militarnyi.com/en/news/a-large-scale-parade-dedicated-to-the-day-of-the-polish-army-took-place-in-poland/) confirm the parade but do not mention the date or the war preparation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
