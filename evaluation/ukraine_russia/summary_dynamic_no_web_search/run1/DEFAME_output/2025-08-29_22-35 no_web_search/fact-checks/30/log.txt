The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check revealed evidence of meetings between Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine in Istanbul in June 2025, as shown in a [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl). However, the provided sources do not explicitly confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025, thus the claim remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
