Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car

Print

washington — 

The article in the Seattle Tribune had everything: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Adolf Hitler and a $15 million classic car. Unsurprisingly, it spread like wildfire across Russia's state and pro-Kremlin media.

But the subject was a strange one for a news site about a U.S. city; such outlets usually cover only local stories.

In fact, the article with headline "Hitler's parade car bought by Ukraine's Zelensky" was another fake spread by Russian propaganda.

There is no such media outlet as the Seattle Tribune, just a website masquerading as a full-fledged publication. And the article itself was a compilation of Russia's disinformation "greatest hits" about Ukraine — "Nazism," "unrestrained corruption" and "wasting American aid."

According to the phony news article, Zelenskyy was spotted in Kyiv exiting a Mercedes-Benz 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, Adolf Hitler's parade car. The sighting supposedly occurred just days after the Ukrainian leader returned from Washington, where the U.S. government had allocated an $8 billion aid package to his country.

The article featured a screenshot of a post by the Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel Realna Viyna ("Real War" in Ukrainian) featuring a photo of the vehicle parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv.

A screenshot of a fake Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel post includes a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

However, beyond the Seattle Tribune news site not actually existing, the article had several other glaring problems.

First, Realna Viyna did not publish the post in the screenshot. Second, the image of "Hitler's car" was stolen from a photo widely available on the internet that was digitally edited into an image of the Ukrainian presidential administration building.

!A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration. <image:164>

A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

VOA found that the angle of photo in the screenshot, a black spot on the asphalt under the car's running board, and the reflection on the front windshield completely match the image of the Mercedes-Benz 770K found across the internet.

Third, the Seattle Tribune website was registered on October 3, 2024, just six days before the fake article was published. And the registration was set for only one year.

The Seattle Tribune appears to belong to a network of disinformation websites controlled by John Mark Dougan, an American living in Russia, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who fact checks and debunks disinformation at the BBC.

He noted on social network X that creating fake local American news sites is Dougan's standard approach. That conclusion matches VOA's observations about Dougan's network.

A former deputy sheriff in Florida, Dougan was charged with extortion and wiretapping in the United States. In 2016, he fled to Russia and later received political asylum there.

He now operates at least 167 disinformation sites that often publish narratives serving Russian interests, according to a May 2024 investigation by [NewsGuard.](https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/special-report-newsguard-and-new-book-expose-global-disinformation-reach-of-moscow-based-former-florida-sheriffs-deputy/)

[Dougan's sites](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)
 previously attracted widespread attention for spreading a fake story claiming that Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, had purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti supercar during a visit to France for commemorations of the D-Day landing.

That story seemed to be aimed at a Western audience. The fake "Hitler car" story, however, is mostly spreading in the Russian information space. In a message on the Telegram messenger, Dougan told VOA that he was unaware of the Seattle Tribune_._

"Never heard of it. But I looked it up \[and\] heard there's lots of great information on there. A real pillar of journalistic integrity, on par with the NYT, CNN and MSNBC," he wrote, referring to _The New York Times_ and two major U.S. TV news channels.

As is often the case with higher-quality fakes, the phony story about Hitler's parade car combines a fictitious narrative about Zelenskyy with real facts about the sale of a former Nazi parade car in the United States.

The factual information comes from an article in a real American newspaper: _The Seattle Times,_ which reported in February 2018 that [the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-hitlers-car-ended-up-parked-in-medina/)
 after having been put up for auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, a month earlier.

While the vehicle did not sell at the auction, it soon found a buyer. After that, the "Hitler car" was briefly unloaded from a truck in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Medina, where it attracted the attention of a local resident, who told _The Seattle Times_ about it. Later, the car was likely reloaded onto the truck and taken way.

The director of the auction company Worldwide Auctioneers, Rod Egan (his name was also mentioned in the fake Seattle Tribune story), refused to tell _The Seattle Time_s the buyer of the car, citing a non-disclosure agreement.

However, Egan said the car's ultimate destination was "very, very far away" outside the United States.

_The Seattle Times_ article also cited a German media report that six such cars were bought by a Russian billionaire in 2009. Among them was the vehicle mentioned in the fake article.

The fake story about Zelenskyy and the "Hitler car" also recalled a scene from the 2001 American comedy film "Rat Race," in which actor Jon Lovitz steals Hitler's parade car from a fictional museum of Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie and then crashes it into a gathering of American World War II veterans.

Asked whether he was familiar with the film and scene, Dougan replied, "Comedy gold right there."

Russian media spread hoax about Zelensky buying Hitler’s car for $15 million
============================================================================

11 October 2024

[](/en/authors/the-insider)

[##### The Insider](/en/authors/the-insider)

[**_RU_**](https://theins.press/antifake/275180)

A series of fake publications about President Volodymyr Zelensky's alleged multi-million dollar purchases — including a hotel with a casino in Northern Cyprus, a winery in Tuscany that belonged to a famous British musician, and a brand new Bugatti for Ukraine’s First Lady — has been updated with an unbelievable new addition: the story that Zelensky has ostensibly purchased Adolf Hitler's parade car and drives it around Kyiv. The Russian tabloid _Moskovsky Komsomolets_ ”[reports](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/10/08/zelenskiy-kupil-mersedes-gitlera-za-astronomicheskuyu-summu.html)
”:

> “Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased a car that belonged to Adolf Hitler. The Nazi Fuhrer rode in this Mercedes at the parade in Berlin after the surrender of France in 1940. The purchase was reported by _Seattle Tribune_.

> “As the publication writes, the car was noticed in the center of Kyiv in early October. It had brought Zelensky to the administration building on Bankova Street. This happened shortly after Zelensky returned from his American tour.

> “The article says that the amount Zelensky paid for the Mercedes-Benz 770k is unknown, but experts estimate its value as approximately $15 million. The Nazi dictator's car was confiscated by the U.S. Army after the war ended.”

_Argumenty i Fakty_ throws in some [details](https://aif.ru/politics/world/seattle-tribune-zelenskiy-kupil-paradnyy-limuzin-gitlera)
:

> “The United States attempted to auction the car in 2018. The endeavor failed because the $7 million bid fell short of the expected value. Subsequently, representatives stated they were negotiating the sale of the car with a client outside the U.S.”

![](/images/PJA9qLuVPnDCVQFT36GVoRhJDpYG41YEEmwqC8KGZzk/rs:fill:433:562:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5NzYv/ZmlsZS00NzdjMDlh/MGQ3NGVlMjEyNTRl/NmU4NDI0ZjU5Mjdl/Zi5qcGc.jpg)

The failed 2018 auction story is true — except that the negotiations did in fact end in February 2022, with the car being [purchased](https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/australian-politician-clive-palmer-buys-hitlers-mercedes-from-russian-tycoon-hlzpn20vf)
 by Australian national Clive Palmer for his future car museum. According to _The Times_, its previous owner was a Russian tycoon who had bought the car for more than $7 million. However, after Palmer was suspected in Australia of violating the anti-Russian sanctions regime and glorifying Nazism, he [denied](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-02/clive-palmer-reportedly-buys-hitlers-car/100874720)
 the purchase.

_Seattle Tribune_, which first wrote about Zelensky's purchase of the car, is one of many fake publications created to plant dirt against Putin’s enemies. Olena Zelenska's fictional purchase of a Bugatti was reported by the non-existent French publication _Vérité Cachée_ in July 2024 using a similar method. The website of _Seattle Tribune_ was registered just a few days ago, and the Internet Archive [shows](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003162854/https:/seattle-tribune.com/)
 that on Oct. 3, 2024, it was completely empty.

![](/images/n_infmIDLGIc64dpaqUUZFl0ar-9-4ysK9mh30_K6v0/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzcv/ZmlsZS0yNzVhNzRh/MTg4MzVlYWZlZmZl/MDRmMDk2MDdlNGM0/YS5qcGc.jpg)

The pseudo-American publication [presents](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
 a screenshot ostensibly captured from the Ukrainian Telegram channel “Real War | Ukraine | News” with a photo of a car outside the Ukrainian president's office building.

![](/images/BKCFlFjgqajb2a869v73hlrvaWyQRlD2DYAySfdwh9A/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzgv/ZmlsZS01ZTgzNWU0/OTliZGNhMzc5NjQz/MjQ3YzIzNGNmYzcx/OC5qcGc.jpg)

Of course, the channel published no such post, and the image itself was doctored. The car was cut from a photo that [illustrated](https://ru.axar.az/news/vmire/235827.html)
 the auction announcements on various websites in 2017.

![](/images/jImvSXip56iyK9-6Y6tFeFIZ5IH0sg4LmaY1Wiy8Xwg/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzkv/ZmlsZS02NDA5ZWM2/OTM2YmJhYzJjZTc4/ZDdjMjExN2E2M2Q3/Yy5qcGc.jpg)

As we can see, tree reflections in the fenders of the car in the two images match — and there are no trees this big anywhere near the building on Bankova Street. The authors of the hoax only tried to blur the reflection of the American police car in the door, and they weren't too thorough about it, leaving visible traces of the partially erased reflection. The license plates are blurred too — an understandable move for the original 2017 photo, when the car belonged to a private owner — but why would one care to hide the license plates of a presidential car that Zelensky purportedly uses to get to his office and drive around Kyiv?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is once again the target of disinformation for allegedly spending money intended for the Ukrainian Army. This time, it is claimed he bought the famous Mercedes-Benz 770, whose most famous owner was Hitler. The claims come from the “news portal” Seattle Tribune, created a few days before the breaking news, while the main source is a manipulated screenshot from Telegram. Not only such a photo does not exist on the Telegram group that is quoted, the illustration is also a montage of two different pictures. This new attack on Zelensky comes only a few days after his visit to the United States, where he presented his “Victory Plan”

Disinformation attacks on Ukrainian President **Volodymyr** **Zelensky** have been a constant since the war in Ukraine started. This time, it is claimed he allegedly bought the “Mercedes-Benz 770” car or the “Großer Mercedes” (the “Grand Mercedes”) of the infamous dictator of Nazi Germany, **Adolf Hitler,** for 15 million dollars**.** It is true the “Mercedes-Benz 770” was one of the most famous and most used models in the ranks of the Nazi Party in Germany and that it was this car which Hitler used for the [victory parade in France](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html#:~:text=Hitler%20used%20it%20for%20a%20victory%20parade%20after%20the%20Nazis%E2%80%99%20swift%20defeat%20of%20France)
. However, as early as 2018, the car was auctioned in [Arizona, USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html)
. This disinformation was also fact-checked by numerous colleagues from Lithuania ([15min](https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/pasaulis/ar-tiesa-kad-v-zelenskis-isigijo-a-hitlerio-automobili-57-2323218)

 and [Center for Countering Disinformation](https://cpd.gov.ua/en/international-threats-en/fake-about-zelenskyys-purchase-of-hitlers-parade-car/)

, [Australia](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/russian-disinformation-campaign-accuses-zelensky-of-spending-millions-on-cars/)
, as well as the diplomatic service of the EU, [EUvsDisinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/zelenskyy-buys-hitlers-mercedes/)

“The news” has started to spread relatively quickly in the Baltic states and Ukraine, with a picture or [video](https://www.facebook.com/psimeonoff/videos/570591355306096)
 being shared, as well as a direct link from the website [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
, which at first sight resembles a real news portal.

**Photo: Screenshot from [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
**

However, numerous problematic moments surrounding the portal can be recognized immediately. Firstly, according to the [US Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn87093403/)
, the weekly newspaper “Seattle Tribune” was founded in 1931 and it is not known exactly when in the last century it was shut down. Consequently, no data can be found on whether the portal with the same name, created later on, has anything to do with the original.

Secondly, since the site is first registered [on the 3rd of October, 2024](https://who.is/whois/seattle-tribune.com)
, a few days before the breaking news about Zelensky was published, it is very suspicious. There is no Impressum on the website, nor are there links to the journalists who write the news, the date the news was published or any other information about the portal itself. This is clear indication that this site impersonates a real news portal through which vectors of disinformation attacks are created, which is [a well-known tactic.](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)

It is also suspicious how the main source of this news is actually a screenshot from a channel on the Telegram platform, called [“Реальна Війна”](https://t.me/s/voynareal)
 or Real War (there is no link to the Telegram post).

**Photo: manipulated picture from Seattle Tribune, allegedly sourced from the Telegram group “Real War”** 

The picture itself, portraying the “Mercedes”, allegedly parked in front of the Presidential Palace of Ukraine, is obvious to be altered with at least two pictures.

One of the pictures, from the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, can be found on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/images/kiev-ukraine-august-04-2021-office-building-of-the-president-of-ukraine-city-of-kyiv/482821474?prev_url=detail)
 — a site for downloading photos for commercial use. The other, can be found on the [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/859132066386149502/)
 platform. The photo manipulation is done so that the photo of the car is superimposed over the other photo of the palace. The same reflections can be seen from the fenders of the “Mercedes” and the hood. Moreover, the picture shows the weather was sunny, or at least clear. Meanwhile, on the 6th of October, when this disinformation actually began to be spread, the weather forecast for Kyiv indicated [record rainfall.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-regions/3913586-u-kievi-6-zovtna-zafiksuvali-rekordnu-kilkist-opadiv.html)

#### **Inspiration behind the disinformation**  

As in all previous cases when Zelensky and his family members were the [target of disinformation](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)
, it was usually preceded by an important event that will wake up the Russian propagandists in order to distract attention elsewhere. More specifically, to undermine the trust not only of the citizens of Ukraine, but also of politicians and allies from the USA and the West who supply them with financial and military aid. And with that, prolong or block the help they are receiving, as was the case during the winter with the [US Congress.](https://vistinomer.mk/ruski-razorni-dezinformacii-ja-potpaluvaat-amerikanskata-politichka-scena/)

This time, the possible reason might be that one week before the website Seattle Tribune was created, Zelensky was in the United States. More specifically, on the 23rd of September he was in the state of [Pennsylvania](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/europe/ukraine-zelensky-pennsylvania-us-visit-intl-hnk/index.html)
, where he visited an ammunition factory, while a few days later, on the 26th of September, he presented his [“Victory Plan”](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240926-ukraine-will-prevail-joe-biden-tells-volodymyr-zelensky-after-pledging-8-billion-in-military-aid-to-kyiv)
 in the Oval Office in the White House.

On another note, six times just this year, Truthmeter.mk has fact-checked different disinformation surrounding the alleged luxuries of Zelensky, according to which, it turns out he has allegedly spent over one billion dollars intended as aid for the Ukrainian Army.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that BlackRock owns land in Ukraine. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policy on the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land. The evidence includes images of burials and discussions about land ownership, but it does not directly address the claim.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The evidence confirms that BlackRock owns land in Ukraine. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policy on the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence from Radio Free Asia ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) presents a claim that aligns with the original claim. It states that Western companies, potentially including BlackRock, are demanding that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on Ukrainian soil. The source attributes this claim to a Bulgarian politician and includes a Sputnik logo, which suggests the information might be biased.

The evidence does not directly confirm that BlackRock has made such a request, but it does provide a related claim from a potentially unreliable source.

The search results discuss land ownership in Ukraine. One source ([https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/](https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/)) includes a map of Ukraine with red squares indicating land leases <image:6658>.

A third source ([https://sofiaglobe.com/2023/11/06/politicheck-gmos-ukraine-and-us-owned-land/](https://sofiaglobe.com/2023/11/06/politicheck-gmos-ukraine-and-us-owned-land/)) also mentions BlackRock <image:6660>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Economist published an article on August 10, 2023, about Ukraine having to dig up victims of past wars to bury the dead, which includes an image of a burial (<image:6661>). The Myth Detector search result includes an image of a coffin draped with a Ukrainian flag, with text that translates to "Western owners demand to send the bodies of Ukrainian "heroes" for fertilizer" (<image:6662>). The image was published on October 5, 2023.

The New York Times published an article on June 19, 2023, about Ukrainian soldier funerals in Lviv (<image:6663>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that BlackRock owns land in Ukraine. However, the search results do not provide any information about BlackRock's policy on the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on its land. The evidence includes images of burials and discussions about land ownership, but it does not directly address the claim.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

It states that Western companies, potentially including BlackRock, are demanding that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on Ukrainian soil. The source attributes this claim to a Bulgarian politician and includes a Sputnik logo, which suggests the information might be biased.

The evidence does not directly confirm that BlackRock has made such a request, but it does provide a related claim from a potentially unreliable source.

Recovery operations at the site of a building hit in Russia's attack on July 8, 2024. (Interior Ministry / Telegram)

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)
, Ukraine's largest children's medical center, which Russia [directly targeted](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-struck-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-following-programmed-route-source-says/)
.

The Russian military struck the children's [hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/who-data-suggest-more-ukrainians-could-die-in-medical-site-attacks-in-2024/)
 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)
 (SBU), killing at least two people and injuring at least 50.

Russia launched [**another attack**](https://kyivindependent.com/latest-russian-attack-on-kyiv-hits-maternity-hospital-4-killed/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a Russian missile attack hit a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. The image in the claim (<image:8>) is associated with the aftermath of this attack. The presence of children's toys in the image could be interpreted as a sign of the hospital's function.

The claim states that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be determined with the available evidence. More information is needed to verify whether the toys were photoshopped.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The Kyiv Independent published an article on July 9, 2024, reporting on a Russian strike in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, showing rubble and emergency personnel. (<image:8>)

RBC-Ukraine discusses a Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, which hit the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital. The article mentions that 27 people, including 4 children, were killed and 117 were injured. The image <image:8> is present in the article, which was published on August 6.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine)) <image:4615> Reuters published an article about a Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a Russian missile attack hit a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. The image in the claim (<image:8>) is associated with the aftermath of this attack. The presence of children's toys in the image could be interpreted as a sign of the hospital's function.

The claim states that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be determined with the available evidence. More information is needed to verify whether the toys were photoshopped.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, the evidence does not contain any information about the alleged quote attributed to her.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim is uncertain due to the lack of evidence supporting the second part of the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The Associated Press also provides an image of Claudia Sheinbaum from [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sheinbaum-us-meeting-trump-g7-8f1265a5603f732ae2fd1778919304d1/) <image:6722>.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, the evidence does not contain any information about the alleged quote attributed to her.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim is uncertain due to the lack of evidence supporting the second part of the claim.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.

The Los Angeles Times article indicates that Wałęsa criticized Trump's actions. However, the evidence does not explicitly state the content of the letter, specifically whether it criticized the suspension of military aid to Ukraine.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was in a position to suspend military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The New York Times published an article on March 3, 2025, about Donald Trump and Ukraine military aid. Statista also published a chart showing a scenario of "No new U.S. aid" to Ukraine in 2025.

The claim can be considered plausible, as the evidence suggests that Trump could have suspended aid, and Wałęsa wrote a letter criticizing Trump's actions. However, the content of the letter is still unknown.

To fully verify the claim, the content of the letter needs to be examined.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on June 2, 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl)) mentions peace talks, but it does not confirm a deal.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms peace talks, not a finalized deal in early 2025.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl)) mentions peace talks, but it does not confirm a deal. The Atlantic Council discusses a potential "Putin-friendly peace deal" ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/a-putin-friendly-peace-deal-would-be-disastrous-for-global-security/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/a-putin-friendly-peace-deal-would-be-disastrous-for-global-security/)), implying that a deal was not yet finalized.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms peace talks, not a finalized deal in early 2025.


## Actions

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms peace talks in June 2025 but does not verify a peace deal in early 2025. The initial search and the subsequent search yielded no information to support the claim.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote attributed to her in the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a transcript or recording of a speech by Kamala Harris where she made the statement.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about Joe Biden greeting freed prisoners. The article includes an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac as a person exits the plane. <image:6819>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that on August 2, 2024, Joe Biden greeted a person exiting a plane. The image suggests that the plane was not empty when Biden approached it.

The claim states that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The evidence does not support this.

This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft."

## Actions
```
image_search("Joe Biden empty plane August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about Joe Biden greeting freed prisoners. The article includes an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac as a person exits the plane. <image:6819>


## Elaboration
The evidence shows that on August 2, 2024, Joe Biden greeted a person exiting a plane. The image suggests that the plane was not empty when Biden approached it.

The claim states that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The evidence does not support this.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden greeted a person exiting a plane, not that he boarded an empty plane. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. Le Monde reported that Biden pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims. The claim states that Biden announced no more aid for the affected areas.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "During his visit to the White House in April 2025 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria."

## Actions
```
image_search("Benjamin Netanyahu White House April 2025")
image_search("Benjamin Netanyahu Gaza Palestinians Ukraine Syria")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. One source from NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump)) shows an image of Netanyahu with Donald Trump <image:6857>. The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-april-7-2025/)) also provides an image of Netanyahu at the White House with Donald Trump <image:6858>.

Al-Monitor ([Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/06/netanyahu-visit-white-house-gaza-truce-pressure-mounts)) also contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House <image:6859>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Al Jazeera source ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/1/15/israel-has-declared-war-on-the-promise-of-a-strong-democratic-syria)) contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu <image:6865>. The BBC News website ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl2370ldxro)) includes an image of Benjamin Netanyahu pointing at a map of the Gaza Strip <image:6866>.

Le Monde ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/28/benjamin-netanyahu-s-new-war-against-northern-gaza-strip_6730858_4.html)) features an image of destruction in Gaza <image:6867>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House. However, the search results do not contain any information about Netanyahu announcing plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes a fact-check from Euronews, published on February 19, 2025, which states that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany over Russia-US peace talks. This directly contradicts the claim. The other search results provide images of Scholz and Trump, but do not provide any information to support the claim.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

### News Release

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

The search results include images of John Thune and Adam Schiff. One source from Yahoo News ([https://ca.news.yahoo.com/no-thune-didnt-block-schiff-161116916.html](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/no-thune-didnt-block-schiff-161116916.html)) shows an image of John Thune. <image:6980>

Another source from New Republic ([https://newrepublic.com/post/182717/watch-adam-schiff-reminds-republicans-just-guilty-trump](https://newrepublic.com/post/182717/watch-adam-schiff-reminds-republicans-just-guilty-trump)) contains an image of Adam Schiff. <image:6981>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of John Thune and Adam Schiff. However, the provided sources do not contain any information about John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

I still need more information to verify the claim, such as:
*   Statements from John Thune regarding Adam Schiff's committee assignments.
*   News articles or reports detailing the reasons behind any blocking of committee assignments.


## Actions
```
image_search("John Thune Adam Schiff committee assignments Russia investigation")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
I am unable to verify the claim. The search results provide images of John Thune and Adam Schiff, but no information about John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments due to his work in the Russia investigation.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide images of John Thune and Adam Schiff, but no information about John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments due to his work in the Russia investigation. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check could not verify the claim. While image searches yielded pictures of John Thune and Adam Schiff, no evidence was found to support the assertion that Thune blocked Schiff's committee assignments due to Schiff's past work on the Russia investigation.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The search results indicate that Pete Hegseth has made statements about Vladimir Putin being a war criminal, as reported by Newsweek. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim.

Since the evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim, and further verification is needed to confirm the statement, the most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the provided articles do not explicitly confirm the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search results mention destroyed tanks but do not specify the location or date. The image search results mention the Kursk region and the date August 2024, but the provided images do not match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the specific context of the image, including the location and the date.

This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:26> appears in articles discussing destroyed tanks in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, mentions Ukraine's loss of around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Defence Security Asia article from May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The articles do not mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, which includes an image of a Ukrainian tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of eliminating a Ukrainian unit in Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/](https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk), and [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the provided articles do not explicitly confirm the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search results mention destroyed tanks but do not specify the location or date. The image search results mention the Kursk region and the date August 2024, but the provided images do not match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the specific context of the image, including the location and the date.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:26> appears in articles discussing destroyed tanks in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, mentions Ukraine's loss of around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Defence Security Asia article from May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The articles do not mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, which includes an image of a Ukrainian tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of eliminating a Ukrainian unit in Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/](https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk), and [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the provided articles do not explicitly confirm the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search results mention destroyed tanks but do not specify the location or date. The image search results mention the Kursk region and the date August 2024, but the provided images do not match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the specific context of the image, including the location and the date.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:26> appears in articles discussing destroyed tanks in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, mentions Ukraine's loss of around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Defence Security Asia article from May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The articles do not mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, which includes an image of a Ukrainian tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of eliminating a Ukrainian unit in Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the provided articles do not explicitly confirm the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search results mention destroyed tanks but do not specify the location or date. The image search results mention the Kursk region and the date August 2024, but the provided images do not match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the specific context of the image, including the location and the date.

## Elaboration
The additional evidence confirms that images of destroyed tanks are associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. However, none of the provided sources specifically mention the Kursk Oblast, August 2024, or Ukrainian incursions. Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific supporting evidence.


## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim remains unverified. While the image search results confirm the existence of destroyed tanks in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, no evidence directly supports the claim that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results did not yield any matching images or articles that confirm the specific details of the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image shows destroyed tanks, and the search results confirm that destroyed tanks are associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results did not yield any matching images or articles that confirm the specific details of the claim.
