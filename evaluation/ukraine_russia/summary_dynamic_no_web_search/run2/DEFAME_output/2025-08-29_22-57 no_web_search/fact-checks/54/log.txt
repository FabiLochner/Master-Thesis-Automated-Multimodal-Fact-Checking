The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The investigation found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While reports indicate corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia), [https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)), the sources do not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

So, the overall veracity is: false
