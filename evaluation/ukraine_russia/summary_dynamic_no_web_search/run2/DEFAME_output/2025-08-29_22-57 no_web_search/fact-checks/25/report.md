The website united24media.com features an image of Nate Vance, a U.S. Marine veteran, fighting in Ukraine (![image 6734](media/2025-08-29_23-03-1756508635-892745.jpg)). CNN also provides an image of Nate Vance (![image 6735](media/2025-08-29_23-03-1756508636-203105.jpg)).

The South China Morning Post published an article about Nate Vance, the cousin of U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who is a former U.S. Marine (![image 6736](media/2025-08-29_23-03-1756508636-378913.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Nate Vance is the cousin of U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and a former U.S. Marine. The evidence also shows that Nate Vance is fighting in Ukraine. However, the evidence does not specify how long Nate Vance has been fighting in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that Nate Vance fought in Ukraine for three years cannot be verified with the provided evidence.
