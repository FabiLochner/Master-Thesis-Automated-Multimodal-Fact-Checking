The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a $35 million Florida home, $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, three private planes, and has a monthly income of $11 million cannot be verified. While image searches confirm Zelenskyy's association with a Florida home and planes, the provided evidence lacks specific details to substantiate the claim's figures regarding property, finances, and income.

So, the overall veracity is: false
