### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and planes.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. ![image 6773](media/2025-08-29_23-05-1756508705-334978.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Final Judgement
The search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. More information is needed to verify the claim.

The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of sufficient evidence. The search results provide some context, but they do not confirm the specific details mentioned in the claim, such as the exact number of homes, the value of the Florida property, the amount of money in an overseas account, or the monthly income. Therefore, the claim is considered unverified. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a $35 million Florida home, $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, three private planes, and has a monthly income of $11 million cannot be verified. While image searches confirm Zelenskyy's association with a Florida home and planes, the provided evidence lacks specific details to substantiate the claim's figures regarding property, finances, and income.
