The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there is evidence of Mark Rutte discussing Ukraine and images of him with Donald Trump, a search of multiple sources, including a Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/davos-nato-chief-rutte-reaffirms-need-step-up-support-ukraine-2025-01-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/davos-nato-chief-rutte-reaffirms-need-step-up-support-ukraine-2025-01-23/)), did not yield any evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Rutte.

So, the overall veracity is: false
