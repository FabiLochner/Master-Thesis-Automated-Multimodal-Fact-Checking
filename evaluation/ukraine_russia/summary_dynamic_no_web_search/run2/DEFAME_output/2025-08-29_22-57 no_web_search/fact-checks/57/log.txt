The claim 'In an interview with podcaster Theo Von in August 2024, Donald Trump criticized British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check revealed that while Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von, and there are articles discussing Trump and Keir Starmer, the search results do not provide any information about the content of the interview, specifically whether Trump criticized Keir Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
