### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows a Fox News broadcast from an Easter service where Kyiv was labeled as a Russian city. The Ukrainian media outlet "Suspіlne" reported that the broadcast showed "Kyiv, Russia" for over 20 minutes before correcting the error, which led to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanding an apology and investigation. The article from 444.hu also discusses the broadcast, which showed the Russian Orthodox Church ceremony with President Putin, followed by the Ukrainian ceremony. The article from Rijeka Danas also discusses the broadcast, which featured Vladimir Putin and Patriarch Kirill and referred to Kyiv as a "Russian city."
