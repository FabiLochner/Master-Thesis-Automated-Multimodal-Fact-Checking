## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukrainian MPs voted to ban the Russia-linked Orthodox Church in August 2024, as reported by Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/20/ukraine-mps-vote-to-ban-russia-linked-orthodox-church_6718913_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/20/ukraine-mps-vote-to-ban-russia-linked-orthodox-church_6718913_4.html)). The Vatican News also reported on Pope Francis's appeal for religious freedom in Ukraine in August 2024 ([https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-08/pope-francis-appeals-for-religious-freedom-in-ukraine.html](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-08/pope-francis-appeals-for-religious-freedom-in-ukraine.html)).

The evidence supports the claim that legislation was passed in August 2024. However, the exact nature of the legislation (i.e., whether it was a complete ban or something else) is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian MPs voted to ban the Russia-linked Orthodox Church in August 2024. While the exact details of the legislation are not fully described, the core claim about the action taken in August 2024 is supported by multiple sources.
