The claim 'French President Emmanuel Macron called Russian President Vladimir Putin a 'butcher' during his press conference with Donald Trump on Monday, Feb. 24, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump did hold a press conference on February 24, 2025, as evidenced by sources like [VPM.org/NPR News](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2025-02-24/trump-and-macron-meet-in-washington-as-europe-pleads-for-continued-help-with-ukraine) and [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-02-24-25?Date=20250224&Profile=cnnbrk), there is no supporting evidence to confirm that Macron referred to Vladimir Putin as a "butcher" during the event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
