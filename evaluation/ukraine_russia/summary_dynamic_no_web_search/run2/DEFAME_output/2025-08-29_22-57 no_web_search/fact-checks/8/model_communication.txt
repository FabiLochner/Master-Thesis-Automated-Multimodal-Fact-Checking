An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")
, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")
 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)
 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Tise-2)
 By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")
.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
[\[8\]](#cite_note-igo40-8)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")
, a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production")
 in Belgium by [SABCA](/wiki/SABCA "SABCA")
.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 In 1921 the [Air Ministry](/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry")
 ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport")
, and later by [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
, on services to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris")
 and [Brussels](/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")
.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")
 was introduced during the early 1920s.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20)
 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)
 while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](/wiki/Biplane "Biplane")
 with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle")
 engine.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23)
 For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34")
 biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Flight180823-24)
 A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway")
 ordered a batch of nine.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")
, [passenger terminals](/wiki/Airport_terminal "Airport terminal")
, [hangars](/wiki/Hangar "Hangar")
, [airmail](/wiki/Airmail "Airmail")
, and [radio navigation](/wiki/Radio_navigation "Radio navigation")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)
 [Pan Am](/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am")
 opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38")
 through [Sikorsky S-42](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42")
.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Johnson-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-racing_p265-32)
 British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the [de Havilland Dragon Rapide](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide "De Havilland Dragon Rapide")
, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)
 It was also used in military roles;[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 civil Dragon Rapides were [impressed](/wiki/Impressment "Impressment")
 into military service during the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")

The [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 appeared in 1935

Metal airliners came into service in the 1930s. In the United States, the [Boeing 247](/wiki/Boeing_247 "Boeing 247")
,[\[38\]](#cite_note-bhistory-38)
 and the 14-passenger [Douglas DC-2](/wiki/Douglas_DC-2 "Douglas DC-2")
,[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")
 and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[\[40\]](#cite_note-Mellberg-40)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")
, became the first commercial plane to circumnavigate the globe during December 1941 and January 1942.[\[44\]](#cite_note-Bull-44)

 but this project folded in 1951 as BOAC lost interest and the first aircraft needed a costly wing re-design to accommodate the [Bristol Proteus](/wiki/Bristol_Proteus "Bristol Proteus")
 engine.[\[50\]](#cite_note-Phipp67-50)

The Type II was split between the [de Havilland Dove](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dove "De Havilland Dove")
 and [Airspeed Ambassador](/wiki/Airspeed_Ambassador "Airspeed Ambassador")
 conventional piston designs,[\[51\]](#cite_note-Phipp75-51)
 and the [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 model powered by newly developed [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
: first flown in 1948, the [VC.2 Viceroy](/wiki/Vickers_Viscount "Vickers Viscount")
 was the first turboprop design to enter service;[\[52\]](#cite_note-Phipp81-52)
 a commercial success with 445 Viscounts built.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Andrews_and_Morgan,_p._537-53)
 The Type III requirement led to the conventional [Avro Tudor](/wiki/Avro_Tudor "Avro Tudor")
 and the more ambitious [Bristol Britannia](/wiki/Bristol_Britannia "Bristol Britannia")
, although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[\[54\]](#cite_note-Barnes347-54)
 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")
 turbojet engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. On 2 May 1952, the Comet took off on the world's first [jetliner](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
 flight carrying fare-paying passengers and simultaneously inaugurated scheduled service between London and Johannesburg.[\[56\]](#cite_note-bbc-56)
[\[57\]](#cite_note-cookman195207-57)
 However, roughly one year after introduction, three Comets broke up mid-flight due to airframe [metal fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(material) "Fatigue (material)")
, not well understood at the time.[\[58\]](#cite_note-withey_fatigue-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)
 The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[\[61\]](#cite_note-Phipp93-61)
[\[62\]](#cite_note-Jackson464-62)

By the 1960s, the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market, not regained by later designs like the [BAC 1-11](/wiki/BAC_1-11 "BAC 1-11")
, [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, and [Hawker Siddeley Trident](/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Trident "Hawker Siddeley Trident")
. The STAC committee was formed to consider [supersonic](/wiki/Supersonic "Supersonic")
 designs and worked with Bristol to create the [Bristol 223](/wiki/Bristol_223 "Bristol 223")
, a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner. The effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")

[United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 [DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
, Stapleton Airport, Denver, September 1966

The first batch of the [Douglas DC-4s](/wiki/Douglas_DC-4 "Douglas DC-4")
 went to the U.S. Army and Air Forces,\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] and was named the [C-54 Skymaster](/wiki/Douglas_C-54_Skymaster "Douglas C-54 Skymaster")
. Some ex-military DC-6s were later converted into airliners, with both passenger and cargo versions flooding the market shortly after the war's end. Douglas also developed a pressurized version of the DC-4, which it designated the [Douglas DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
. Rival company Lockheed produced the [Constellation](/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation "Lockheed Constellation")
, a triple-tailed aircraft with a wider fuselage than the DC-4.

The [Boeing 377 Stratocruiser](/wiki/Boeing_377_Stratocruiser "Boeing 377 Stratocruiser")
 was based on the [C-97 Stratofreighter](/wiki/Boeing_C-97_Stratofreighter "Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter")
 military transport, it had a double deck and a pressurized fuselage.

Convair produced the [Convair 240](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, a 40-person pressurized airplane; 566 examples flew. Convair later developed the [Convair 340](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers, of which 311 were produced. The firm also commenced work on the [Convair 37](/wiki/Convair_Model_37 "Convair Model 37")
, a relatively large double-deck airliner that would have served trans[continental](/wiki/Continent "Continent")
 routes; however, the project was abandoned due to a lack of customer demand and its high development costs.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

Rival planes include the [Martin 2-0-2](/wiki/Martin_2-0-2 "Martin 2-0-2")
 and [Martin 4-0-4](/wiki/Martin_4-0-4 "Martin 4-0-4")
, but the 2-0-2 had safety concerns and was unpressurized, while the 4-0-4 only sold around 100 units.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

During the postwar years, engines became much larger and more powerful, and safety features such as deicing, navigation, and weather information were added to the planes. American planes were allegedly more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

In 1936, the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers, leading to three [Latécoère 631s](/wiki/Lat%C3%A9co%C3%A8re_631 "Latécoère 631")
 introduced by [Air France](/wiki/Air_France "Air France")
 in July 1947.[\[65\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0114-65)
 However, two crashed and the third was removed from service over safety concerns. The [SNCASE Languedoc](/wiki/SNCASE_Languedoc "SNCASE Languedoc")
 was the first French post-war airliner.[\[66\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66)
 Accommodating up to 44 seats, 40 aircraft were completed for Air France between October 1945 and April 1948.[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

A [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")

The [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")
 was developed during the late 1950s as the first short range jet airliner. The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
, along with some fuselage elements.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 Entering service in mid 1959, 172 Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by 1963.[\[70\]](#cite_note-70)
 Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

The [Super-Caravelle](/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle "Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle")
 was a [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
 project of similar size and range to the Caravelle. It was merged with the similar [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
 project into the Anglo-French [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")
.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\
\]

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, [Lockheed L-1011](/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011")
, [Boeing 707](/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")
), air ambulance ([USAF](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")
/[USN](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")
 [McDonnell Douglas DC-9](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")
), [reconnaissance](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance")
 ([Embraer ERJ 145](/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family")
, [Saab 340](/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340")
, and [Boeing 737](/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")
), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")
.[\[75\]](#cite_note-75)

Since it began, the [jet airliner](/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner")
 market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)")
 going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel")
 till 2014 stimulating old jets replacement allowed by low [interest rates](/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate")
 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Manufacturer | 2016 orders and deliveries[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86) |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deliveries | values ($bn) | net orders | backlog |

| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")
, itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth")
 but also [supply and demand](/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand")
 balance and [oil prices](/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price")
, while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing")
 help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old : there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[\[87\]](#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87)
 Oil prices and [airshow](/wiki/Airshow "Airshow")
 orders are trending together.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

In 2020, deliveries were down by more than 50% compared to 2019 due to the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation](/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_aviation "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation")
, after 10 years of growth.[\[89\]](#cite_note-Flight23dec2020-89)

Cabin configurations and features

Main article: [Aircraft cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

Baggage holds

 front lower compartment. Note the rollers for [ULDs](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

**Have you ever traveled on a jumbo jet and wondered how people might have traveled by air before its invention?**

The Museum's collection holds a variety of different airplanes which help tell the story of flight. Our collection of commercial aircraft, such as the well-known Boeing 747, help tell the history of America by air. Learn more about some of these aircraft below. 

From the Wright Brothers to Today

The Airplane's Family Tree


------------------------------

Did you know that the parts of airplanes today can be traced directly back to the Wright Flyer and the work of Orville and Wilbur Wright? In this episode of STEM in 30, we trace the family tree of the airplane from that first flight on December 17, 1903, to today—all from inside a United Airlines 76.

Airplane Anatomy


--------------------

Help Wilbur and Orville assemble the 1903 Flyer and compare it to the parts of a modern airplane. While aviation technology has developed a lot since the Wrights time, not much about the basic components of an aircraft has changed!

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918.

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

[![View of red, U.S. Air Mail postage stamp that has an error of the Jenny biplane facing upside down.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14102h.jpg?itok=MBm-nefV)](/multimedia-gallery/14102hjpg)

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money.

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

First introduced in 1948, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop combined the power of jet propulsion with the efficiency of propellers. It was widely used in the first generation of turboprop-powered aircraft, including the British Vickers Viscount and the Dutch Fokker F-27. The Dart enabled these and other new airliners to lower airline operating costs and bring greater speed and comfort to passengers traveling on short-to-medium length routes.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999. 

[Look inside the Museum's 747](https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/v20170188004-panojpg)

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles).

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

    Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine
    
    Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area – a weapon described as a giant flamethrower.
    
    That is what a Russian security official told the state-run Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially.
    
    The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.
    
    Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.
    
    Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1 Solntsepyok (“Blazing Sun”) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment.
    
    TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six miles). The TOS-2’s manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis.

    It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, handed out awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service.
    
    “You’re risking your life for all of us and our state,” he said. “Thank you for defending Ukraine’s independence. Take care!”
    
    The visit was a demonstration of the country’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas area further east.
    
    An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and destruction.
    
    Hours after the president left, loud explosions were reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces there may have subsided, but it’s not entirely gone.

    Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House
    
    Ukraine’s capital is 1,540 years old this weekend, and you’d be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasn’t in the mood to celebrate.
    
    After all, it’s just over three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some predicting it would fall within 72 hours.
    
    At the time, I remember standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry.
    
    Today it's a different scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned last week; and you can’t help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket. Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter.
    
    !Kyiv <image:1637>
    
    “Life really goes on and we do not stop,” says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. “We hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alright”.
    
    Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. “I can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it won’t be the same” she admits.
    
    “I don’t have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.”
    
    For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022.

    !Volodymyr Zelensky visits Kharkiv <image:1640>Image source, Ukraine President's Office
    
    Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight.
    
    Now, he is compared to Winston Churchill.
    
    His steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as being a crucial factor in his country’s remarkable performance in the beginning of this war.
    
    His defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical middle finger to Russia and its president.
    
    While President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long table, his officials barely in shouting distance.
    
    As effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital. Today’s visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia’s invasion.
    
    He met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
    
    The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine’s second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never have been possible.
    
    But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to retreat in the Donbas.
    
    With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.

6.  !Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak <image:1642>Image source, Reuters
    
    Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said.
    
    "'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents," he wrote in a tweet.
    
    The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added.
    
    Allowing Russia to win would "open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."
    
    Podolyak went on to say: "Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations.
    
    "Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."

7.  !Kherson pictured on 20 May <image:1643>Image source, Getty Images
    
    Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia.
    
    Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall.
    
    Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head of [Kherson's Moscow-installed administration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61338617)
    , says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed.
    
    According to Reuters news agency, he says: "We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite is planned, but it won’t be today and it won’t be tomorrow because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson region."
    
    Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide.
    
    But the UK Ministry of Defence said, [in an intelligence update in April, external](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1518335593482268672)
    , a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine.
    
    And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating "pseudo-republics" throughout the country.
    
    He has advised people [not to give the Russian authorities any personal data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61188943)
    , such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes.

8.  More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv.
    
    He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts.
    
    It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians.
    
    Here are some more pictures of his visit.

9.  Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says.
    
    Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said.
    
    "I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state," the president told troops.
    
    The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

10.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations were not at the "expected level" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance.
    
    "For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which support terrorism entering Nato," the president said.
    
    Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance.
    
    Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria.

12.  As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    
    Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 "nationalists" \[Ukrainian soldiers\] have been killed.
    
    He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro.
    
    He says: "In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."

13.  The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents.
    
    Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area.
    
    Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces.
    
    The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema.
    
    But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back.
    
    Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to "squeeze out some result for itself".

    [What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902)
    , we’ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
    
    All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
    
    What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
    
    Where the [horrors of Bucha](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60981238)
     are dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
    
    In other words, none of this is ever Russia’s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
    
    This is the Kremlin narrative which we’ve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we’re hearing it again now.

16.  !The BBC's Clive Myrie with Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin <image:1653>
    
    As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain has [imposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659)
    , as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.
    
    Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: "She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position.
    
    "But she's very belligerent...
    
    "On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, \[but\] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe...
    
    "But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that?
    
    "To make Russia more feeble?"
    
    The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not "toppled down" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which has [seen inflation hit a 40-year high](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175)
    , partly driven by the Ukraine war.
    
    After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered.
    
    More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.

    The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it.
    
    It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains.
    
    But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas.
    
    The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory.
    
    So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room.

18.  Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.
    
    The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.
    
    The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.
    
    "The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
    
    "The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure," she said.
    
    The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 "and is by no means a result of the special military operation" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.
    
    The pandemic "has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services", she added.

    The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the Donbas region.
    
    Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself surrounded.
    
    Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.
    
    What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine.
    
    It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next.

    Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russia’s existence was threatened.
    
    The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a "fabrication".
    
    Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerous [eyewitness accounts from residents](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61003878)
    , who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.
    
    The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am.

Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops

!Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops <image:1659>

Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kiev, the presidential office says.

According to foreign media, Telegrafi reports, Zelensky visited the frontline positions in the Kharkiv region.

! <image:1660>

  

"I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our country", the president told the troops.

! <image:1661>

The northeastern city has seen some of the fiercest fighting since Russia launched its aggression in Ukraine on February 24.

! <image:1662>

His visit comes as Ukraine has begun receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and others from the US.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying that the supply of Harpoon missiles was the result of cooperation between several countries.

! <image:1663>

Ukraine has sought more sophisticated weapons, but so far most of the help has been in short-range systems, such as anti-tank weapons.

Meanwhile, the US is said to be considering a request from Ukraine to supply Kiev with heavier, longer-range weapons, but has yet to make a final decision. /**Telegraph**/

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows Zelensky in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the image is from Zelensky's visit to the front lines in the Kharkiv region. The BBC and Telegrafi.com articles ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803), [https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/)) confirm this.

The claim also mentions the Kursk Offensive, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence. The date of the image is not specified in the evidence, but the articles suggest it was taken during the ongoing conflict.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate because it misidentifies the location and the context of the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

One source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), contains no content.

Al Jazeera published an article on October 4, 2021, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offshore accounts (<image:6755>). NPR also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6756>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

One source from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338)) shows Zelenskyy. <image:6761> Another source from ABC News Australia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976)) also shows Zelenskyy near a plane. <image:6762>

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a Reuters article with an image of a building <image:6751> and a Yahoo article showing an oceanfront Florida mansion <image:6752>. One source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), contains no content.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 4, 2021, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offshore accounts (<image:6755>). NPR also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6756>).

The Council on Foreign Relations was also searched, but no content was found.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and planes. One source from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338)) shows Zelenskyy. <image:6761> Another source from ABC News Australia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976)) also shows Zelenskyy near a plane. <image:6762>

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim. The image searches show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes, but the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. More information is needed to verify the claim.

The search results include a Reuters article with an image of a building <image:6751> and a Yahoo article showing an oceanfront Florida mansion <image:6752>. One source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), contains no content.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 4, 2021, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offshore accounts (<image:6755>). NPR also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6756>).

The Council on Foreign Relations was also searched, but no content was found.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and planes. One source from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338)) shows Zelenskyy. <image:6761> Another source from ABC News Australia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976)) also shows Zelenskyy near a plane. <image:6762>

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

One source from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338)) shows Zelenskyy. <image:6761> Another source from ABC News Australia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976)) also shows Zelenskyy near a plane. <image:6762>

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57198736): 
Content: The BBC published an article that includes an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. <image:6791>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim. The image searches show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes, but the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim. The image searches show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes, but the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. More information is needed to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. More information is needed to verify the claim.

The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of sufficient evidence. The search results provide some context, but they do not confirm the specific details mentioned in the claim, such as the exact number of homes, the value of the Florida property, the amount of money in an overseas account, or the monthly income. Therefore, the claim is considered unverified. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a $35 million Florida home, $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, three private planes, and has a monthly income of $11 million cannot be verified. While image searches confirm Zelenskyy's association with a Florida home and planes, the provided evidence lacks specific details to substantiate the claim's figures regarding property, finances, and income.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check involved image searches related to Vladimir Putin, Dr. Anthony Fauci, extradition, and the war in Ukraine. The search results provided images of Putin, Fauci, and the war, but no evidence to support the claim that Putin sought Fauci's extradition in exchange for ending the war.

The decision option that best applies is `not enough information` because the fact-check did not find any evidence to support the claim. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence regarding Putin's alleged actions.

Another search result from Duke Health ([https://dhvi.duke.edu/news/experts-express-doubts-over-russias-vaccine-claim](https://dhvi.duke.edu/news/experts-express-doubts-over-russias-vaccine-claim)) contains an image of Vladimir Putin (<image:6318>).


## Elaboration
The search results provide images of both Vladimir Putin and Dr. Anthony Fauci. However, the evidence does not contain any information about Putin seeking Fauci's extradition or linking it to the war in Ukraine. The provided links discuss Fauci's doubts about the safety and effectiveness of Russia's COVID-19 vaccine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The articles contain images of Elon Musk (<image:6834>, <image:6836>) and a screenshot of an X post (<image:6835>).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about Elon Musk posting on X about suspending Volodymyr Zelenskyy's account in February 2025. The search results provide images of Elon Musk and a screenshot of an X post, but they do not confirm the claim.

I need to find the actual post from Elon Musk on X to verify the claim.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there is evidence of Annalena Baerbock being in the news and criticizing Trump's comments on Zelenskyy in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that she threatened the US with severing ties. The search results provide images of Baerbock and articles about her, but none of them mention the specific threat.

The most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reveals reports of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine. Specifically, there are reports of Ukrainian officials stealing funds meant for arms purchases ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) and a new phase of arms trafficking ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)).

While the evidence suggests corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html)) reports on a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption <image:6904>. Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) reports that Ukrainian officials stole $40 million meant to buy arms <image:6905>. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reports on a corruption scheme uncovered in Ukraine's defense sector <image:6906>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Global Initiative website ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)) discusses a new phase of arms trafficking in Ukraine <image:6910>. The Financial Times ([https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8](https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8)) contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers with a multiple rocket launcher <image:6912>.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ([https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html)) contains an image of weapons in crates <image:6915>.


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals reports of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine. Specifically, there are reports of Ukrainian officials stealing funds meant for arms purchases ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) and a new phase of arms trafficking ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)).

While the evidence suggests corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific evidence.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```
image_search("Ukraine arms sales US")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68136840](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68136840)) contains an image of tanks <image:6900>. The search result from Vox.com ([https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/2/4/24059340/us-arms-exports-2023-ukraine-war-russia-gaza](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/2/4/24059340/us-arms-exports-2023-ukraine-war-russia-gaza)) contains an image of a tank <image:6903>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence consists of images of tanks from BBC News and Vox.com. However, the search results do not contain any information about Ukraine selling armaments received from the United States.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to assess the claim's veracity.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html)) reports on a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption <image:6904>. Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) reports that Ukrainian officials stole $40 million meant to buy arms <image:6905>. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reports on a corruption scheme uncovered in Ukraine's defense sector <image:6906>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Global Initiative website ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)) discusses a new phase of arms trafficking in Ukraine <image:6910>. The Financial Times ([https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8](https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8)) contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers with a multiple rocket launcher <image:6912>.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ([https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html)) contains an image of weapons in crates <image:6915>.


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals reports of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine. Specifically, there are reports of Ukrainian officials stealing funds meant for arms purchases ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) and a new phase of arms trafficking ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)).

While the evidence suggests corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific evidence.


## Actions

The Guardian reports on a $322 million US arms sale to Ukraine, including an image of missiles <image:6919>. Defenseone.com contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers with a multiple rocket launcher <image:6920>. CNN reports on a Pentagon watchdog report regarding weaponry in Ukraine <image:6921>.


## Elaboration

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The Human Rights Watch published an article on July 24, 2025, about a new Ukrainian law that undermines the independence of anti-corruption bodies (<image:6945>).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.

Jagran Josh also discusses Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/joe-biden-net-worth-1673530564-1)). <image:6931> <image:6932> <image:6933>


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information on Mitch McConnell's net worth (<image:6936>). The Washington Post published an article about Mitch McConnell (<image:6937>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information about Nancy Pelosi's net worth. <image:6941> Forbes provides a profile of Nancy Pelosi. <image:6942>

The sources are: [https://www.investopedia.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth-8690668](https://www.investopedia.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth-8690668), [https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&year=2018](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&year=2018), and [https://www.forbes.com/profile/nancy-pelosi/](https://www.forbes.com/profile/nancy-pelosi/).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on June 16, 2023, about Ukraine battling corruption, including a photograph of Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy (<image:6943>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 28, 2023, about corruption in the US (<image:6944>). The Human Rights Watch published an article on July 24, 2025, about a new Ukrainian law that undermines the independence of anti-corruption bodies (<image:6945>).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.


## Actions

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The evidence provides information about the net worth of some of the politicians mentioned in the image but does not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine.

Content: The search result from CEPR discusses anti-corruption policies in the reconstruction of Ukraine. <image:6951>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a book cover titled "All the President's Money" by James Comer, which investigates foreign schemes that made the Biden family rich (<image:2356>). Al Jazeera published an article about Ukraine uncovering a defense sector corruption scheme (<image:2358>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim remains unverified. While the new evidence includes a book cover investigating the Biden family's finances and an article about corruption schemes in Ukraine, it does not validate the image's authenticity or the specific bribery allegations. The evidence does not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes taken by US politicians.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden."

## Actions

image_search("Mitch McConnell net worth")
image_search("Nancy Pelosi net worth")
image_search("US politicians Ukraine bribes")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Forbes published an article on August 28, 2019, discussing Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2019/08/28/joe-bidens-net-worth-how-the-2020-presidential-candidate-built-a-9-million-fortune/)). The New York Times also published an article about Joe Biden's net worth, mentioning his adjusted gross income ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/joe-biden-net-worth.html)). Jagran Josh also discusses Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/joe-biden-net-worth-1673530564-1)). <image:6931> <image:6932> <image:6933>


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information on Mitch McConnell's net worth (<image:6936>). The Washington Post published an article about Mitch McConnell (<image:6937>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information about Nancy Pelosi's net worth. <image:6941> Forbes provides a profile of Nancy Pelosi. <image:6942>

The sources are: [https://www.investopedia.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth-8690668](https://www.investopedia.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth-8690668), [https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&year=2018](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&year=2018), and [https://www.forbes.com/profile/nancy-pelosi/](https://www.forbes.com/profile/nancy-pelosi/).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on June 16, 2023, about Ukraine battling corruption, including a photograph of Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy (<image:6943>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 28, 2023, about corruption in the US (<image:6944>). The Human Rights Watch published an article on July 24, 2025, about a new Ukrainian law that undermines the independence of anti-corruption bodies (<image:6945>).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.


## Actions

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

An inlet check valve from the F-16 Fighting Falcon that crashed near March Air Reserve Base on May 16, 2019, is shown during the investigation into the crash. The U.S. Air Force concluded that the valve was improperly installed, leading to a leak of hydraulic fuel that rendered the pilot unable to control the aircraft. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:22>) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse in May 2019. The crash occurred near March Air Reserve Base due to improperly installed parts and hydraulic failure. The pilot ejected and survived. The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, and the missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)
.

Украинский журналист **Денис Казанский** опубликовал красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ «селфятся» на фоне лежащего на земле оккупанта.

«Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!», - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне убегали так быстро, что бросали тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, отмечает журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

‎Всего за несколько дней с начала контрнаступления украинской армии удалось освободить более 30 населенных пунктов Харьковской области, [объявил](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/3190)
 президент Украины Владимир Зеленский 9 сентября. На следующий день появились сообщения о том, что украинские войска вошли в Купянск, оккупированный российскими войсками в начале войны, об этом [рассказала](https://www.facebook.com/popova.natali/posts/pfbid0zaYm5vKnHk3gzPxJTwZeCWc2srUk9ksF517syxzGiC6UZEQA27TKxhSDtkXjHXkMl)

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».
