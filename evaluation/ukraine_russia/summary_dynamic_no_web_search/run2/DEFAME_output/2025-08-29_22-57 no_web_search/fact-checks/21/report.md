## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-mexican-president-refuses-to-visit-ukraine-calling-zelensky-a-drug-addict/): 
Content: Stopfake.org reports that a quote attributed to Claudia Sheinbaum, where she allegedly said "If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana," is fake. ![image 6726](media/2025-08-29_23-03-1756508608-732539.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the quote attributed to Claudia Sheinbaum is fake. Stopfake.org explicitly labels the quote as false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, the search results show that the quote attributed to her is fake. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
