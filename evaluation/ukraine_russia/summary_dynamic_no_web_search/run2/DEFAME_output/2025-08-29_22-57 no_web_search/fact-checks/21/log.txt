Content: Stopfake.org reports that a quote attributed to Claudia Sheinbaum, where she allegedly said "If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana," is fake. <image:6726>

The claim 'Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to Ukraine by Volodymr Zelenskyy and said towards him on September 17, 2024: 'If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Claudia Sheinbaum did decline an invitation to visit Ukraine, the quote attributed to her, "If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana," is fabricated, as reported by [Stopfake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-mexican-president-refuses-to-visit-ukraine-calling-zelensky-a-drug-addict/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
