The claim 'In February 2025 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened the US with severing ties amid US President Donald Trump's comments on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while there was a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, and Germany criticized Trump's comments, there is no evidence to support the claim that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened the US with severing ties in February 2025. The search results from sources like [PL English](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/) confirm the criticism but not the threat.

So, the overall veracity is: false
