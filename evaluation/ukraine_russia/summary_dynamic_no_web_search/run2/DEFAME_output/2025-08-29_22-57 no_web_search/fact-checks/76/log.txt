The claim 'While serving as US President in 2024, Joe Biden ordered the US forces to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that Joe Biden's nuclear strategy was a topic of discussion in 2024, with a focus on China, as reported by sources like The Guardian (<image:7008>) and Tasnim News (<image:7009>). However, the search results do not explicitly confirm that Biden ordered US forces to prepare for nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
