The claim 'BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim that BlackRock has requested that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on its land in Ukraine is not supported by direct evidence. While BlackRock does own land in Ukraine, and there are reports of burials, the search results did not provide any official statements or credible reports confirming the claim. A related claim from a potentially biased source, Radio Free Asia ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)), suggests that Western companies are making such demands, but this is not sufficient to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
