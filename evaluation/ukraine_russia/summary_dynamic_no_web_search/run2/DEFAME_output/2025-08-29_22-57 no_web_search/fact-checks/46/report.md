### Evidence from `image_search`
The Al Jazeera source ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/1/15/israel-has-declared-war-on-the-promise-of-a-strong-democratic-syria)) contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu ![image 6865](media/2025-08-29_23-08-1756508912-073056.jpg).

Le Monde ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/28/benjamin-netanyahu-s-new-war-against-northern-gaza-strip_6730858_4.html)) features an image of destruction in Gaza ![image 6867](media/2025-08-29_23-08-1756508912-825884.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House. However, the search results do not contain any information about Netanyahu announcing plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article with an image of Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump ![image 6873](media/2025-08-29_23-08-1756508931-109627.jpg) ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/5/trump-says-us-will-take-over-and-own-gaza-in-redevelopment-plan)). The Guardian reports that Israel has told its army to prepare a plan for Palestinians to voluntarily leave Gaza, including an image of destruction in Gaza ![image 6874](media/2025-08-29_23-08-1756508931-813446.jpg) ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/06/israel-tells-army-to-prepare-plan-for-palestinians-to-voluntarily-leave-gaza)).

The Human Rights Watch report includes an image of Palestinians displaced from Gaza ![image 6875](media/2025-08-29_23-08-1756508932-083355.jpg) ([Source](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza)).


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals that there have been discussions and plans related to the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. However, the evidence does not mention any specific plans to resettle Palestinians in Ukraine or Syria. The evidence does not confirm the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House and that there are discussions about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House and discussions about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza exist, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the available evidence.
