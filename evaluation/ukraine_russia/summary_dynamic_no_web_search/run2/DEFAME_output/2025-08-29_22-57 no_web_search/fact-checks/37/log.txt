Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about Joe Biden greeting freed prisoners. The article includes an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac as a person exits the plane. <image:6819>

The claim 'In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. An image from a New York Times article ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html)) shows Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac as a person exits the plane, not boarding an empty plane.

So, the overall veracity is: false
