The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image lists US politicians and alleged bribe amounts, there is no evidence to support the claim that it is an authentic list released by Ukraine. The search results provide information about the net worth of some of the politicians mentioned in the image and discuss corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

So, the overall veracity is: false
