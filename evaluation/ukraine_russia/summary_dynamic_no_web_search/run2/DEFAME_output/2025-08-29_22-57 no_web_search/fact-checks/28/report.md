## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The New York Times, Reuters, and Los Angeles Times all reported on this event. The Los Angeles Times article indicates that Wałęsa criticized Trump's actions. However, the evidence does not explicitly state the content of the letter, specifically whether it criticized the suspension of military aid to Ukraine.

To fully verify the claim, I need to examine the content of the letter.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
WHYY published an article about Trump pausing aid to Ukraine (![image 6775](media/2025-08-29_23-05-1756508709-342276.jpg)). Statista published a chart showing hypothetical scenarios of military and financial aid allocations to Ukraine in 2025, including a scenario of "No new U.S. aid" (![image 6776](media/2025-08-29_23-05-1756508709-774669.jpg)). The New York Times published an article on March 3, 2025, about Donald Trump and Ukraine military aid (![image 6777](media/2025-08-29_23-05-1756508710-092132.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was in a position to suspend military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The New York Times published an article on March 3, 2025, about Donald Trump and Ukraine military aid. Statista also published a chart showing a scenario of "No new U.S. aid" to Ukraine in 2025.

The claim can be considered plausible, as the evidence suggests that Trump could have suspended aid, and Wałęsa wrote a letter criticizing Trump's actions. However, the content of the letter is still unknown.

To fully verify the claim, the content of the letter needs to be examined.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025, and that Trump was in a position to suspend military aid to Ukraine. However, the content of the letter is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. `false`
