The claim 'In March 2025 former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing the U.S. President's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025, and that Trump was in a position to suspend military aid to Ukraine. However, the content of the letter is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
