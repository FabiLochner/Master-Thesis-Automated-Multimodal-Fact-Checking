The claim 'On Feb. 28, 2025, before a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Democrats.' is false.
Justification: The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump and with Democrats, but the dates of these meetings are not provided. Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy met with Democrats before meeting with Trump on February 28, 2025, cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
