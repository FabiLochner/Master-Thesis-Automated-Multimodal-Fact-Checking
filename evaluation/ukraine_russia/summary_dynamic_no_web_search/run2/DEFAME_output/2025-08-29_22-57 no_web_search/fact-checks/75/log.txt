The claim '<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. While the image shows individuals with American flag patches, and the image search provides context about the conflict, there is no evidence to confirm the presence of American mercenaries or their involvement in the specified military operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
