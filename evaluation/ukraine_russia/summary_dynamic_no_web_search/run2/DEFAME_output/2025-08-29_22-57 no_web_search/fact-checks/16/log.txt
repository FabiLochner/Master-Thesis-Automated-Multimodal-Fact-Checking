The claim 'In a press conference on December 9, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: 'I will ask Biden to invite me to NATO ... there's no point in talking to Trump.'' is false.
Justification: The fact-check did not find any evidence to support the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the specific statement in a press conference on December 9, 2024. Although images of Zelenskyy and Trump were found, and articles mentioned Zelenskyy's statements about Trump, the exact quote was not located in the search results. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
