Content: WHYY reports that Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania to thank workers and seek support for Ukraine. The article mentions that Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington. <image:13886>. The article does not contain any information about Zelenskyy campaigning for Kamala Harris.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with Kamala Harris, the visit's purpose was to thank workers and seek support for Ukraine, not to campaign for Harris, according to available sources like [WHYY](https://whyy.org/articles/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-visits-scranton-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
