## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington (![image 1007](media/2025-08-06_18-20-1754504425-007992.jpg)). A Wikipedia article discusses the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025, and mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" (<image:i>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a fact-check from aol.com, published on March 4, 2025, the claim that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the US is misleading. The article states that Baerbock said Germany would increase pressure on the US. The article includes a photo of Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), from February 23, 2025. ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html)) ![image 1022](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504527-815798.jpg), ![image 1023](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504528-288037.jpg)

An article from Izvestia, published on February 21, 2025, reports that Baerbock called for increased pressure on the U.S. regarding its stance on Ukraine and mentioned severing ties. ([https://en.iz.ru/en/1843130/2025-02-21/berbock-threatened-us-severing-ties](https://en.iz.ru/en/1843130/2025-02-21/berbock-threatened-us-severing-ties)) ![image 1048](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504540-201404.jpg) Press TV, published on February 22, 2025, reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump to prevent a US-Russia alliance, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine. The article also mentions Trump's criticism of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/22/743256/German-FM--Europeans-to-put-pressure-on-US,-keep-US-from-bilateral-relations-with-Russia](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/22/743256/German-FM--Europeans-to-put-pressure-on-US,-keep-US-from-bilateral-relations-with-Russia)) ![image 1049](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504545-769933.jpg), ![image 1050](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504546-657955.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. While a fact-check from aol.com states that the claim is misleading, an article from Izvestia reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. Press TV also reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump.

Therefore, the claim is **partially verified**.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Annalena Baerbock did express concerns about the US stance on Ukraine and called for increased pressure. While one source disputes the claim of severing ties, another source reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially verified. While a fact-check from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html)) disputes the claim that Baerbock threatened to sever ties, an article from Izvestia ([https://en.iz.ru/en/1843130/2025-02-21/berbock-threatened-us-severing-ties](https://en.iz.ru/en/1843130/2025-02-21/berbock-threatened-us-severing-ties)) reports that she did mention severing ties. Press TV also reported that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/22/743256/German-FM--Europeans-to-put-pressure-on-US,-keep-US-from-bilateral-relations-with-Russia](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/22/743256/German-FM--Europeans-to-put-pressure-on-US,-keep-US-from-bilateral-relations-with-Russia)).
