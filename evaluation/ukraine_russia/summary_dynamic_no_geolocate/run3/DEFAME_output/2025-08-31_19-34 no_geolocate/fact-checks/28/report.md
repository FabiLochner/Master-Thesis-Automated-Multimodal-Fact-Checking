## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the letter's existence and the criticism of Trump, but it does not verify the specific reason for the criticism mentioned in the claim.

To fully verify the claim, information about the letter's content regarding the suspension of military aid is needed.
