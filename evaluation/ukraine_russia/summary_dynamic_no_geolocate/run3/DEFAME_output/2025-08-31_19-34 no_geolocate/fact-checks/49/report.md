## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania, USA, on September 23, 2024. This information is found in articles from the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o), [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)).

The BBC articles were published on September 26, 2024, and the New York Post article was published on September 25, 2024. The New York Post article suggests that Zelensky's visit appeared to be a partisan political event. None of the sources mention Israeli bombs or Gaza. ![image 954](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504302-187821.jpg) ![image 960](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504308-548113.jpg) ![image 963](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504311-967303.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory. The video was shared online with the claim that the shells were destined for use in Gaza, but the factory produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. The video was published in September 2024, and Zelenskyy's handwritten messages on the shells reference Ukraine's war with Russia. Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania and signed some of the shells. (![image 16](media/49.jpg))

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania, USA, not Israeli bombs. The shells are intended for use by the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory in Pennsylvania, not Israeli bombs. The shells are intended for Ukraine's defense, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania, USA, as confirmed by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)). The shells are for Ukraine's defense, not Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza, as stated by Eurovision News ([https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy)).
