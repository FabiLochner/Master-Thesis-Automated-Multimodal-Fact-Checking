The article mentions that this theory was promoted by Russian intelligence and spread by various individuals and media outlets, including Peter Schweizer, John Solomon, and Fox News, as part of efforts to damage Joe Biden's reputation.

The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.

Additionally, the BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217)) and Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory)) confirm that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden.
