Content: The Hindustan Times published an article on December 14, 2024, about a drone crashing into a New Jersey homeowner's backyard. <image:1>. The article mentions the Pequannock Police Department and the mayor of Pequannock, Ryan Herd.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/mystery-drone-crash-new-jersey-social-media-video-1997497): 
Content: Newsweek reports on mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey, with the FBI and local police investigating. An unverified video allegedly shows a drone crash. Eyewitnesses describe the drones as larger than hobbyist drones. The FAA has temporarily banned drones from flying over a military base and Trump's golf club in response to the sightings. <image:13618>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. While evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down U.S. drones in 2025, the provided evidence does not verify that the image depicts a U.S. drone shot down in March 2025 or that Russian missiles were used. Additionally, the location of the crash site in the image remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
