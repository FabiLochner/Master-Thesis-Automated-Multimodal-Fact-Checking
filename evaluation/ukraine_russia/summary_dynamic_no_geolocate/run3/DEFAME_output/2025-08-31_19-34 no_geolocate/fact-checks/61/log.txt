Useful result: From [Source](https://bronx.com/putins-limo-blows-up-days-after-zelenskyy-said-he-would-die-soon/): 
Content: The Bronx.com reports that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines caught fire near Moscow's FSB headquarters on March 29, 2025. The article mentions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Putin "will die soon" days before the incident. The article does not mention Putin's health status after the explosion. <image:13952>

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while there was an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, as reported by sources like the [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms) and the [Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868), there is no evidence to support the claim that he died in the explosion. The available information does not confirm Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
