## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova. The article mentions that wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7. ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)) ![image 4830](media/2025-08-23_13-03-1755954217-459667.jpg), ![image 4831](media/2025-08-23_13-03-1755954217-727789.jpg)

The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims. Vladimir Saldo offered to accept Americans who lost their homes in the California fires, but only those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022.

An NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires. The article states that Russian news sites are spreading false or unverified narratives about the California fires. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) ![image 4849](media/2025-08-23_13-04-1755954245-538762.jpg), ![image 4853](media/2025-08-23_13-04-1755954253-415153.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. Instead, one article mentions that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims under specific conditions ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)). Another article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)).

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention any offers of assistance.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025, with some reports discussing offers of sanctuary to fire victims. However, there is no evidence of Russia offering assistance for the wildfires.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. Instead, reports indicate offers of sanctuary to fire victims under specific conditions ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)) and the spread of false narratives by Russian news sites ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)).
