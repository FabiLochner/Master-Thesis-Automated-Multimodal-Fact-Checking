Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us): 
Content: Euronews published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that Mark Rutte, NATO's Secretary-General, did not threaten to expel the US from the alliance if Donald Trump surrendered Ukraine to Putin. The article mentions that there is no evidence of Rutte making such a statement and that NATO does not have a mechanism to expel a member. The article also includes Rutte's statements about working closely with Trump and his comments on the importance of the US within NATO.

The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/did-nato-chief-vow-kick-us-out-over-trumps-ukraine-plan-what-we-know-mark-rutte-1983779) and [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us), state that Mark Rutte did not make the alleged statement, and NATO has no mechanism to expel a member.

So, the overall veracity is: false
