Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2024/hany-farid-debunks-claims-ukraine-hospital-bombing-images-are-manipulated): 
Content: The search result from the University of California-Berkeley, published on August 1, 2024, discusses claims that images of the Okhmatdyt pediatric hospital bombing in Kyiv were manipulated. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert, stated that the photo shows "no evidence of digital manipulation or editing." The article references a post from July 10, 2024, by Jackson Hinkle, which highlighted a football and red toy truck in the image. <image:8>

Useful result: From [Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/bombed-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-is-an-actor/): 
Content: Myth Detector published on July 24, 2024, an article about a video that allegedly shows a doctor in the bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv is an actor. The article states that the video is fabricated and created to discredit Ukraine. The article also mentions that the attack on the children’s hospital was confirmed by international organizations. <image:13814>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-ukraine-did-not-bomb-a-hospital-in-kyiv/a-69608363): 
Content: DW fact-checked the claim that Ukraine bombed a children's hospital in Kyiv and found it to be false. The article states that the hospital was hit by a Russian-made Kh-101 cruise missile. The article also mentions that Russia denied responsibility for the attack and attempted to shift the blame to Ukraine. The article includes images of the attack and mentions that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has posted pictures from the site of the attack. The article also mentions that several social media posts have surfaced, claiming it was not Russia, but Ukraine that bombed the children's hospital. The article was edited by Rachel Baig.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image shows photoshopped toys is false. While a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024, a digital forensics expert found no evidence of manipulation in the image in question, as reported by the University of California-Berkeley ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-5033075/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-childrens-hospital-kyiv](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-5033075/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-childrens-hospital-kyiv)).
