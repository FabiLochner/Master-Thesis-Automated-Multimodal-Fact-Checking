## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, also known as the Securing Our Future London Summit, took place on March 2, 2025, in London, hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The summit aimed to create a "coalition of the willing" in Europe to present a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. Outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including Â£1.6 billion in UK export finances for air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit also aimed to build strong security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure a lasting ceasefire or peace deal. Articles from Le Monde and Reuters also covered the summit, with the former mentioning a peace plan and the latter reporting on Russian parliamentarians dismissing the summit. ![image 3110](media/2025-08-22_08-57-1755853049-462977.jpg) ![image 3111](media/2025-08-22_08-57-1755853060-375624.jpg)

ABC News ([Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-set-european-summit-london-after-trump-showdown/story?id=119338966)) also reports on the European summit in London with Zelenskyy.
