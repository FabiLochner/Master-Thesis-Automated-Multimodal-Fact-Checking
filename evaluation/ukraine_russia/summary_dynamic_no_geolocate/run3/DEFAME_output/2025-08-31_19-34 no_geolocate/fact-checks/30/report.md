## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, including a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025 (![image 4898](media/2025-08-28_15-35-1756395339-850858.jpg)). CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg)).

Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mentioning a timeline of the war up to December 2024 and a The Guardian article that mentions Trump reportedly backing the ceding of Ukrainian territory to Russia as part of a peace deal. The Wikipedia article also mentions a 2025 Putin-Trump call.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace talks and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian and CNN articles from August 2025, along with the Wikipedia entry, indicate discussions and meetings related to a potential peace deal. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

The evidence mentions a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, and a Putin-Trump call in 2025, which implies that negotiations were in progress. The articles also discuss the complexities of reaching a peace deal, including the difference between a ceasefire and a peace agreement.

Therefore, while the evidence confirms that peace talks were happening in 2025, it does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/russia-says-ukraine-not-interested-in-long-term-peace): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Russia said Ukraine was "not interested" in a long-term peace deal. The article mentions that Trump is trying to end the war through talks with Zelenskyy and Putin. <image:0>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace talks were ongoing in 2025, but there is no evidence to support the claim that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. The Al Jazeera article from August 21, 2025, indicates that Russia and Ukraine were still negotiating, and Russia claimed Ukraine was not interested in a long-term peace deal.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that peace talks were ongoing in 2025, but there is no evidence to support the claim that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. The Al Jazeera article from August 21, 2025, indicates that Russia and Ukraine were still negotiating, and Russia claimed Ukraine was not interested in a long-term peace deal.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Based on the evidence, including articles from The Guardian, CNN, and Al Jazeera, peace talks between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025, with discussions involving figures like Trump, Zelenskyy, and Putin. However, the available information does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. In fact, an Al Jazeera article from August 2025 suggests that negotiations were still in progress, and Russia claimed Ukraine was not interested in a long-term peace deal.
