## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that President Biden made remarks regarding Hurricane Helene on September 30, 2024, not September 29, 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene and that his administration would continue working with local and state leaders. The evidence does not mention any announcement about withholding aid for the affected areas or providing additional aid to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence contradicts the claim by showing that Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene.

To fully verify the claim, information about Biden's statements on aid allocation for Hurricane Helene and Ukraine on September 29, 2024, would be needed.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that President Biden made remarks about Hurricane Helene on September 30, 2024, not September 29, 2024, as stated in the claim. The evidence indicates that Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene and does not mention any announcement about withholding aid for the affected areas or providing additional aid to Ukraine.

The claim is not factually accurate because the date is incorrect, and the evidence contradicts the claim by showing that Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is inaccurate. While President Biden did make remarks regarding Hurricane Helene, the date provided in the claim is incorrect, and the available evidence from sources like [France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118) and [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html) indicates he pledged aid to the victims, contradicting the claim's assertion about withholding aid.
