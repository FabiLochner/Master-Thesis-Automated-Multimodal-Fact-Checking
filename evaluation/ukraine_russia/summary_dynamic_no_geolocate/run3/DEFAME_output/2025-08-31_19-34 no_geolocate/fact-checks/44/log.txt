Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fema-chief-calls-false-claims-about-governments-helene-response-truly-dangerous): 
Content: The PBS NewsHour published an article on October 6, 2024, discussing false claims about the federal response to Hurricane Helene. The article mentions that President Joe Biden said his administration "will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders." The article also includes a White House press briefing image <image:13900>.

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is inaccurate. While President Biden did make remarks regarding Hurricane Helene, the date provided in the claim is incorrect, and the available evidence from sources like [France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118) and [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html) indicates he pledged aid to the victims, contradicting the claim's assertion about withholding aid.

So, the overall veracity is: false
