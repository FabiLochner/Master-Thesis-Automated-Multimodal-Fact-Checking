The Guardian published an article with a transcript of the meeting between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and JD Vance ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript)).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a White House meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including a phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy on July 25, 2019, and the withholding of military aid. The Guardian published an article on March 4, 2025, discussing the US suspension of military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting where Trump expressed frustration with Zelenskyy and threatened to cut off aid, also mentioning JD Vance. NPR also published an article on March 4, 2025, stating that the Trump administration paused U.S. aid to Ukraine after a "disastrous meeting" between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ![image 15](media/48.jpg)
