The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. The image is a meme, and while there is evidence of aircraft damage during the Russo-Ukrainian War, the specific claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia cannot be verified due to the image's nature and lack of specific details. The evidence includes reports of Ukrainian forces damaging Russian aircraft using drones ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/29/world/ukraine-blows-up-russian-bridges-own-mines-cheap-drones-intl), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/ukraine-claims-to-have-damaged-russian-fighter-jets-in-night-time-raid)) and the loss of an F-16 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation_shootdowns_and_accidents_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
