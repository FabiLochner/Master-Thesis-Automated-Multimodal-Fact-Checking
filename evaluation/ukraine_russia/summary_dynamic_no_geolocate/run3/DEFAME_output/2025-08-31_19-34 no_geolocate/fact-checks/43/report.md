## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, mentioning allegations of investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and Trump withholding aid to Ukraine ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)).

Newsweek and the Associated Press fact-checked the claim, stating that it originated from social media and was promoted by right-leaning commentators and Russian influencers. The Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that funds were laundered from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S. ([https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774), [https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380)). The AP's assessment is false. ![image 2147](media/2025-08-07_20-01-1754596899-160228.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Fact-checkers from Newsweek and the Associated Press have debunked the claim, stating that it originated on social media and lacks supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim that half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources, including Newsweek and the Associated Press, have investigated the claim and found no evidence to support it. The claim appears to have originated on social media and was promoted by right-leaning commentators and Russian influencers.
