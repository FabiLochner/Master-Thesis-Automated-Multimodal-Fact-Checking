Between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/): 
Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The report highlights concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains. The report suggests that arms trafficking is likely to be multifaceted, involving small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors. <image:1112>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/): 
Content: Statista, in cooperation with SIPRI, published a report in March 2025, detailing arms exports from Ukraine by country from 2018 to 2024. The report shows that China, Saudi Arabia, and India were among the main importers of Ukrainian arms. <image:13121> <image:13122> <image:13123>. The report does not mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales): 
Content: Trading Economics reports that Ukraine's weapons sales decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024, with an average of 388.15 SIPRI TIV Million from 1992 to 2024. The source is SIPRI.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The available evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier, and there are reports of corruption and arms trafficking, there is no data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine, nor does it specify the origin of the arms being sold. Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
