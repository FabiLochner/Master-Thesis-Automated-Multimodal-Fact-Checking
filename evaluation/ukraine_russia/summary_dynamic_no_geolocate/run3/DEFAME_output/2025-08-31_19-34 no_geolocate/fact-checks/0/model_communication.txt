On March 16, a cover of the British daily newspaper Hull Daily Mail was actively shared on Russian- and [Georgian-language](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0g1GfY7Z4aGG2xGcbGWwFUMDyp5zv6Kn2tu9X8RujD2idboESUuMpueFeNq52AMPMl&id=100003712160160)

) The image features the following caption: “_70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain.”_ According to the date shown on the image, this issue was supposedly published on March 13, 2025. Additionally, no such visual appears on the publication’s official [website](https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/)
 or social media pages [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hulllive/)
, [Instagram,](https://www.instagram.com/hulllive)

).

The actual [cover](https://www.pressreader.com/newspapers/n/hull-daily-mail/20250313)
 of the March 13 issue does not mention Ukraine at all, while the main headline of the issue reads: “Boy found guilty of attempting to murder a girl with a sword.”

The newspaper did not use such a cover on March 13 or any other day.**

After Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed that Sudzha in Kursk Oblast isn’t [under](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid02aCgbPoHJE6tdu89hW2W8oSECghBdQcpvDqcTD7rnyxThUkwmGN5kDQPF53vPLgEYl)
 the Armed Forces’ control and thanked Ukrainian troops for Kursk operation, the information about a new cover for British _Hull Daily Mail_ spread online. 

The сover for the new issue — extensively discussed on Telegram — had a headline saying almost 70 thousand (**UPD**: 70,000, not 200,000) Ukrainian soldiers died in Russia’s Kursk region. It is a fake cover.

What happened?
--------------

Since March 15, 2025, this cover has been published on Telegram channels that regularly spread Russian propaganda, e.g., Ramzai (“Рамзай”, [archive](https://archive.ph/lbZQC)
), Tsarhrad TV (Царьград ТВ, [archive](https://archive.ph/kFuzl)
), V Рука Кремля Z ([archive](https://archive.ph/S6ojC)
), web-resources like Russian spring (Русская весна, [archive](https://archive.ph/vGRJh)
), Politikus (“Політікус,” [archive](https://archive.ph/evraz)
), and on X accounts ([1](https://archive.ph/Oq0sF)
,[2](https://archive.ph/TEjv8)
,[3](https://archive.ph/Fj0XG)
). 

The posts included a cover of the British regional daily newspaper of _Hull Daily Mail_ with the following text: 

!Telegram posts and other pro-Russian sources posting fake Hull Daily Mail cover about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers dying in Kursk  <image:1452>

Telegram posts and other pro-Russian sources posting fake Hull Daily Mail cover about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers dying in Kursk

“70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk Oblast died in vain. The victim managed to survive, so the defendant was found guilty of the attempted murder. 

So, the “news” about British outlet _Hull Daily Mail_ writing about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers dying in Russia’s Kursk region is another fake, aimed at the accreditation of allied countries providing Ukraine with aid among Russian-speaking audiences. 

Conclusion: Fake

A WIDELY CIRCULATED image of a UK local newspaper front page containing the headline “70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain” is fake.

The supposed front page of the Hull Daily Mail – a local newspaper in England – from Thursday, 13 March was shared widely across social media by multiple accounts.

[Multiple examples](https://www.facebook.com/okoro.austine.1/posts/pfbid0CP3sHF7i9DmTrMjun8LADctWJoPfACeJ3b9DbeLMNfn28vJTYL6orp2p8XQ7UE5il)

 containing the doctored image can be found on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TinhCaTayBac1979/posts/pfbid0854v3LXb6u4gqFi229CbiPTjwqbtSX3UTXaR2LSGqjKea4biRFL8H7cyLxr1CecVl)
 and [X](https://x.com/DD_Geopolitics/status/1900999961350901999)
, where they have been liked and shared thousands of times. The posts have been shared by figures with links to Russia and who have previously spread disinformation.

The image beneath the fake headline shows one soldier comforting another, with a sub-headline saying: “The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky’s crushing failure”.

The fake headline references recent battles in the Kursk region of Russia as part of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine launched an offensive into the Kursk region last year in retaliation for an invasion that has seen Russian troops occupy swathes of southern and eastern Ukraine.

However, Ukrainian forces have recently come under intense pressure from Russian forces there, and there have been many reports of soldiers having to retreat from the region.

But the Hull Daily Mail headline describing the conflict in Kursk is fake. 

“That story re Ukraine was a fake,” Lija Kresowaty, a spokesperson for Reach PLC, the Hull Daily Mail’s parent company, [told AFP News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fake-newspaper-cover-ukrainian-soldiers-180125785.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAVEWlsU32-KZuLxBFOD9WpKhOeQNx4Q7ZCMt2Oci-U2kfjiYWf0WdSLBOwmdFhk7qKgCcdyqUViu3und3fjSmLvm3XeH6ZLYDaVcp3wr35Nzao2wcRRZiqX_AgkT7MqwPM3VHIb3ORXTiyNH1CnF0dSNHy8PZS45d87r-DeSxBJ)
.

[A copy of the front page from 13 March](https://penrithcity.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/ISSENQ?SETLVL=&ISX=142144)
, held by the Penrith City Library, shows a different front page from the one circulated, as does the Press Reader website (which features archives of dozens of regional and national newspapers).

“Boy found guilty of attempting to murder girl with a sword,” the front-page text reads in the real edition of the Hull Daily Mail from that date.

It describes a Halloween camping in which a young teenager is alleged to have been stabbed ten times.

It is unclear where the 70,000 figure used in the fake post about Ukraine came from. <image:1472>](https://www.thejournal.ie/author/cormac-fitzgerald/3970/)

From [Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/): 
Content: "The supposed magazine cover is a fake.

AAP FACTCHECK – A fake cover of The Economist magazine depicting Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin against an apocalyptic background has been shared on social media and pushed by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel.

The faked image depicts US president-elect Trump and Russian President Putin in a face-to-face confrontation with missiles between them and the headline "APOCALYPSE".

The cover has turned up in [Facebook posts](https://mvau.lt/media/37ed0fb6-4352-4ad3-bc3a-25c86409fe78)
, in [X posts](https://mvau.lt/media/ac7986a3-4a4f-43f5-b479-8f1f205e5609)
 and on [Instagram](https://mvau.lt/media/fba74436-064c-4cad-8077-c56a8192eabc)
. 

The image bears The Economist's standard masthead and is accompanied by comments such as "...is Trump afraid to see how Biden's gang is starting a nuclear war?"

However, there are telltale signs the cover is fake. (Facebook/AAP)

*   "America pumbed-up economy" should read "America's pumped-up economy"
*   "Times up for TikTok" is missing the apostrophe in "Time's"
*   "industry" is missing an r in "A special report on oil industy"
*   "Biden left the White House" is untrue as Joe Biden is still the serving president.

Most of these cover lines appear, correctly spelled, on a genuine Economist cover from March 16, while the genuine February 24 cover featured Mr Putin and Mr Trump, in a different stance, with the headline "IS EUROPE READY?".

Fake Economist 'Apocalypse' cover linked to pro-Kremlin propaganda
==================================================================

David Williams November 28, 2024

!AAP FactCheck Feature Image Update 18 v3 <image:13761>

The supposed Economist magazine cover is fairly convincing, but it is a fake. Its leaders must urgently jettison their post-Soviet complacency and act before it is too late [https://t.co/qhmYsjLVTL](https://t.co/qhmYsjLVTL)
>  [pic.twitter.com/wPCoFUYk0A](https://t.co/wPCoFUYk0A)
> 
> — The Economist (@TheEconomist) [February 22, 2024](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1760668341201461756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 covers archive does not include the fake cover and it doesn't appear anywhere else on the popular magazine's website.

AAP FactCheck contacted The Economist but did not receive a response before publication.

The fake cover has been shared as tensions heighten between Russia and the West over the US decision to allow Ukraine to use American long-range missiles against Russia.

Russia's response, a hypersonic missile launched against Ukraine on [November 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFBGwsXxSTQ)
, was reportedly a message to the West to ["back off"](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-sends-missile-message-west-back-off-2024-11-22/)
 if they want to avoid a missile strike against US and British targets.

Social media posts sharing the fake Economist cover promote the message that Putin does not want nuclear war, and that reports of a bomb – or World War III – are emanating from "the Cabal" (the West).

The fake cover has echoes of a similar fake in [June 2024](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/economist-did-not-publish-cover-warning-inevitable-nuclear-war-2024-06-14/)
, which depicted Mr Putin and President Joe Biden head to head over a chess game. 

[NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/fake-economist-cover-used-by-russia?open=false#%C2%A7pro-kremlin-sources-cite-fake-economist-cover-story-to-fearmonger-world-war-iii)
 has linked the most recent cover to pro-Kremlin sources, who it says have been pushing the fake image to warn that US and NATO support of Ukraine, particularly the recent missile decision, have brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

!Debris of the US-made long-range ATACMS missile <image:13763> US-made long-range missiles were shot down in Russia's Kursk region. Image by Facebook/AAP

WHAT WAS CLAIMED

The Economist cover foreshadows apocalyptic conflict between the US and Russia.

OUR VERDICT

False. There is no publication date and spelling mistakes and errors appear in the cover lines (top right corner):

!Close-up of errors in fake Economist cover <image:13762> Several obvious errors in wording on the fake cover give away that it's a fake. (EPA PHOTO)

It cites Telegram channel @GolosMordora, which is affiliated with Russian intelligence services, as pushing the claim.

The fake cover was published [on Telegram](https://perma.cc/D4KR-L6XX)
 on November 18. 

Telegram translates the post into English as: "'Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the beginning of World War III,' warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.

"Experts have long suspected that the authors are backed by the global elite – they have predicted all the epochal events since 1983 with frightening accuracy. This was the case with the COVID-19 epidemic, the NWO and the conflict in the Middle East.

"In the warning for December-January: what radical measures will Russia take in response, which countries will intervene in the conflict and who will be the first to use nuclear weapons – read the analysis if you are not afraid to find out the truth."

The post ends with a link to a fake Economist Telegram account.

The Verdict

False – The claim is inaccurate.

Some Russian media outlets promoting the fake cover have cited a Telegram channel called "The Economist," which is not affiliated with the British magazine. It includes the sensational caption "Apocalypse."

According to these propagandists, the issue's supposed theme is that Western approval for Ukraine's long-range strikes deep into Russian territory marks "the beginning of World War III."

 2024 did feature a different illustration of President Putin and Mr Trump with the title ‘Is Europe ready?’

The image of the fake Economist cover was shared in [a Telegram post](https://t.me/golosmordora/42580)
 on 19 November which now has over 40,000 views. Apparently, this is what they are going to leave Trump as an inheritance.” Mr Trump will be [inaugurated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde7ng85jwgo)
 and become US President for the second time on 20 January 2025.

However, this is not a genuine cover of The Economist. <image:13790>Edinburgh Live

Full Fact has contacted The Economist for comment on the fake cover, and will update this article if we receive a response.

This is not the first time an image has been falsely presented as a cover of The Economist—a cartoon depicting US President Joe Biden and President Putin playing chess with a title warning of an “inevitable” nuclear war was [debunked by fact checkers at Reuters in June](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/economist-did-not-publish-cover-warning-inevitable-nuclear-war-2024-06-14/)
. The layout resembles other [recent covers](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 for The Economist with the publication’s masthead in the top left corner alongside a list of articles in the edition on the right.

 have shared the image with the caption: “‘The Economist’ warms up the audience with apocalyptic images. It has not been shared on the publication’s [archive of past editions](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
, or elsewhere on its website.

There are other telltale signs that this is not a genuine cover. But this is not a genuine cover.

The image features illustrations of the two politicians facing each other with missiles in the background. The caption says in Russian (translated by Google): “Permission to launch missile strikes deep into Russia is the beginning of the Third World War, warns the prophetic magazine The Economist”.

It adds: “In the warning for December-January: what kind of radical measures will Russia take in response, which countries will intervene in the conflict and who will be the first to use nuclear weapons”.

This caption seems to refer to [the US](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c789x0y91vvo)
 granting permission for Ukraine to fire long-range missiles at targets within Russia and [reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g704g051go)

The image of The Economist cover featuring Trump and Putin with the "APOCALYPSE" headline is a fake, according to fact-checkers like AAP FactCheck ([Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/)), Ukrinform.net ([Source](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html)), and Yahoo News ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/economist-not-published-apocalypse-cover-154559076.html)). These sources identify the cover as a fabrication, potentially linked to pro-Kremlin propaganda and containing spelling errors.

CNN  — 

Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.

But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.

There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.

China has always claimed neutrality in [Russia’s war on Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. They had been fighting for only three days.

The role of foreign fighters
----------------------------

Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.

A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.

In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.

A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.

“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.

Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.

Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.

“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. [](#maincontent)

CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.

The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”

But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.

![A man rides his bicycle past the building of the Chinese embassy in Kyiv on April 8, 2025.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2208587347.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.

One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.

It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.

It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.

Why the timing matters
----------------------

Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.

The timing is important.

It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.

Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.

From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.

But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.

Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.

“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.

“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.

Beijing certainly saw it like that.

“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.

Ad Feedback One of the men recounted the chaotic moments that lead up to their capture in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.

“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”

The men surrendered. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.

As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.

Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood."

Moscow stages largest Victory Day parade since start of Ukraine war with Putin using celebrations to justify invasion

Russian troops fighting in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.

After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

Chinese troops march through Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day parade in on Friday. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent [admissions from both sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)
 that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

!Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin sitting side by side <image:3185>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day parade in Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

!Russian soldiers march in columns during a parade on Victory Day <image:3188>[View image in fullscreen](#img-5)

Russian troops who were involved in the war in Ukraine march in columns during a Victory Day parade. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The article includes images of captured Chinese fighters and discusses their recruitment, the timing of their capture, and the potential political implications. The article mentions that Ukraine has identified 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam)) <image:6>

The Guardian published an article about Chinese troops marching with Russian forces in Moscow's Red Square for Victory Day. ([https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)) <image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188> The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict, mentioning the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in supporting the response to the conflict. ([https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf))


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us), [https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan](https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan), and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")
, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")
 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)
 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Tise-2)
 By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")
.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
[\[8\]](#cite_note-igo40-8)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")
, a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production")
 in Belgium by [SABCA](/wiki/SABCA "SABCA")
.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 In 1921 the [Air Ministry](/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry")
 ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport")
, and later by [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
, on services to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris")
 and [Brussels](/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")
.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")
 was introduced during the early 1920s.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20)
 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)
 while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](/wiki/Biplane "Biplane")
 with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle")
 engine.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23)
 For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34")
 biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Flight180823-24)
 A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway")
 ordered a batch of nine.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")
, [passenger terminals](/wiki/Airport_terminal "Airport terminal")
, [hangars](/wiki/Hangar "Hangar")
, [airmail](/wiki/Airmail "Airmail")
, and [radio navigation](/wiki/Radio_navigation "Radio navigation")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)
 [Pan Am](/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am")
 opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38")
 through [Sikorsky S-42](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42")
.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Johnson-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-racing_p265-32)
 British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the [de Havilland Dragon Rapide](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide "De Havilland Dragon Rapide")
, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)
 It was also used in military roles;[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 civil Dragon Rapides were [impressed](/wiki/Impressment "Impressment")

The [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 appeared in 1935

Metal airliners came into service in the 1930s. In the United States, the [Boeing 247](/wiki/Boeing_247 "Boeing 247")
,[\[38\]](#cite_note-bhistory-38)
 and the 14-passenger [Douglas DC-2](/wiki/Douglas_DC-2 "Douglas DC-2")
,[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")
 and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[\[40\]](#cite_note-Mellberg-40)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")
, became the first commercial plane to circumnavigate the globe during December 1941 and January 1942.[\[44\]](#cite_note-Bull-44)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation")
 (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways")
 (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine")
 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland")

 was the first turboprop design to enter service;[\[52\]](#cite_note-Phipp81-52)
 a commercial success with 445 Viscounts built.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Andrews_and_Morgan,_p._537-53)
 The Type III requirement led to the conventional [Avro Tudor](/wiki/Avro_Tudor "Avro Tudor")
 and the more ambitious [Bristol Britannia](/wiki/Bristol_Britannia "Bristol Britannia")
, although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[\[54\]](#cite_note-Barnes347-54)
 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")
 turbojet engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. On 2 May 1952, the Comet took off on the world's first [jetliner](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
 flight carrying fare-paying passengers and simultaneously inaugurated scheduled service between London and Johannesburg.[\[56\]](#cite_note-bbc-56)
[\[57\]](#cite_note-cookman195207-57)
 However, roughly one year after introduction, three Comets broke up mid-flight due to airframe [metal fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(material) "Fatigue (material)")
, not well understood at the time.[\[58\]](#cite_note-withey_fatigue-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)
 The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[\[61\]](#cite_note-Phipp93-61)
[\[62\]](#cite_note-Jackson464-62)

By the 1960s, the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market, not regained by later designs like the [BAC 1-11](/wiki/BAC_1-11 "BAC 1-11")
, [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, and [Hawker Siddeley Trident](/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Trident "Hawker Siddeley Trident")
. The STAC committee was formed to consider [supersonic](/wiki/Supersonic "Supersonic")
 designs and worked with Bristol to create the [Bristol 223](/wiki/Bristol_223 "Bristol 223")
, a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner. The effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")

[United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 [DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
, Stapleton Airport, Denver, September 1966

The first batch of the [Douglas DC-4s](/wiki/Douglas_DC-4 "Douglas DC-4")
 went to the U.S. Army and Air Forces,\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] and was named the [C-54 Skymaster](/wiki/Douglas_C-54_Skymaster "Douglas C-54 Skymaster")
. Some ex-military DC-6s were later converted into airliners, with both passenger and cargo versions flooding the market shortly after the war's end. Douglas also developed a pressurized version of the DC-4, which it designated the [Douglas DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
. Rival company Lockheed produced the [Constellation](/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation "Lockheed Constellation")
, a triple-tailed aircraft with a wider fuselage than the DC-4.

The [Boeing 377 Stratocruiser](/wiki/Boeing_377_Stratocruiser "Boeing 377 Stratocruiser")
 was based on the [C-97 Stratofreighter](/wiki/Boeing_C-97_Stratofreighter "Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter")
 military transport, it had a double deck and a pressurized fuselage.

Convair produced the [Convair 240](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, a 40-person pressurized airplane; 566 examples flew. Convair later developed the [Convair 340](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers, of which 311 were produced. The firm also commenced work on the [Convair 37](/wiki/Convair_Model_37 "Convair Model 37")
, a relatively large double-deck airliner that would have served trans[continental](/wiki/Continent "Continent")
 routes; however, the project was abandoned due to a lack of customer demand and its high development costs.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

Rival planes include the [Martin 2-0-2](/wiki/Martin_2-0-2 "Martin 2-0-2")
 and [Martin 4-0-4](/wiki/Martin_4-0-4 "Martin 4-0-4")
, but the 2-0-2 had safety concerns and was unpressurized, while the 4-0-4 only sold around 100 units.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

During the postwar years, engines became much larger and more powerful, and safety features such as deicing, navigation, and weather information were added to the planes. American planes were allegedly more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

In 1936, the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers, leading to three [Latécoère 631s](/wiki/Lat%C3%A9co%C3%A8re_631 "Latécoère 631")
 introduced by [Air France](/wiki/Air_France "Air France")
 in July 1947.[\[65\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0114-65)
 However, two crashed and the third was removed from service over safety concerns. The [SNCASE Languedoc](/wiki/SNCASE_Languedoc "SNCASE Languedoc")
 was the first French post-war airliner.[\[66\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66)
 Accommodating up to 44 seats, 40 aircraft were completed for Air France between October 1945 and April 1948.[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)
 Air France withdrew the last Languedoc from its domestic routes in 1954, being replaced by later designs.[\[66\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66)
 First flying in February 1949, the four-engined [Breguet Deux-Ponts](/wiki/Breguet_Deux-Ponts "Breguet Deux-Ponts")

A [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")

The [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")
 was developed during the late 1950s as the first short range jet airliner. The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
, along with some fuselage elements.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 Entering service in mid 1959, 172 Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by 1963.[\[70\]](#cite_note-70)
 Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

The [Super-Caravelle](/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle "Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle")
 was a [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
 project of similar size and range to the Caravelle. It was merged with the similar [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
 project into the Anglo-French [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")
.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 The Concorde entered service in January 1967 as the second and last commercial [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
,[\[71\]](#cite_note-Gordon_Tu-144-71)
[\[72\]](#cite_note-Melik-Karamov_2000-72)

#### USSR

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: USSR")\

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\
\]

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, [Lockheed L-1011](/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011")
, [Boeing 707](/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")
), air ambulance ([USAF](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")
/[USN](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")
 [McDonnell Douglas DC-9](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")
), [reconnaissance](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance")
 ([Embraer ERJ 145](/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family")
, [Saab 340](/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340")
, and [Boeing 737](/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")
), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")
.[\[75\]](#cite_note-75)

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Market")\
\]

Since it began, the [jet airliner](/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner")
 market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)")
 going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel")
 till 2014 stimulating old jets replacement allowed by low [interest rates](/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate")
 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Manufacturer | 2016 orders and deliveries[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86) |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deliveries | values ($bn) | net orders | backlog |
| Boeing | 726 | 57.8 | 563 | 5,660 |
| Airbus | 685 | 45.5 | 711 | 6,845 |
| Embraer | 108 | 2.9 | 39  | 444 |

| ATR | 73  | 1.5 | 36  | 236 |
| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")
, itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth")
 but also [supply and demand](/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand")
 balance and [oil prices](/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price")
, while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing")
 help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old : there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[\[87\]](#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87)
 Oil prices and [airshow](/wiki/Airshow "Airshow")
 orders are trending together.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

In 2020, deliveries were down by more than 50% compared to 2019 due to the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation](/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_aviation "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation")
, after 10 years of growth.[\[89\]](#cite_note-Flight23dec2020-89)

Main article: [Aircraft cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

Baggage holds

 front lower compartment. Note the rollers for [ULDs](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The article includes images of captured Chinese fighters and discusses their recruitment, the timing of their capture, and the potential political implications. The article mentions that Ukraine has identified 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam)) <image:6>

The Guardian published an article about Chinese troops marching with Russian forces in Moscow's Red Square for Victory Day. ([https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)) <image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188> The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict, mentioning the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in supporting the response to the conflict. ([https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf))


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us), [https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan](https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan), and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918.

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money.

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

[![Wooden biplane-airboat model with space for two people, a passenger and the pilot. Flaglets are placed on the front structure in between the wings.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14081h.jpg?itok=Zl93ospv)](/multimedia-gallery/14081hjpg)

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

A model of the Boeing 40A.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999. 

[Look inside the Museum's 747](https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/v20170188004-panojpg)

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles).

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The article includes images of captured Chinese fighters and discusses their recruitment, the timing of their capture, and the potential political implications. The article mentions that Ukraine has identified 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam)) <image:6>

The Guardian published an article about Chinese troops marching with Russian forces in Moscow's Red Square for Victory Day. ([https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)) <image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188> The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict, mentioning the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in supporting the response to the conflict. ([https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf))


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us), [https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan](https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan), and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The article includes images of captured Chinese fighters and discusses their recruitment, the timing of their capture, and the potential political implications. The article mentions that Ukraine has identified 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam)) <image:6>

The Guardian published an article about Chinese troops marching with Russian forces in Moscow's Red Square for Victory Day. ([https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)) <image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188> The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict, mentioning the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in supporting the response to the conflict.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us), [https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan](https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan), and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - Chinese Red Cross will provide a batch of humanitarian assistance worth 5 million yuan ($791,540) to Ukraine, consisting of daily necessities, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday.

Russia's invasion into Ukraine last month has sent over 1.5 million Ukrainians fleeing abroad while those remaining in the encircled Ukrainian town of Mariupol were fast running out of out of electricity, heat, food, and drinking water after more than a week of bombardment.

China has refused to describe Russia's activities in Ukraine as invasion. Russia calls its actions a "special operation".

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

The Chinese government will provide another 10 million yuan ($1.57 million) worth of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Monday, after the Red Cross Society of China provided 5 million yuan worth of assistance to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society earlier this month.

"China is extremely concerned about civilians harmed in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia," Wang told a daily news conference. [![](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2018/global/logo1.png)](//global.chinadaily.com.cn)

China tops up Ukraine aid
=========================

By WANG QINGYUN | China Daily | Updated: 2022-03-22 08:50

Humanitarian aid supplies sent by the Red Cross Society of China to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society are transported in Warsaw, Poland, March 15, 2022. "The most urgent imperative for the international community is to tackle the potential large-scale humanitarian crisis that might arise in the conflict."

China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting the easing of tensions and make efforts to overcome the humanitarian crisis, Wang said.

The Red Cross Society of China said it provided three batches of emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine from March 9 to 14.These included food, sleeping bags, infant powdered formula, cotton quilts, and waterproof mats.

China has put forward a six-point proposal to ease the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, including that humanitarian action must be neutral and avoid politicization of humanitarian issues, and that effective measures should be taken to protect civilians and prevent secondary humanitarian disasters in Ukraine.

BEIJING — [China](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china)
’s Red Cross will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine “as soon as possible,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday, as he praised his country’s [friendship with Russia](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-china-forge-closer-ties-us-preoccupied-struggles-home-rcna15722)
 as “rock solid.”

China has refused to condemn [Russia’s attack on Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-mariupol-evacuation-temporary-ceasefire-rcna18878)
 or call it an invasion while asking Western countries to respect Russia’s “legitimate security concerns.”

Wang said the causes of the “Ukraine situation” were “complex” and had not happened overnight, noting, using a traditional Chinese expression, that “three feet of ice does not form in a single day.”

“Solving complex problems requires calmness and rationality, rather than adding fuel to the fire and intensifying contradictions,” he told a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China’s parliament.

China has already done “some work” to promote peace talks and has all along been in contact with all sides, he added.

“China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in pushing for peace and promoting talks, and is willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed.”

China is willing to continue to make its own efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis and the country’s Red Cross will “as soon as possible” provide a batch of aid to Ukraine, Wang said, without giving details. It was the first time the country has announced such help.

China proposes that “humanitarian action” must abide by the principles of neutrality and impartiality, and humanitarian issues should not be politicized, he added.

Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/frustrated-putin-may-order-escalation-violence-ukraine-us-officials-sa-rcna18026)
 met Chinese President [Xi Jinping](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-xi-jinping-historical-resolution-entrench-rule-party-plenum-rcna4796)
 hours before the start of last month’s [Winter Olympics](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/beijing-winter-olympics-draw-close-rcna16610)
 in Beijing, where they [signed a wide-ranging strategic partnership](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-standoff-russia-putin-china-beijing-winter-olympics-rcna14862)
 aimed at countering U.S. influence and said they would have “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.”

Wang said the friendship between China and Russia was “rock solid” and prospects for cooperation bright.

“No matter how sinister the international situation is, both China and Russia will maintain their strategic determination and continuously push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in the new era.”

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China has been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence does show Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine and Chinese troops marching with Russian forces.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific information about the Red Cross troops' deployment to the front lines.

**A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.**

**A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.**

The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.

Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, [calling it "fake news"](https://www.instagram.com/stories/bugatti_paris/3403151154050783240/)
, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.

But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral.

A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans

! <image:1733>!A fake version of an invoice from a Bugatti dealership, with a "FAKE" stamp on it <image:1736>

Several errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.

The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.

Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.

It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort.

It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.

But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news.

At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities.

“For me it’s a game," he said. <image:1733>!YouTube Screenshot of a YouTube video featuring false claims that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion from King Charles III <image:1748>YouTube

A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a £20m mansion from King Charles III

Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics.

One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.

It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account."

Content: "Car Lovers Group said the invoice is not theirs, and it contains errors that show it's fabricated, including the lack of required legal details and an incorrect price for the vehicle. 

Russian [disinformation networks](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
 have spread similar false claims about Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family in the past year, including a false claim that he bought two luxury yachts for millions of dollars, and a false claim that Zelenska bought over $1 million worth of jewelry at Cartier in New York City.

Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst for cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told CBS News that false stories about corruption are created to undermine Western support for Ukraine and "erode trust in the leaders, their institutions, and international alliances."

The falsehoods play into existing [concerns](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/index/ukr)
 and documented reports about corruption in Ukraine, researchers say.

Darren Linvill, a Russian disinformation expert and professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, said the false claims are "framed for a very particular audience that wants to hear and is ready to hear that and repeat it."

Linvill said the narratives have managed to gain traction online, despite being debunked — likely because of the cost and status of the brand used by the network. Bugatti Paris — which is operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company — [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/C86tVZWKjLS/?hl=en&img_index=2)

 video that falsely claims the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti sports car has racked up millions of views on social media, CBS News has found. The video is part of a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at degrading Western support for Ukraine, researchers said. 

CBS News determined the video was [created using artificial intelligence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)

Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on June 18, 2024.

London CNN  — 

A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of [Ukrainian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple’s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN’s analysis and disinformation experts.

The AI-generated [video](https://x.com/aussiecossack/status/1807774973047758873)
 features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7.

The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Clément Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-[Russian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/russia)
 influencers.

Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and “firmly denounced this disinformation campaign.”

“A supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,” it said, adding that the group “strongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.”

“The mandatory legal details don’t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,” the statement added.

The group also said it has taken legal action “by filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation” – but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed.

Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated “a high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.”

The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media.

A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. “Only minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube.”

 [](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=mfh_reports)
from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September.

A [report by Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections)
, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network.

Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN.

“They scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO."

In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has demonstrated he wants to have influence in the debate on European security, which has accelerated dramatically since Washington opened discussions with Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine.

"We are at a crossroads in history," he warned on Sunday, March 2, at the [conclusion of the summit he chaired in London](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/eu-s-ursula-von-der-leyen-says-we-urgently-have-to-rearm-europe-after-ukraine-talks_6738734_4.html)
, which was attended by a dozen other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The meeting had been convened by Downing Street a week earlier, but it took on a dramatic turn following the humiliation inflicted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday.

Faced with the American duo brutally attacking a leader they consider a hero, Europeans now find themselves in urgent need of salvaging what remains of the relationship between Washington and Kyiv – and, beyond that, the Western order guaranteed by the United States for the past 80 years.

He derided the outcome of the London meeting as "a desperate attempt to pass off as success the failure of a 10-year policy of inciting Ukraine towards Russia by the same Great Britain and, until recently, the United States".

"Europe has no plan," wrote Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia's upper house of parliament.

"And if Ukraine should count on something, it can only be on progress (if there is any to come) in Russian-American relations."

He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hosted the meeting, "cannot fail to understand this".

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, also known as the Securing Our Future London Summit, took place on March 2, 2025, in London, hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The summit aimed to create a "coalition of the willing" in Europe to present a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. Outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including £1.6 billion in UK export finances for air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit also aimed to build strong security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure a lasting ceasefire or peace deal. Articles from Le Monde and Reuters also covered the summit, with the former mentioning a peace plan and the latter reporting on Russian parliamentarians dismissing the summit. <image:3110> <image:3111>

The summit was attended by leaders including Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky.

This article is part of: [World Economic Forum Annual Meeting](https://www.weforum.org/meetings/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2024/)

*   Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with leaders at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, which takes place from 15–19 January in Davos, Switzerland.
*   In his special address and during a closed-door session, he called on business leaders to invest in Ukraine: “Because people need jobs.”
*   Amid the challenge of war, the country has been undertaking a host of business-friendly reforms and saw GDP grow by more than 5% in 2023.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, there was an expectation that the country would quickly capitulate that was [echoed by many analysts](https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-surprises-russia-putins-months-long-devastating-war-ukraine-2022-12?r=US&IR=T)
.

As Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, reminded participants at the 2024 Annual Meeting in Davos, that is not how things played out. ![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addresses participants at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024.](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/ID94BLyjYVb6YAygjEt_oWBYdsCbftJhLHvS9wOl1OA.jpg)

That’s largely, Schwab pointed out, because of the country’s resilience in the face of aggression. “Business investment is so necessary,” Zelenskyy said in a closed-door session that brought together over 70 global CEOs from among the Forum’s partner companies. And while Ukraine’s economy [fell by almost 30%](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-gdp-fell-291-2022-during-russias-invasion-2023-04-13/#:~:text=KYIV%2C%20April%2013%20(Reuters),Moscow's%20Feb.)
 in 2022, following Russia’s invasion, this past year it grew by over 5%, Zelenskyy told participants in his special address. It’s also because of the [billions it has received in aid from the US](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts)
 and [Europe](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-solidarity-ukraine/)
.

Today, Zelenskyy called for a different kind of investment: from the private sector."

**What was claimed:** A photo shows President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently wearing a suit to meet WEF founder Klaus Schwab because he is his “actual boss”, amid criticism Mr Zelenskyy received for not wearing one to meet President Trump.

**Our verdict:** This photo shows the two men in suits in 2020, before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after which President Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly.

* * *

A photo of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the World Economic Forum (WEF) founder, Klaus Schwab, is being shared with claims it shows him wearing a suit for his “actual boss”.

Advertisement The post suggests President Zelenskyy recently wore one to meet Mr Schwab, but not Mr Trump.

But this is missing important context. Mr Zelenskyy does not appear to have worn a suit in public since the day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022—he [shared a video](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/725)
 that day in which he wore a suit—but the photo with Mr Schwab predates this.

The photo [circulating online](https://www.facebook.com/SteveLawsonOfficial/posts/pfbid034ZpTJjHyGodjv2q1sqKqvuxxNgBA8MT2yPjFJ1MpryoL5TMDaXKc9MMC7YVTNP1al)

 more militaristic, dressed-down attire, including sweatshirts that often feature the [Ukrainian trident symbol](https://ukraine.ua/stories/trident-tryzub/)
.

In an [interview with the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001jv9l)
 in February 2023, [Mr Zelenskyy said](https://youtu.be/HSRjeluwkOY?si=Gdh1A8Aq--Kd9G-3&t=554)
 about his decision to stop wearing suits: “It was more comfortable and more understandable for people. And it's very strange when it’s a war and you’re in a suit.”.

In response to a question from a US journalist at the recent meeting in Washington, Mr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1d4r9yvqzpo#:~:text=%22I%20will%20wear%20costume%20after%20this%20war%20will%20finish%2C%22%20Zelensky%20replied.%20(The%20word%20%22suit%22%20can%20be%20translated%20into%20Ukrainian%20as%20%22kostyum%22.))
: “I will wear costume after this war will finish,” (a Ukrainian word for “suit” is “kostyum”).

It’s not exactly clear what the post means about Mr Schwab being Mr Zelenskyy’s “actual boss”, but we could find no evidence to support this. It has been captioned: “The only time Zelensky will wear a suit is when he meets his actual Boss!”

But this is not a recent photo."

During her four years at Fox News, Aubrie Spady helped [lead](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady)
 the conservative news outlet’s energy and environmental coverage, consistently elevating the voices of those pushing Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and condemning President Joe Biden’s climate and conservation policies.

In January, Spady wrote [a story](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/burgum-grilled-environmental-issues-targeted-by-trump-drill-baby-drill)
 on Doug Burgum’s nomination to serve as President Donald Trump’s Interior Secretary, focusing on his pledge to “drill, baby, drill.” Once Burgum was confirmed to the powerful post in February, Spady shifted to friendly coverage of how the former North Dakota governor was “[taking aim](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exciting-chapter-interior-sec-takes-aim-biden-oil-lease-ban-coercive-climate-policies-day-1-orders)

During Trump’s first term, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tapped David Spady to serve on an advisory panel focused on hunting, shooting sports and big game conservation, as I [reported](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-wildlife-conservation-montana-david-spady_n_5b153d81e4b010565aadf457)

Much of Aubrie Spady’s reporting at Fox appeared to dovetail with her father’s work, marked by the same animosity he has for government regulation and the environmental and climate movements.

” and Washington bureaucrats who he said had prioritized protecting the delta smelt, an imperiled fish, over the needs of farmers.

[Jul 9](https://www.publicdomain.media/p/aubrie-spady-interior-department-trump-maga-fox-news/comment/133419808 "Jul 9, 2025, 1:21 AM")

I think those Department of Interior videos are godawful propaganda. And a few weeks into Burgum’s tenure, Spady landed [an “exclusive” stor](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-department-cafeteria-empty-years-under-biden-source)
y about how the Interior Department cafeteria had remained shuttered during Biden’s presidency — a piece that cited “a source close to the situation” and included a statement from Burgum in which he bemoaned how few people were showing up to the office.

Burgum and his team seem to have liked what they saw from the young reporter. In 2013, her father produced a documentary, titled “[Wolves in Government Clothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPZXevpiGBg)
,” in which he argued that wolves and people are “incompatible” and that the Endangered Species Act has empowered “predators” in government to “destroy people’s lives.”

At the time of both films, David Spady was California state director of Americans for Prosperity, a right-wing political advocacy group that fossil fuel tycoons David and Charles Koch founded in 2004.

Then there are her father’s friends and allies in the GOP, some of whom Spady seemingly had easy access to while working as a Fox News reporter. Spady [authored](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ryan-zinke-wins-re-election-montana-first-congressional-district)
 the Fox News story on Zinke’s victory.

Spady also landed [exclusive interviews](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-blasts-biden-doj-trump-indictment-dark-day-america)
 with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), [another close contact](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-wildlife-conservation-montana-david-spady_n_5b153d81e4b010565aadf457)
 of her father’s, [and Daines](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-senate-race-majority-intense-ground-game-operation-nrsc-chairman)
 while he was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

When Trump was re-elected to the White House in November, David Spady was at the election-night watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida."

Content: "This time, they posted a fake about “the Ukrainian Center for Psychological and Information War received \[from USAID\] funds amounting to $140 million monthly.” Our fact-checking department debunked this news.

What happened? 
---------------

On Feb 12, the Telegram channel [Медведь](https://t.me/bear007/62493?single)
 (“Bear,” [archive](https://archive.ph/f2kqp)
), which regularly spreads Russian disinformation, published a post from American Fox News publication, “Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine \[PIWCU\] received $140,000,000 per month from USAID.”

!зображення до посту: Debunking Russian fakes. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:13800>

We’ve checked the [official website](https://www.foxnews.com/)
 of Fox News and figured out that the article is absent from the list of [Aubrie Spady’s publications](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady?msockid=24fc82c6537363ae340d97415261625e)
. 

On Feb 10, the author didn’t publish anything mentioning the Ukrainian psychological and information operation center. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:13799>

Analysis
--------

As evidence, Telegram authors added what seems to be an article by Fox News: its author is Aubrie Spady, and the date of the article’s publication is Feb 10, 2025.

In the end, we checked the information about the operations of centers of information-psychological operations in Ukraine, one of which is mentioned in the post of propagandists. 

The official website of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence notes that information-psychological operations are the [area of responsibility](https://mod.gov.ua/pro-nas/sili-speczialnih-operaczij)
 of the Forces of Special Operations. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:13801>

For the next step, we’ve checked the information about key financing directions that USAID covered in Ukraine in 2024. So, PIWCU in Ukraine, which does psychological and information warfare, would be part of this structure."

His full quote is: "If Ukraine loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO states, then the US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly in the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war."

Did USAID pay for pro-Ukrainian bots and fakes about Russia?
------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Fox News reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center to create pro-Ukrainian bots and fake news about Russia.

A manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article dated February 10, 2025 has circulated on social media —including [X](https://archive.ph/sqt7Z "External link — X")
, [Reddit](https://archive.ph/ibFZR "External link — Reddit")
, [Telegram](https://archive.ph/f2kqp "External link — Telegram")
, and [Facebook](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/jhCqq "External link — Facebook")
. The altered image claims USAID funds Ukraine's "Psychological and Information Warfare Center" at a rate of $140 million per month. A 2024 [report (pages 24–27)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/14/2003647338/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF "External link — report (pages 24–27)")
 by the Special Inspector General to the US Congress, which monitored government activity related to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024, explained Congress appropriated $182.75 billion for Ukraine-related efforts. USAID's share was approximately $39.9 billion, with the bulk allocated to humanitarian aid, governance programs, and public service support.

There was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center."

If USAID were spending $140 million per month (roughly $1.68 billion annually) on a single program, that amount would dwarf the agency's entire budget for operating expenses, inspection, and health programs combined during the same period.

According to [the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://archive.ph/UkbYb "External link — the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense")
, the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). The timestamp in the screenshot matches [a different report](https://archive.ph/XKPDO "External link — a different report")
, indicating that the image was repurposed to spread the false claim.

Trump’s criticism of the Ukrainian leader, both before and during Zelenskyy's visit to the White House, seems to have fueled interest in anti-Ukrainian disinformation narratives.Image: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 has been a target of pro-Russian propaganda for years, but a fresh wave of accusations and defamation against him and his country is surging online.

This latest disinformation campaign was fueled by a [recent dispute in the Oval Office](/en/trump-zelenskyy-white-house-fight-ukrainian-reactions/a-71795975)
 between Zelenskyy, [US President Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 and Vice-President [JD Vance](/en/jd-vance/t-70177094)
.

"NewsGuard has seen a significant increase in false claims about Ukraine on US social media in recent weeks, particularly since Donald Trump accused Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for US military support," Madeline Roache, managing editor at misinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told DW.

"We've seen an avalanche of different disinformation campaigns, influence campaigns, different means trying to portray President Zelenskyy personally as a bad leader, the person that should resign, the person that made everything wrong and that Ukraine is bad, corrupt and should stop the war. And that Ukraine wants to prolong the war rather than stop it," Roman Osadchuk, an open source and disinformation researcher at the National University of Kyiv, told DW.

Many of these claims [align with pro-Russian propaganda narratives](/en/fact-check-russian-fake-news-targets-ukraines-zelenskyy/a-68346906)
 about the [war in Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
, often depicting Zelenskyy as corrupt and profiting from the conflict. The screenshot features a Fox News journalist's byline and an alleged statement asserting that the center has been fabricating content and deploying bots since 2022.

**DW Fact Check:** False.

Fox News never published such a story. From February 18 to February 24, 2025, NewsGuard identified about 27,600 social media posts and articles mentioning "Zelenskyy" alongside terms like "villa," "yacht," "winery," or "mansion" — a 2,524% increase from the previous six-day period, which saw just 1,050 such mentions.

[DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of the viral claims.

Did Zelenskyy swear at Trump on camera in London? 
--------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Zelensky burning a very big bridge," [claimed](https://archive.ph/F7L06 "External link — claimed")
an X user in a post that garnered 4 million views. The post features a video allegedly showing Zelenskyy swearing at Trump while arriving to meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the day after their argument in the Oval Office. Additionally, [journalist Aubrie Spady's author page on the Fox News website](https://archive.ph/MkVZy# "External link — journalist Aubrie Spady's author page on the Fox News website")
contains no record of the alleged article. A January 2025 [US Department of State fact sheet](https://archive.ph/FGy87 "External link — US Department of State fact sheet")
 on US military aid to Ukraine stated that SOF received a total of $42 million, which was allocated for training and other services to develop SOF and Ukraine's National Guard, conventional forces, non-commissioned officer corps, and combat medical care since 2014.

Did Ukraine stage war scenes to get more money from the US?
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Ukraine 'soldiers' have resorted to faking combat in order to appear 'war torn' so the slush fund from the US keeps churning money their way!"  [claimed](https://archive.ph/Mhho8 "External link — claimed")
an X user, posting a video showing a woman in combat uniform receiving professional makeup and asking in Ukrainian whether she should tighten her helmet.

The post went viral, garnering 8.1 million views."

The article mentions that the journalist Aubrie Spady's author page on the Fox News website contains no record of the alleged article. The article also mentions that the US Department of State fact sheet stated that SOF received a total of $42 million for training and other services. <image:11>

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1

NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:11> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Fox News article with the title 'Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine received $140,000,000 per month from USAID'."

## Actions
```
web_search("Aubrie Spady Fox News")
web_search("Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine USAID Fox News")
```

# Search Result
From [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms): 
Content: "
Claim: Fox News reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center to create pro-Ukrainian bots and fake news about Russia. The altered image claims USAID funds Ukraine's "Psychological and Information Warfare Center" at a rate of $140 million per month. 
There was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center."  
If USAID were spending $140 million per month (roughly $1.68 billion annually) on a single program, that amount would dwarf the agency's entire budget for operating expenses, inspection, and health programs combined during the same period. Edition

"NewsGuard has seen a significant increase in false claims about Ukraine on US social media in recent weeks, particularly since Donald Trump accused Volodymyr [Zelensky](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/volodymyr-zelenskyy)
 of being ungrateful for US military support," Madeline Roache, managing editor at misinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told DW. 
"We've seen an avalanche of different disinformation campaigns, influence campaigns, different means trying to portray President Zelenskyy personally as a bad leader, the person that should resign, the person that made everything wrong and that Ukraine is bad, corrupt and should stop the war. And that Ukraine wants to prolong the war rather than stop it," Roman Osadchuk, an open source and disinformation researcher at the National University of Kyiv, told DW. 
A manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article dated February 10, 2025 has circulated on social media —including X, Reddit, Telegram, and Facebook . The screenshot features a Fox News journalist's byline and an alleged statement asserting that the center has been fabricating content and deploying bots since 2022."

The poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 67% of respondents trusted Zelenskiy in March, up from 57% a month earlier.

The survey was conducted from February 14 to March 4 - a challenging time for Zelenskiy as Kyiv's relations with the United States, its biggest military backer, plunged into crisis after the [Oval Office meeting](/world/trump-zelenskiy-sign-minerals-deal-white-house-meeting-2025-02-28/)
 on February 28.

Anton Hrushetskyi, KIIS' executive director, said the poll showed Ukrainians were rallying behind Zelenskiy more than three years after [Russia's full-scale invasion](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)

*   Summary

*   Zelenskiy-Trump White House spat hit U.S.-Ukraine ties
*   US has paused military aid and intelligence sharing
*   Ukrainians are rallying round Zelenskiy, pollster says

KYIV, March 7 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's approval rating has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with U.S. But in the east Zelenskiy's trust ratings were lower - at about 60%.

Ukraine's eastern regions are where the fiercest fighting is taking place, with Russian troops devastating cities and towns and taking village after village.

The poll showed that 29% of respondents did not trust Zelenskiy at the start of March, down from 37% at the start of February.

The latest outburst from the Russian president regarding the supposed illegitimacy of his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, dates back to March 28. On that day, the Kremlin leader proposed the creation of a "temporary government" in Ukraine under the auspices of the United Nations, tasked with "hold\[ing\] democratic elections, to bring to power a viable government that enjoys the trust of the people." This was presented at the time as a necessary step to sign a peace agreement.

The statement did not surprise anyone in Kyiv, given the Russian president's habit of questioning Zelensky's legitimacy."

LONDON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday joined Russian President Vladimir Putin in claiming Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacks legitimacy, the American leader alleging -- without providing evidence -- that Zelenskyy currently has a [4% approval rating](https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-trusted-zelenskyy-moscow-us-talks-attack/story?id=118955233)

In reality, respected polls in Ukraine show that Zelenskyy has over 50% approval among Ukrainians. 19, 2025, amid the Russian attack on Ukraine.

The president said he would conduct opinion polls for trust ratings for world leaders, including Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Zelenskyy said he took Trump's comments "calmly."

"As for President Trump, with all due respect to him as a leader of the American people, who we deeply respect and are thankful for all his support, but President Trump, unfortunately, is living in this disinformation space," Zelenskyy continued.

There is currently no politician in Ukraine considered to have stronger support than Zelenskyy. and has not yet entered politics.

Hours after [historic U.S.-Russia talks](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-russia-set-begin-high-stakes-talks-ukraines/story?id=118900923)
 concluded in Saudi Arabia, Trump suggested to reporters at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy's alleged low public approval meant the country should hold a new presidential election, its 2024 contest having been postponed because Ukraine has been under martial law since Putin's invasion three years ago.

"That's not a Russia thing, that's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also," Trump said.

Trump's claims indicated that he -- like Putin -- may now be seeking Zelenskyy's removal as part of any deal to end the war.

Putin appears to see removing Zelenskyy as a key goal, both as a victory he can present to Russians and as a potential opportunity to install a pro-Russian leader in his place. <image:360>

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gives a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. The most recent, published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in early February, showed that 57% of respondents said they trusted Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy's level of support is diminished from the extraordinary highs of earlier in the war. The February poll did show a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.

Still, the 50% or more regularly scored by Zelenskyy in various polls is higher than those achieved by many democratic leaders around the world.

Aides in Kyiv were quick to point out on Wednesday that Zelenskyy's recent score of 57% in the KIIS poll was higher than Trump's backing in recent U.S. That is why the Russian president is pushing for elections to be held before any final peace deal.

Zelenskyy pushed back firmly on Wednesday, fact-checking Trump and saying he was suffering from exposure to Russian disinformation.

"If someone wants to replace me right now, then right now it won't work," the president told reporters in Kyiv before a planned meeting with Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg.

"If we are talking about 4% then we have seen this disinformation, we understand that it comes from Russia," he added. 18, 2025, in Palm Beach, Fla."

ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)) stated that Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025, but polls showed it was over 50% <image:360>. Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/04/24/russian-and-american-pressure-boost-zelensky-s-popularity_6740575_23.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/04/24/russian-and-american-pressure-boost-zelensky-s-popularity_6740575_23.html)) reported that Trump referred to Zelensky as a "dictator without elections" in February 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)) states that Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025. However, the same source indicates that polls showed the approval rating was over 50% at that time.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. While Donald Trump did claim Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025, this was contradicted by polls showing a much higher approval rating.

`false`

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)
 to discuss Nato membership.

*   **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** today made the case for a diplomatic settlement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the Nato military alliance. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)
 to discuss Nato membership.

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

We have some more comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at [the joint press conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff#block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff)
 with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv.

“Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a Nato member,” Zelenskyy said.

The French president Emmanuel Macron caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus on the matter.

“Even if we get invited \[to Nato\], what happens then? Russian forces have mostly encircled but not yet taken major cities, and few major rail or road arteries have been severed recently._
> 
> _Russian control of Ukrainian territory has increased from 17.4% in November 2023 to 17.9% as of 30 November 2024._
> 
> _Russia has made the most territorial gains in Donetsk, where it has gained 1,804 sq km since the start of the year."

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he’s open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end [the almost three-year war](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)
 with Russia.

The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel.

“But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,” Zelenskyy said.

His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when [Russia has gained an upper hand](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-f7f56e494df1dbbcdec1853001796c45)
 in the fighting.

U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he’s still in office, while Trump doesn’t yet have “legal rights” to decide on the matter.

“He wants to have a cease-fire,” Trump said of Zelenskyy in comments to the New York Post published Sunday. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

WASHINGTON (AP) — [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 on Sunday pushed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine, describing it as part of his active efforts as president-elect to [end the war](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)
 despite being weeks from taking office.

“Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and [pulling the United States out of NATO](https://apnews.com/article/trump-nato-presidential-election-congress-republicans-20e902788e8701999ce0424f73d478cc)

, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term.

Asked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of NATO, Trump indicated that was an open question.

“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he said.

But if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the U.S. “I don’t want to say anything about that, because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” Trump said.

Trump’s call for an immediate ceasefire went beyond the public policy stands taken by the Biden administration and Ukraine and drew a cautious response from Zelenskyy. 20 inauguration to resolve one of the major global crises facing the lame-duck Biden administration.

Trump made his proposal after a [weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders](https://apnews.com/article/trump-paris-notre-dame-f97fde62ca2ce68c3874c395b305e26b)
 in Paris, where [many world leaders gathered](https://apnews.com/article/trump-paris-notre-dame-f97fde62ca2ce68c3874c395b305e26b)
 to celebrate the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral after a devastating fire. But the 1799 statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction.

In the NBC interview taped Friday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies that he did not see continued U.S. arms and other military support are vital to Ukraine’s efforts to fend off invading Russian forces, and Biden has been [surging assistance to Ukraine](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-military-weapons-nuclear-42d5d374faf445b811c6abe422da05eb)
 before leaving office.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday [announced nearly $1 billion more](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-weapons-russia-trump-biden-himars-zelenskyy-7b2560ad6bd54a6275da0ceb5241c0e8)

 and many in the U.S. He was referring to mediation efforts by China that many in the West have seen as favoring Russia.

Zelenskyy described his discussions Saturday with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as “constructive” but has given no further details.

Zelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.”

“When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Peskov referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that declared the prospect of any talks “impossible” as long as Putin was Russia’s leader.

That decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.

Trump’s former national security adviser, retired Lt. The quick responses from Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the seriousness with which they regarded the idea from the incoming American president.

Both Trump and President Joe Biden pointed this weekend to [Russia’s disengagement in Syria](https://apnews.com/article/trump-syria-biden-ukraine-russia-putin-assad-cbb3ad1fe14ccd32452aa118140e23cf)

, as evidence of the extent to which the Ukraine war has sapped Russia’s resources.

Biden said at the White House on Sunday that resistance from Ukraine had “left Russia unable to protect its main ally in the Middle East.”

The Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have made a point of not being seen to press Ukraine for an immediate truce."

WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 12: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and U.S. He stated that he had good meetings with Trump when he was president, “but we didn’t \[go\] through the war with him.”

Zelenskyy spoke just hours after the United States, Germany, Romania, Netherlands and Italy announced plans to provide five strategic air defense systems — including four [Patriot](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/patriot/)
 batteries — to Ukraine and signaled that another round of donations could be on its way soon.

“We are working on a further announcement this year of additional strategic air defense systems for Ukraine,” the countries announced in a joint statement today upon the opening of the NATO Summit in Washington this week.

The United States, Germany and Romania will each donate a Patriot battery; the Netherlands and several unnamed countries will provide components that will facilitate the operation of a fourth Patriot battery, and Italy will give another SAMP-T system.

In addition to the longer-range systems, the US and a collection of allies — including Canada, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom — promised “dozens” of tactical air defense systems, including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard systems.

And the United States will deliver “hundreds” of interceptors for those systems over the next year.

“The United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line,” Biden said in a speech opening the summit. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON— While the curtain opened on the NATO Summit, [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/)
 aimed his sights on winning over Republicans, giving a speech at a GOP stronghold amid uncertainty over whether likely GOP candidate former President Donald Trump would continue military aid to [Ukraine](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/ukraine/)
 if elected in November.

“Now, everyone is waiting for November: Americans are waiting for November. I hope it will never change.”

Throughout his remarks, Zelenskyy refrained from criticism of Trump, who has questioned whether the United States should remain in NATO and has signaled he may revoke support for Ukraine if it refuses to meet Russia for peace talks. Instead, he appealed to America’s economic might and military power, repeatedly stating that US leaders must not let the country be bullied by a weaker nation.

No matter whether [President Joe Biden](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joe-biden/)
 or Trump win the election, America’s president must understand that Putin will oppose the United States on principle due to its democratic values, and cannot trust in the Russian leader as a partner, Zelenskyy said.

“Biden and Trump are very different but they are supportive \[of\] democracy, and that’s why I think Putin will hate both of them,” he said. “But I think both of them need to understand it — not to count on his attitude.”

Zelenskyy warned that if the United States exits [NATO](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/nato/)
, bad actors could be emboldened to invade other nations such as Poland, and “the world will lose a lot of countries because of people like Putin.”

When asked whether he was concerned about a potential Trump administration, Zelenskyy said he hoped that Trump would continue current US policy toward Ukraine. President Joe Biden hold a news conference in the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on December 12, 2023 in Washington, DC. “They will get this assistance before anyone else gets it.”

Throughout the speech and fireside chat, Zelenskyy repeatedly thanked the United States and NATO for its donation of additional air defense systems, but added that “it will not be enough” as Russia is actively working to figure out how to defeat the Patriot systems.

While GOP support for Ukraine in Congress has faltered in recent months, some key lawmakers like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have continued to back military aid for Ukraine. Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific — the whole world is waiting for November,” Zelenskyy said in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute this evening.

[Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/vladimir-putin/)
 is also “waiting for November,” Zelenskyy added during a fireside chat following the speech."

On December 2, anonymous Russian-language accounts on Facebook and Instagram ([1](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=541571908871528&set=a.101819279513462)
, [2](https://www.instagram.com/vizovvremenivv/p/DDE_2QJt2iJ/)
) spread information claiming that Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million. Reports about the hotel sale have been spread by a questionable French-language media outlet, registered on November 25 of this year, while the link, which according to the report leads to the hotel’s website, is fraudulent and was created on November 22.**

Several fact-checking organizations ( [Dpa](https://dpa-factchecking.com/belgium/241203-99-214531/?fbclid=IwY2xjawG88MtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbkKjc7q2HviTLlnsH5KzjC2JQPi3w2sNcgRkQEHVvvYgS8-qSYNs4frmw_aem_cnqG1ln1AEcVYLnwDOBbxQ)
, [Afp](https://factuel.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36P36LD)

) have published articles on this topic. Therefore, the newly registered site under the same name is fraudulent.

[![morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png "morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com")](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png)

The archived version of the fake website states that the hotel is owned by Film Heritage Inc., an offshore company that was reportedly managed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, until 2019. This fact has been reported by [various media outlets](https://lobservateurdemonaco.com/enquetes/hotel-de-luxe-courchevel-sbm/)
, but nowhere does it state that the hotel was resold and purchased by the Zelenskyy family.

It is worth noting that the claim that the Zelenskyy family spends Western money on personal luxuries has long been circulating and used as a Russian method to discredit Zelenskyy. *   [About Us](https://mythdetector.com/en/about-us/)

The posts also allege that this information was reported in French media.

**The information claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an expensive villa in France is false. [Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation](https://t.me/CenterCounteringDisinformation/12442)
 has also addressed the issue.

The claim about Zelensky purchasing a villa in France appeared on a French-language website, [Les Echos de la France](https://lesechosdelafrance.fr/la-societe-de-zelensky-a-achete-un-hotel-dans-la-station-de-ski-de-courchevel/)
, which presents itself as a media outlet, on November 28. However, using relevant keywords to search online, we found no such information in any reputable media sources.

The [Les Echos de la France](https://lesechosdelafrance.fr/la-societe-de-zelensky-a-achete-un-hotel-dans-la-station-de-ski-de-courchevel/)
 article includes a hyperlink to the hotel’s website, which is currently [inaccessible](https://hotelpalacedesneiges.com/)
. However, the official website of [Palace des Neiges](https://www.montecarlosbm.com/en/hotel-courchevel/monte-carlo-one-courchevel)
 does not mention that Film Heritage Inc. The Myth Detector has [uncovered](https://mythdetector.com/ka/dezinphormatsia-thithqos-zelenskim-gebelsis-qhophili-vila-sheidzina/)

LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - A Russian man serving time in prison for burning a copy of the Koran was found guilty by a court on Monday in a separate treason case and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

A regional court in Volgograd in southwestern Russia said it had convicted Nikita Zhuravel, 20, of state treason for corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation."

Zhuravel's case drew attention last year when Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov published video showing his son Adam, then 15, beating and kicking him while he was in prison in Chechnya awaiting trial for burning a Koran in Volgograd, his hometown.

Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Islamic faith in the overwhelmingly Muslim republic, where Zhuravel was transferred after what Russian investigators said was public pressure from Chechens.

The office of Russia's Prosecutor General said last month that Zhuravel had also been accused of sending footage of a freight train carrying warplanes, and information about the movements of a car linked to a Russian military base to a representative of Ukrainian intelligence.

Zhuravel had pleaded guilty to the crime, the court said in a statement on Telegram on Monday, adding that he had been opposed to what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Russia rarely comments on individual criminal cases.

Zhuravel is serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence following his [conviction](/world/europe/court-russias-chechnya-sentences-man-3-12-years-koran-burning-tass-2024-02-27/)
 in February under Russia's law against offending religious believers. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Defendant Nikita Zhuravel attends a court hearing in the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russia, February 27, 2024. Investigators said he had confessed to publicly burning the Koran in a stunt paid for by Ukrainian intelligence.

It was not clear under what circumstances the alleged confession was made.

The number of such cases has risen sharply in Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, as intelligence agencies pursue a crackdown on suspected foreign spies and agents.

Yevgeny Smirnov, a member of a Russian lawyers' association called Pervy Otdel (First Department) which has in the past helped defend people accused of treason, said Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, sometimes tries to entrap people.

He said the FSB contacts people known to be opposed to the war over the internet and encouraged them to commit crimes, such as setting fire to military buildings or sending sensitive information related to the Russian military.

Reuters could not independently verify his assertion."

**ISTANBUL**

A Russian man who was convicted earlier this year for burning a copy of the Muslims' holy book, the Quran, has been sentenced to an additional 14 years in prison for treason.

Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in a maximum-security penal colony by a regional court in the Russian city of Volgograd, Russian state news agency Tass reported, citing court documents.

However, according to Tass, the Volgograd Regional Court allowed him to appeal the ruling, with Zhuravel's lawyer expressing his client’s intention to do so.

Last month, the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office said in a statement that its Volgograd regional office approved the indictment in the Zhuravel case.

According to those investigating the case, Zhuravel offered his services to a representative of the Ukrainian security service via messenger, the statement said.

“In March 2023, Zhuravel sent him (the representative) video recordings of a train carrying military equipment of the Russian Armed Forces, military aircraft, as well as data on the movement of an official vehicle of one of the military units,” it added.

Earlier in February, Zhuravel received a three-and-a-half-year sentence after being detained in May 2023 for burning a copy of the Quran in front of a Volgograd mosque. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Trial begins for Russian accused of sending military video to Ukraine

Print

MOSCOW — 

A Russian man went on trial Thursday on charges of high treason for a video he allegedly sent to Ukraine's security services, the latest in a growing series of espionage cases involving the conflict.

The Volgograd District Court began hearing a new case against Nikita Zhuravel, who is currently serving a 3½-year sentence for burning a Quran in front of a mosque.

The new charges are based on allegations that Zhuravel filmed a trainload of military equipment and warplanes in 2023 and sent the video to a representative of Ukraine's security agency. Accessibility links

Trial begins for Russian accused of sending military video to Ukraine
=====================================================================

!Nikita Zhuravel is escorted by police from a court after a hearing on a treason case in Volgograd, Russia, on Nov. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.

Rights activists say Zhuravel is a political prisoner who was beaten while in custody.

While in pretrial custody before his first sentence, Zhuravel was beaten by the 15-year-old son of Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed strongman leader of the mostly Muslim region of Chechnya. He later awarded his son with the medal of "Hero of the Republic of Chechnya."

Federal authorities have refrained from any criticism of the Chechen strongman.

Separately, a military court on Thursday sentenced to 24 years in prison a man convicted of treason and terrorism for setting fire to a military recruitment office in Moscow. 14, 2024. <image:13820>

Nikita Zhuravel is escorted by police from a court after a hearing on a treason case in Volgograd, Russia, on Nov. Prosecutors said Sergei Andreev committed the November 2023 attack on instructions from the Ukrainian special services that he received on a messaging app.

Treason and espionage cases have skyrocketed after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The cases have targeted a wide range of suspects, from Kremlin critics and independent journalists to scientists, drawing attention from rights groups.

The legal definition of treason has been expanded to include providing vaguely defined "assistance" to foreign countries or organizations, effectively exposing to prosecution anyone in contact with foreigners.

Remarks
=======

by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with the President of the United States of America, Donald J. Which is totally logical, and this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO Summit, the 5% but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.

  
So based on that, that was Europe stepping up. So if I was Vladimir Putin today, and are you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days, and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. Trump at the White House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   14 Jul. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you do want Europeans to pay for it. I can tell you that at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada: They all want to be part of this.

And this is only the first wave. There will be more.

So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need. So if we can make packages, of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the US will keep on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country, that's absolutely clear.

But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc, etc. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them.

So I really want to thank you for that, and it means Europeans paying for it.

And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the US later, backfilling it, because speed is of the essence here.

So really, thank you this is important.

MOSCOW and KYIV — President Trump on Monday threatened to punish Russia with heavy tariffs on countries that trade with Moscow if the Kremlin fails to reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine by September, while promising Kyiv billions of dollars worth of military equipment.

"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days," Trump said during a White House meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs."

It was his latest warning against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Trump becomes increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin leader over his continued war in Ukraine.

President Trump explained that NATO countries would acquire U.S.-made weapons, including Patriot air defense missile systems, and that those countries would provide them to Ukraine.

Speaking Sunday to reporters ahead of the meeting with Rutte, Trump cast the weapons deals as a direct rebuke to Putin. <image:1883>

 a sanctions on/off switch to use as snap leverage with Moscow.

Collectively, the moves cap a stark turnaround in Trump's approach toward President Putin over the Ukraine issue. Trump's frustrations with Russia today might be directed at Ukraine tomorrow.

"Why should they ruin relations completely?" Sergey Poletaev, of the Moscow-based Vatfor analytical platform, said in an interview with NPR.

"In another six months or so, the pendulum could swing back the other way."

Russia's main market index jumped on the news that Trump would delay additional sanctions for at least 50 days, during which Trump said he expected Russia to negotiate a peace deal.

Yet several prominent Russian nationalists seized on that timeframe, saying it provided Russia a new deadline for a battlefield victory.

Still, political observers in Moscow recalled the Kremlin is dealing with a mercurial American president. Trump has gone from initially promising he could leverage his personal relationship with Putin to negotiate a quick peace agreement, to now openly criticizing the Kremlin leader as unserious in negotiations to end the war.

While NATO's statement did not state a reason for Rutte's trip, it comes after Mr. leader announcing plans to sell NATO allies weapons that it can pass on to Ukraine.

In a statement, NATO said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress.

[! Trump teased last week that he would make a "major statement" on Russia on Monday, as Ukraine struggles to repel massive and complex air assaults launched by Russian forces. 

The president also hinted that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after [pausing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-halting-some-weapons-shipments-ukraine/)
 some weapons shipments.

"We're going to send some more weapons. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine." 

Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.

Graham said he and Blumenthal have support for "congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer" that will "go after" Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and "all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine."

"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine," Graham said. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January.

The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine."

Newsweek AI is in beta. Stoltenberg was ready to start a nuclear war with Russia, and Rutte is the same way."

The false claims also came in the wake of [Trump's advisers telling _The Wall Street Journal_ in an article published Wednesday that the president-elect](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-end-war-1981944)
 "makes his own calls on national-security issues, many times in the moment, particularly on an issue as central as this."

When discussing [his plans for the war in Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-end-war-1981944)
, Trump has previously said that he would end it "within 24 hours" and in addition to pushing for a ceasefire, his advisers "uniformly recommend freezing the war in place."

_Newsweek_ has found that Rutte made no statements regarding the U.S.' alleged expulsion from NATO on his social media platforms, or during a NATO doorstep statement on Thursday in which he congratulated the president-elect.

I will be very brief. I really want to thank you, President of the United States, dear Donald, for the fact that you, as I said before, broke the deadlock, basically, with President Putin by starting that dialog; and I think it was in February that you had the first phone call. We have to stop the destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure. And the fact that you (referring to President Trump) have said “I’m willing to participate in the security guarantees” is a big step."

Since Donald Trump's reelection, claims have circulated on social media that the US will be pushed out of NATO if it fails to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

A claim on social media network Threads alleges that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of NATO, has threatened to expel the US from the alliance if president-elect Donald Trump "surrenders Ukraine to \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin".

The fear that a Trump victory in November's US presidential election could lead to reduced support for Ukraine — or even surrender to the Russian invasion — has long been a concern for NATO and the wider European continent.

Throughout his presidential campaign and even before, Trump was a vocal critic of the support the US was sending to Kyiv and consistently claimed he could quickly end the war once in office, which many have interpreted as him pressuring Ukraine to give up the territory that Russia has occupied in exchange for peace.

Nevertheless, Trump is not yet in power so the current situation has not changed, and there's no evidence that Rutte has said anything about expelling the US from NATO, even if Trump does decide to reduce support.

NATO does not have a specific mechanism to suspend or expel a member. A spokesperson told EuroVerify that it was a "bogus" claim.

Nevertheless, Rutte and other NATO leaders seem keen to stress to Trump that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a danger to the US too, following the president-elect's comments during the campaign that he would withdraw support for Kyiv.

In response to questions from journalists at the EPC summit, Rutte said that any Russian success in Ukraine would not just threaten Europe, but the US too.

"Collectively, we have to work not only the threat of Russia, but also the fact that these four countries \[China, Iran, North Korea and Russia\] work together and that now, very soon, we will see that also the US itself is under threat from these newest technological developments, thanks to Russia giving its latest insights and technology to the North Koreans," he said.

What has Trump previously said about NATO, Russia and Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The worry about Trump's lack of commitment to Ukraine stems from his previous incendiary comments about Kyiv and NATO, in addition to his apparent admiration for Putin.

He has mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's supposed ability to secure US funds, called NATO "obsolete" and has suggested he would not help if Russia tried to invade other NATO allies.

"Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States he walks away with $100 billion, I think he's the greatest salesman on Earth," Trump said during a campaign event in the state of Georgia.

In reality, the US has given around $60 billion (€57 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

At another event at the beginning of the year, the president-elect said that he told "one of the presidents of a big \[NATO\] country" last time he was in office that he would not protect them if they weren't paying their way and Russia attacked.

"In fact, I would encourage them \[Russia\] to do whatever the hell they want," Trump said. The Kremlin denies that this call took place.

If anything, all of Rutte's public statements about Trump since the US presidential election have referred to them working closely together.

Immediately following the election result, which saw Trump triumph over Kamala Harris to win a second term in office, Rutte took to X to say that he had congratulated the incoming president on his victory.

"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong," the former Dutch prime minister said, adding he looked forward to working with him again.

A day later, he posted again on X saying more or less the same, noting that this time he'd personally congratulated Trump.

NATO's website also contains a longer official statement from Rutte.

In the statement, he reminds Trump that "through NATO, the US has 31 friends and allies who help to advance US interests, multiply American power and keep Americans safe".

"President-elect Trump demonstrated strong US leadership throughout his first term in office — a term that turned the tide on European defence spending, improved transatlantic burden sharing, and strengthened Alliance capabilities," Rutte said.

He also said that Trump will see a "stronger, larger, more united alliance" when he takes office again on 20 January, noting that two-thirds of NATO now spend at least 2% of their GDP on defence and that defence spending and production are on an upward trajectory across the alliance.

Trump repeatedly blasted NATO allies last time he was president for not meeting the 2% defence spending target and even suggested raising it to 4%.

As of June this year, out of the 32 NATO members, Croatia, Portugal, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain were the countries not meeting the 2% commitment, according to the most recent figures.

Poland, Estonia and the US were the biggest spenders, sitting at 4.12%, 3.43% and 3.38% respectively.

At a European Political Community (EPC) summit in Budapest earlier in November, Rutte actually credited Trump for NATO's move towards higher defence spending.

"When he was president he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2% and now also thanks to him, in NATO, if you take out the numbers of the US for a moment, is above the 2% and I think very much that is his doing, his success, and we need to do more," Rutte told journalists.

Russian victory threatens US as much as Europe
----------------------------------------------

For good measure, NATO itself has denied that Rutte ever threatened to expel the US. You got to pay your bills."

In February 2022, Trump praised Putin as a "genius" and "savvy" for the way he launched the invasion.

However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump rang Putin shortly after his reelection to warn him against escalating the war."

Trump at the White House, discussing support for Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Mark Rutte, the NATO Secretary General, met with Donald Trump to discuss support for Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not contain any statements from Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:439>

Mexico’s President-elect Sheinbaum turns down Zelensky’s invitation to Ukraine

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

! Zelensky also expressed his hope that Mexico, under Sheinbaum’s leadership, would clearly distance itself from Russia.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. He expressed disappointment over Mexico's inclusion of Russian military personnel in its Independence Day parade and called for recognition of Ukraine’s struggle for independence. "Our Constitution is very clear, noble, and pacifist," she said.

Throughout his tenure, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) maintained a balanced stance on the Ukraine conflict, condemning Russia’s invasion while criticising the US for sending arms to Ukraine. Mexico has also refused to impose sanctions on Russia and declined to send military aid to Ukraine, despite requests from Ukrainian officials.

Nevertheless, it has played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

[Mexican President-elect declines Zelenskyy’s invitation to visit Ukraine](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/)

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Kyiv after taking office on 1 October, Fuser News reports.

Sheinbaum [stated](https://fusernews.com/nuestra-responsabilidad-es-aqui-sheinbaum-rechaza-invitacion-a-ucrania/)
 her intention to maintain a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, continuing the approach of her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine and adheres to a policy of neutrality regarding the war. Ukraine and the EU have pressured Mexico over its approach to Russia, especially after inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin to the upcoming presidential inauguration despite his ICC arrest warrant.

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico has [called](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/08/08/ukraine-calls-on-mexico-to-arrest-putin-during-mexican-presidents-inauguration/?swcfpc=1)
 on local authorities to detain Putin if he visits, as Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. On 8 August, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said that the European Union had also urged Mexico to arrest Putin if he arrives in the country.

Mexico has rejected a request from Ukraine to arrest the Russian President if he attends the inauguration of Mexico’s next president on 1 October.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of abducting and forcibly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Since then, the Russian leader has avoided traveling to countries that have signed the Rome Statute due to the threat of arrest.

She added that Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with all countries except Ecuador, where an embassy attack in April was deemed a “violation of sovereignty.”

In August, Russian media reported that Mexico had invited Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration on October 1, 2024.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico has urged Mexican authorities to arrest Putin if he visits, citing his war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court, which Mexico recognizes.

López Obrador had previously rejected Ukraine’s request to arrest Putin.

Content: "‘war on drugs’ as poison to Mexico.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum made this statement — “Start with your own country” — during her regular morning press conference Feb. In the cities of the United States, who sells the drugs that have wreaked such tragedy?”

President Sheinbaum knows what she is talking about, especially if one considers who the big winner is in the drug business. The secrets of drug trafficking, from Colombia to Chicago” — states that there are some 20 million drug users in the United States, of which some 6 million are addicts; however, it is dangerous to talk about the subject, so it is avoided, leading to total ignorance and confusion and the easy construction of stereotypes aimed at blaming the scourge exclusively on the producing countries.

Fernández Menéndez and Ronquillo explain that, after the shipments have crossed the border using all kinds of transport and also through tunnels along the entire border area, the drug trafficking networks begin to operate from 14 cities in the south in the states of New Mexico, Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida and Louisiana, where the drugs are smuggled. In the continuation of the controversy and in defense of Mexico’s best interests, three days later Sheinbaum reiterated that the United States must take responsibility for the serious problem of drug trafficking and drug consumption in its country.

The Mexican president explained that drug trafficking arises from the demand for drugs; as long as there is consumption, there will be supply. In this area, she insisted that the United States must also take charge of controlling its own generators of violence and domestic production of psychotropic substances and must make an effort to monitor and intervene in its illegal internal market.

It must also be said Claudia Sheinbaum showed her indomitable will and patriotic feeling in the conversation she had with the U.S. 7, Sheinbaum reported that she told Trump that it was crucial in the fight against drug trafficking that weapons from the U.S. But today, there are several countries and governments that support and defend the dignity and honor of their peoples.

Claudia Sheinbaum, just like the priests Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, just like Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas, is giving continuity to policies to recover decorum and consciousness of Mexican sovereignty initiated in this century by Andrés Manuel López Obrador. government’s use of the “war on drugs” as a pretext for intervention and exposes inconsistencies in Washington’s propaganda. The Mexican president then said: “They have a lot to do in the United States,” and asked, “How does fentanyl or any other drug get there? Already at the end of the 20th century, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated the profit produced by international drug trafficking at close to $500 billion, more than half of which circulated through the U.S."

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [pointed that out last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-president-tells-trump-tariffs-will-worsen-inflation-kill-jobs-2024-11-26/)
 in response to Trump’s claim that he’ll address this country’s fentanyl problem by putting a tariff on Mexican imports. 4, 2024, 6:06 PM EST

By [Julio Ricardo Varela](https://www.msnbc.com/author/julio-ricardo-varela-ncpn297186)
, MSNBC Columnist

Much of President-elect Donald Trump’s rise to power can be linked to [his blaming Mexico for America’s problems](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-tariffs-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-rcna181923)
. We do not consume synthetic drugs,” Sheinbaum said. When he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015, he claimed [Mexico was mostly “sending” criminals](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-6-most-provocative-parts-donald-trumps-2016-announcement-msna619371)
, including drug dealers and rapists, to the U.S., and [he promised to build a wall](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-immigration-mass-deportation-rcna179782)
 to keep migrants out. Now, his threat to [impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-threats-day-one-trade-tariffs-matter-rcna181793)
 is based in part on the idea that Mexico is the cause of the United States’ fentanyl addiction and to blame for a migrant crisis.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless. It riles up the nativism in his MAGA followers and gives them the scapegoat they crave.

But that ignores that the United States is the world’s most lucrative illegal drug market, [estimated at $150 billion yearly](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/08/20.html)
 for the most common drugs, along with an [increasing use of fentanyl](https://time.com/6977717/fentanyl-pills-seized-study/)
. “Unfortunately, what we do have is the people who are being killed by the crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”

Drugs aren’t the only thing that U.S. Mexico also has enforced new visa requirements for those from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and increased expulsions.”

That all happened under then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his successor, Sheinbaum, [told Trump last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-mexico-president-sheinbaum-immigration-rcna182119)
 “that caravans weren’t arriving at the northern border because they are being served in Mexico.” In other words, Mexico continues to be the United States’ real southern border wall. This, despite Sheinbaum’s claim that “Mexico’s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.” That might sound noble, but Mexico has benefited from being a complicit immigration enforcement partner with the U.S. That type of attitude led [to successes in decreasing drug fatalities](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-overdose-opioid-epidemic-rcna182059)
 during the Biden administration."

United States President Donald Trump thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drugs campaign, on which he pledged to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

[Speaking at a Saudi Arabia-backed investment conference in Miami](https://x.com/jenarovillamil/status/1892377901682589986?s=46)
, Trump said he had spoken to Sheinbaum about drugs and she told him that Mexico is not a “consumer nation.”

> [#ULTIMAHORA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ULTIMAHORA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> . — his “sweeping freeze on foreign aid has temporarily stopped U.S.-funded anti-narcotics programs in Mexico that for years have been working to curb the flow of the synthetic opioid into the United States,” [Reuters said in an exclusive report last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-stops-anti-fentanyl-work-mexico-2025-02-13/)
.

**‘Fentanyl kills’: Mexico’s anti-drug campaign**
-------------------------------------------------

In early January, [Sheinbaum officially presented a 300-million-peso (US $14.8 million) “national” and “permanent” anti-drugs campaign](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-presenta-campana-preventiva-nacional-y-permanente-alejate-de-las-drogas-el-fentanilo-te-mata)
 under the name “Aléjate de las drogas. (CBP Troy Miller/X)

The government of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador [also ran an anti-drugs campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/fruitless-anti-drug-abuse-campaign/)
, and in early 2023 then deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell was [announced as Mexico’s new addiction prevention “czar.”](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lopez-gatell-addiction-czar/)

The current and former anti-drugs campaigns have [faced criticism for a range of reasons](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
, including because of the focus on fentanyl, which — as Sheinbaum has pointed out — is not widely used in Mexico, and because they have allegedly aroused interest in the synthetic opioid among users of other drugs.

“The main drug problem in Mexico is the use of methamphetamines,” [the news website Expansión reported earlier this month](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
.

Health Minister David Kershenobich said last month that was “probably” the case, although he said that fentanyl “is the most significant” drug used in Mexico “in the sense of mortality and the harm it causes.”

Have something to say? President Donald Trump, who said Sheinbaum inspired his new anti-drug campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump-696x464.jpg "sheinbaum-trump")](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump.jpg)

Despite her status as 'the world's leading Trump whisperer,' President Sheinbaum and U.S. We have great family values,'” Trump said.

He noted that Sheinbaum — who he referred to as a “very wonderful woman” — also told him that Mexico spends a lot of money on anti-drug advertising.

“And I said ‘unbelievable.’ That was such a great conversation because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — \[we’re going to say\] that they chew up your brain, they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. … We’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you,” he said.

Trump didn’t say exactly when he spoke to Sheinbaum about Mexico’s anti-drug advertising campaign.

Sheinbaum [said on social media in late November](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-responds-trump-claim-stop-migration-close-border/)
 that she had spoken to Trump about “the campaign we’re carrying out in the country to prevent the use of fentanyl.”

The U.S. Stay away from drugs, choose to be happy,” [says one video advertisement](https://x.com/SSalud_mx/status/1890611998871704013/video/1)
.

On the day the “Stay away from drugs campaign” was officially launched, [Sheinbaum asserted that the use of fentanyl “is not really a problem” in Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-fentanyl/)
.

While [fentanyl is used in Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fentanyl-use-spreads-deeper-into-mexico-worrying-authorities-2024-02-20/)
 and there have been deaths linked to the powerful synthetic opioid here, “there is not a crisis like there is in the United States,” she said.

“… We don’t want \[the overdose crisis\] to reach our country, and that’s why we’re starting this campaign against fentanyl,” Sheinbaum said.

Claim: "Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to Ukraine by Volodymr Zelenskyy and said towards him on September 17, 2024: 'If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana.'"

## Actions
```
web_search("Claudia Sheinbaum Zelenskyy Ukraine invitation")
web_search("Claudia Sheinbaum Tijuana drug addict quote")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources ([IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/mexico-s-president-elect-sheinbaum-turns-down-zelensky-s-invitation-to-ukraine-344262/), [Euromaidan Press](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/), and [NV.ua](https://english.nv.ua/nation/sheinbaum-declines-zelenskyy-s-invitation-focuses-on-domestic-issues-50451798.html/)) report that Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican President-elect, declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Ukraine. Sheinbaum intends to focus on internal affairs and maintain a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs. <image:439> <image:453> <image:455>

The articles were published in September 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web search results discuss Claudia Sheinbaum's statements on drug trafficking and the U.S.'s role in it. One article from workers.org ([Source](https://www.workers.org/2025/02/83990/)) highlights Sheinbaum's emphasis on U.S. responsibility for drug consumption and trafficking. An MSNBC article ([Source](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-fentanyl-response-rcna182496)) mentions Sheinbaum's response to Donald Trump's claims about Mexico's role in the fentanyl crisis, stating that Mexico does not consume synthetic drugs.

Mexico News Daily ([Source](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/trump-sheinbaum-us-anti-drug-campaign/)) reports that Donald Trump thanked Claudia Sheinbaum for inspiring the launch of a US anti-drug campaign. <image:9503>, <image:9505>, <image:9516>, <image:9519>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, the provided search results do not contain any information about the alleged quote attributed to her.

Therefore, the veracity of the second part of the claim cannot be determined based on the available evidence. More information is needed to verify the statement.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to Ukraine is supported by multiple sources. However, the claim includes a quote attributed to her that cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The search results do not contain any information about the alleged quote.

The decision option that best applies is `false`.

 By the end of the first week, the Ukrainian military said it had captured 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi) of Russian territory, while Russian authorities acknowledged that Ukraine had captured 28 settlements.[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)

On 7 September, [Kyrylo Budanov](/wiki/Kyrylo_Budanov "Kyrylo Budanov")

### United States

 On 8 August, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary [Sabrina Singh](/wiki/Sabrina_Singh "Sabrina Singh")

 On 12 August, [US National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")

 said that the Ukrainian incursion was "creating a real dilemma" for Putin.[\[337\]](#cite_note-339)

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct. It said "the absence of any significant military units of the Russian Federation on the border at the time of the attack and the simultaneous continuous conduct of aggressive military operations for more than 900 days on the territory of sovereign Ukraine is the best proof that Putin is lying again about 'protecting Russia.' He doesn't care about Russia, he is only protecting himself."[\[59\]](#cite_note-cnn-conscripts-61)

[NATO](/wiki/NATO "NATO")
 Secretary-General [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg")
 called the Ukrainian incursion "legitimate" and within Kyiv's right to self-defense, adding that the bloc did not receive prior information about the operation and did not play a role in it.[\[346\]](#cite_note-348)

### Evaluation of the offensive

The _BBC_ reported that the August 2024 offensive was the first incidence since [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 that Russian territory had been occupied by foreign forces (although other sources state that foreign jihadists occupied some Russian territory during the [War in Dagestan](/wiki/War_in_Dagestan_(1999) "War in Dagestan (1999)")
 in 1999).[\[347\]](#cite_note-349)
[\[348\]](#cite_note-350)
 The incursion has been dubbed the "second battle of Kursk", in allusion to [the 1943 battle](/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk "Battle of Kursk")
 in the same region.[\[349\]](#cite_note-351)
[\[350\]](#cite_note-352)
 The offensive is also larger than earlier ground raids, with at least two [brigades](/wiki/Brigade "Brigade")
 from the regular Ukrainian forces participating. Finally, on the strategic level, to slow Russia's offensive momentum, to shift the narrative and counter Russian talking points about their inevitable victory, and also to boost Ukrainian morale.[\[355\]](#cite_note-357)

Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
, former chief of staff at the German [Federal Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Defence_(Germany) "Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)")
, stated that the incursion was likely "to establish a [negotiating position](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 and provide relief on other front lines" and that it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces would hold territory in Kursk for long periods of time.[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 Retired Polish General and former commander of special forces, [Roman Polko](/wiki/Roman_Polko "Roman Polko")
, stated that "It's good that Ukraine is taking actions that surprise the Russians," and that "Ukraine is in a defensive position and is unable to conduct an operation to push Russia from the occupied regions, but Ukraine is defending itself in an active way," and that "One can't allow the Russians to comfortably prepare new attacks."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Political analyst [Andreas Umland](/wiki/Andreas_Umland "Andreas Umland")
 suggested that the offensive could bring a quicker end to the war. Kiviselg said that the Russian counterattack in Kursk had "not made significant progress" and had suffered losses, but speculated that the Russian movement may have simply been a probing attack and not the main offensive effort.[\[366\]](#cite_note-368)

By 2 October 2024, nearly two months since the incursion, it was widely agreed that the operation in Kursk had a direct relation with the degradation of Ukraine's eastern front.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Ukraine suffered its steepest loss in territory between mid-August to mid-September, which also coincided with Ukraine's incursion into Kursk according to Pasi Paroinen, analyst of the Black Bird Group.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Rob Lee further supported his earlier argument, stressing that Kursk had stretched Ukrainian personnel thin, added pressure on units holding the line and exacerbated the manpower issues in Ukraine, which is further made worse with heavy losses of experienced Ukrainian soldiers, coupled with new troops sped to the front with limited training.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)

By 20 November 2024, three months into the incursion, Marina Miron, a defence researcher at [King's College London](/wiki/King%27s_College_London "King's College London")
, declared the entire operation to be a costly, strategic failure for Ukraine. Kofman assessed that by early February 2025, the salient created by the offensive had become impossible to hold as Russia had increasingly been able to hinder the use of supply routes.[\[13\]](#cite_note-kursk_gambit_20250401-14)
[\[368\]](#cite_note-370)
 According to another military analyst, Steen Kjærgaard, the US cutting intelligence sharing with Ukraine on 5 March played a major role in Russians retaking Sudzha, with Ukraine lacking information on Russian troop movements.[\[369\]](#cite_note-d947-371)
 Richard Kemp from _[The Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")
_ viewed the entire Kursk operation to be a defeat for Ukraine, as Ukraine had lost any "bargaining chip" to trade land for land in any ceasefire negotiations.[\[370\]](#cite_note-Telegraph-372)
 Former military advisor [Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
 viewed the operation as a success.[\[371\]](#cite_note-:0-373)
 Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert with the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 said that he hesitated to say that the effort by Ukraine was a strategic mistake, that Ukraine had held the Sudzha pocket for a "remarkable" amount of time, and that the Ukrainian offensive had had a "shaping effect on Russian thinking".[\[45\]](#cite_note-guardian_20250310-47)
 On 26 April 2025, the ISW said that the Ukrainian operation succeeded in diverting some Russian "elite" units from Donbas, but its long-term effects remain to be seen.[\[372\]](#cite_note-374)

The attack reportedly pushed up [natural gas prices](/wiki/Natural_gas_prices "Natural gas prices")

Content: "This means looking at more sanctions and specifically not allowing them (Russia) to participate in international bodies like the Executive Council of the OPCW (the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons),” Brekelmans said.

The OPCW said last year that Russian and Ukrainian accusations that the other side was using banned weapons were “insufficiently substantiated”.

The disarmament agency, which is based in The Hague and has 193 member states, has not conducted a full investigation, something which can only happen at the request of member states.

Fighting grinds on
------------------

The allegations of increased Russian chemical weapons use came as Ukraine reported the largest ever [Russian drone and missile attack](/news/2025/7/4/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1226)
 on the country.

A Ukrainian air force official told local media it is the biggest of the war so far, with Moscow firing 539 drones and 11 missiles overnight.

The attacks on Kyiv injured at least 23 people, damaging railway infrastructure and setting buildings and cars on fire, authorities said.

A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Rostov region killed at least one woman and forced the evacuation of dozens of people from their homes, the acting governor said.

In the meantime, on Friday, both countries confirmed that they had carried out their latest prisoner exchange, with neither side giving details about the number of soldiers involved.

The swap followed an agreement made in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, in June.

On the diplomatic front, United States President Donald Trump said he had made no progress, expressing his “disappointment”, during his phone call on Thursday with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who reportedly [reiterated](/news/2025/7/3/russia-will-not-back-down-on-ukraine-war-goals-putin-tells-trump)
 he would stop his invasion only if the conflict’s “root causes” were tackled.

Trump also said he was planning to discuss the conflict with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. ![Ukraine trenches](/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reuters_6867afc4-1751625668.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers in a serious violation of international law, the Dutch and German intelligence agencies have said.

On Friday, they said there was extensive evidence that Moscow’s forces were using banned products, including the choking agent chloropicrin.

Russia denies using the prohibited weapons, as does Ukraine. Chloropicrin is dropped by drones to drive soldiers out of trenches, and then kill them,” Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in a post on X, referring to Russia’s purported use.

Brekelmans, who is now calling for tougher sanctions against Russia, described the use of chemical weapons as “horrible and unacceptable”.

Peter Reesink, the head of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), confirmed that the findings were based on its own investigations. There were “thousands of instances” of chemical weapons use by Russia, he said.

“This isn’t just some ad hoc tinkering at the front line; it is truly part of a large-scale programme. And that is, of course, also concerning because if we don’t clarify and publicise what Russia is doing, it’s highly likely these trends will continue,” Reesink added.

Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency also corroborated the MIVD’s conclusions.

The Russian army was using tear gas as well as “the more dangerous chemical chloropicrin, which can be lethal in high concentrations in enclosed spaces” in Ukraine, the BND said in a statement.

“This represents a more serious violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of this lung warfare agent under all circumstances,” it noted.

Speaking to Reuters about the Dutch and German intelligence reports, Brekelmans, the Dutch defence minister, said that at least three Ukrainian deaths had been linked to Russian chemical weapons, with more than 2,500 people reporting symptoms related to the banned products.

More needed to be done to deter Russia from deploying such weapons, he suggested.

“We must further increase the pressure. Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump about the supply of US [weapons to Ukraine](/news/2025/7/2/us-halts-some-weapons-shipments-to-ukraine)
.

The US said on Tuesday that it was halting some weapons deliveries to Kyiv that were promised under the Biden administration, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine.

The Biden administration-era pledges, which included various munitions to bolster Ukraine’s defences, are now under review as the Pentagon reassesses current inventory levels."

Bolstered By North Korean Troops, Russia Presses Attacks in Kursk Region

Print

KYIV -- Moscow's forces, bolstered by **[North Korean troops](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-war-north-korea-kursk/33239998.html)
**, have intensified their offensive against Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region, as Kyiv's outnumbered soldiers attempted to resist the onslaught there and elsewhere on December 17.

"For the third day, the enemy has been conducting intensive offensive operations on the territory of the Kursk region, actively using units of the North Korean Army," said General Oleksandr Syrskiy, Ukraine's top military commander, in an address broadcast online.

Pyongyang’s decision to send troops to Russia appears to have come at a high cost so far.

Bolstered By North Korean Troops, Russia Presses Attacks in Kursk Region
========================================================================

December 17, 2024 17:39 CET Updated December 17, 2024 23:07 CET

*   By [RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service](/author/rfe-rls-ukrainian-service/guv_qt "RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service")

!A Russian soldier aims a D-30 howitzer toward Ukrainian positions in the border area of Kursk region, Russia, in early December. Russia has not commented on the reports.

Syrskiy said the situation all along the front line "remains difficult" after Russian troops had seized "the strategic initiative" in recent weeks.

He said Russian forces were continuing their drive to **[capture the strategic Donetsk city of Pokrovsk](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-war-pokrovsk/33241843.html)
**, which appears to be mostly deserted by civilians.

Local military commanders in the region said defense forces were "holding back the onslaught," although the overall situation in the Donetsk city -- with a prewar population of about 65,000 -- appeared perilous, according to many Ukrainian officials.

Over recent months, Russia has pressed its manpower advantage to push back against Ukraine's shock incursion into its Kursk region in August and to gain territory in eastern Ukraine, prompting Ukrainian officials to increase pleas to Western partners for additional military aid.

Elsewhere, Ukraine's SBU security service said it had uncovered a "large-scale network" of agents working for Russian military intelligence that had attempted to collect information on Ukraine's supply of Western-supplied F-16 warplanes, which are based at secret sites throughout the country.

"As a result of the special operation, 12 Russian agents and their informants were exposed. Its comprehensive coverage also includes award-winning reporting by the Donbas.Realities and Crimea.Realities projects and the Schemes investigative unit.

LG officials on December 16 said North Korean troops have been **[fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-north-korean-soldiers-killed-russia-kursk/33241393.html)
** and that some have been killed or injured.

On December 17, a senior U.S. military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told news agencies that North Korean forces have suffered "several hundred" casualties in the Kursk fighting -- from lower-level troops to those "very near to the top."

"These are not battle-hardened troops. They haven't been in combat before," the official added.

RFE/RL has not been able to independently verify the claims. President-elect Donald Trump told a news conference that Zelenskiy and Russia's Vladimir Putin must be prepared to "make a deal" to end the "horrible" war in Ukraine.

"He should be prepared to make a deal, that’s all," Trump said of Zelenskiy during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

Putin must also "make a deal," Trump then added.

"Got to be a deal."

----------- So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Any US assistance is expected to come in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward."

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 proposed in November 2022 a 10-point peace plan,[\[26\]](#cite_note-kp10point-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-ajz1-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
 consisting of:

*   A ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine
*   Restoration of Ukraine's borders prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea
*   Release of prisoners and return of [Ukrainian children deported to Russia](/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "Child abductions in the Russo-Ukrainian War")
    
*   Protection and restoration of [Ukraine's energy infrastructure](/wiki/Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure_(2022%E2%80%93present) "Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)")
    
*   Protection of [food distribution](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_food_crises#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "2022–2023 food crises")
    
*   Nuclear safety, including transfer of [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant](/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant_crisis "Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant crisis")
     to the [IAEA](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency")
    
*   Environmental safety, including [demining](/wiki/Demining "Demining")
     and remediation of ecological damage caused by the [destruction of the Kakhovka Dam](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam "Destruction of the Kakhovka Dam")

*   Security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future aggression
*   A multilateral peace conference and peace treaty

Two months before the invasion, Ukrainian Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 dismissed the idea that declaring [neutrality](/wiki/Neutral_country "Neutral country")
 would prevent Russian aggression. The agreement was however blocked by Putin, who "expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory".[\[21\]](#cite_note-Reuters14092022-21)
 A Kremlin spokesman denied the story.[\[47\]](#cite_note-moscowtimes-deal-47)

### Belarus and Antalya peace talks

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 and Belarusian president [Alexander Lukashenko](/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko "Alexander Lukashenko")
 agreed on 27 February that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with Russian officials in Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, without preconditions.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)
 It was reported that Lukashenko assured Zelenskyy that all planes, helicopters, and missiles on Belarusian territory would remain on the ground during the negotiations.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

Talks began on 28 February at one of Lukashenko's countryside residences near Liaskavičy, about 30 miles from the [Belarus-Ukraine border](/wiki/Belarus-Ukraine_border "Belarus-Ukraine border")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Ukrainian delegation was led by [Davyd Arakhamia](/wiki/Davyd_Arakhamia "Davyd Arakhamia")
 and included defense minister [Oleksii Reznikov](/wiki/Oleksii_Reznikov "Oleksii Reznikov")
, presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
, and others. The Ukrainians wanted a peacetime army of 250,000; the Russians demanded a maximum of 85,000, which is much smaller than the standing army Ukraine had before the invasion.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Russians also demanded severe limits on the amount and kinds of weaponry Ukraine could have, without any limits on Russia's military.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)

A third disagreement was the Russians' new demands for Ukraine to revoke several of its domestic laws, dealing with [contentious aspects of Soviet-era history](/wiki/Decolonization_in_Ukraine "Decolonization in Ukraine")
, such as the role of Ukrainian nationalists in World War II. Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](/wiki/Antony_Blinken "Antony Blinken")
 insisted that Ukraine continue fighting in response to Milley's statement.[\[128\]](#cite_note-128)
 Ukraine presented the detailed [10-point peace proposal](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 later in November at a [G20](/wiki/G20 "G20")
 meeting.[\[129\]](#cite_note-AJE_Zelenskyy_10pt_plan-129)
 In December, Ukrainian foreign minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 suggested a February 2023 peace summit at the UN mediated by secretary-general [António Guterres](/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres")
 to which Russia would only be invited if it faced an international court for war crimes.[\[130\]](#cite_note-ap221226-130)
 Later that month, Russian officials said it would only resume peace talks with Ukraine if it recognized Russian sovereignty over the annexed regions.[\[22\]](#cite_note-voa221230-22)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-131)
 Peskov said in January 2023 that "there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine."[\[132\]](#cite_note-132)

[\[137\]](#cite_note-137)
 At the [UN General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
, China's deputy ambassador to the UN proposed a plan involving a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians, and the upholding of territorial integrity; China also said that the West had exacerbated the conflict by supplying Ukraine with weaponry.[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
 Zelenskyy said that "I plan to meet Xi Jinping and believe this will be beneficial for our countries and for security in the world", though a time or place for a meeting was not set.[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 The spokeswoman of Russia's foreign ministry, [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")
, said Russia appreciated China's efforts to resolve the conflict and was "open to achieving the goals of the [special military operation](/wiki/Special_military_operation "Special military operation")
 by political and diplomatic means" but that it would entail recognising the "new territorial realities" of Russia's annexations.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
 Peskov said that for now, we don't see any of the conditions that are needed to bring this whole story towards peace."[\[142\]](#cite_note-chinese-peskov-142)

Chinese foreign minister [Qin Gang](/wiki/Qin_Gang "Qin Gang")
 said sanctions and political pressure would not resolve the conflict, which he said "seems to be driven by an invisible hand pushing for the protraction and escalation", and that "the process of peace talks should begin as soon as possible".[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
 Xi said that China's peace proposal reflected world opinion ahead of [his visit to Russia on 20–22 March 2023](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")
.[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 Blinken responded by saying "the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms."[\[145\]](#cite_note-guardian230321-145)
 On 26 April 2023, over a month after Xi's summit with Putin, Xi Jinping held a phone call with Zelenskyy.[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)
 The Chinese readout of the Xi–Zelenskyy call included little concrete information about the start of a peace process;[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)
 in May, European officials criticized China's peace plan as an attempt at "freezing" the conflict in place and splitting the West in pushing Ukraine to a ceasefire.[\[148\]](#cite_note-wsj230526-148)
 Earlier, Peskov had said that Russia has "to achieve our goals" and that "Right now this is only possible by military means."[\[149\]](#cite_note-149)

In April 2023, some Ukrainian officials said they would be willing to discuss the status of Crimea.[\[150\]](#cite_note-150)
[\[151\]](#cite_note-foreignpol230411-151)
 That month, Brazilian president [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva "Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva")
 suggested that Ukraine should "give up Crimea" in exchange for Russian withdrawal from all territory it has occupied since February 2022.[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity but said that Zelenskyy "cannot want everything";[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
[\[153\]](#cite_note-153)
 he said Brazil advocates a "negotiated political solution to the conflict" and expressed concern over "global consequences" of the war "in terms of [food](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises "2022–2023 global food crises")
 and energy security".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Brazilian foreign policy adviser [Celso Amorim](/wiki/Celso_Amorim "Celso Amorim")
 said "the ideal peace for the Ukrainians and the Russians" required "concessions".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Ukraine rejected Lula's proposal.[\[155\]](#cite_note-155)
 Lula said after visiting China that "the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace", to which U.S. Petersburg, Russian president Vladimir Putin rejected a ceasefire and peace talks with Ukraine due to the ongoing [Ukrainian counter-offensive](/wiki/2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive "2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive")

 Prior to the summit [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")
, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said there would be discussions on the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which "contains 10 fundamental points, the implementation of which will not only ensure peace for Ukraine, but also create mechanisms to counter future conflicts in the world".[\[183\]](#cite_note-183)
 After the summit no joint statement was issued.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
 The participants did agree to create working groups to develop details of key themes prominent in Zelenskyy's proposed peace plan (that calls for Russian troops to withdraw from all of Ukraine's territory as part of a peace deal) while a parallel ambassadors group would continue technical work on the issues.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)

 According to Lavrov one of the Russian security interest was "the need to prevent the creation of a hostile Nazi regime near Russian borders."[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 Lavrov also said that Russia did not see "any serious proposals from the West" and he argued that they were promoting [Ukrainian president](/wiki/Ukrainian_president "Ukrainian president")

 has ditched his call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, backing instead Russian President Vladimir Putin’s push for a permanent peace agreement. And my response to that is: That’s the point,” Pizzi said.

Ad Feedback But they understand that the kind of deal sought by Russia can’t happen unless the most basic principle underpinning the global order – that a country cannot get what it wants by force – is thrown under the bus.

And Kyiv’s European allies are not willing to risk that, not least because they could well become the next target of Russia’s aggression.

Speaking to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and several European leaders in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump adopted some of Moscow’s talking points, questioning whether a ceasefire was “necessary” if a broader peace deal could be achieved.

But international law experts and analysts say that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be completely illegal under the UN Charter, a key international agreement which most countries signed up to after the horrors of the Second World War.

While often thought of as essentially the same thing, there is a big difference between a peace deal and a ceasefire in the eyes of international law.

During a ceasefire, warring parties agree to stop fighting with each side keeping hold of the territory under its military control. So what that also (means) is that any treaty that you procure by use of force is effectively illegal and is inherently void,” said Jeremy Pizzi, an international lawyer and a legal adviser of Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation.

Little detail has been shared about the kind of peace deal Putin discussed with Trump last week, but it is clear that the Russian leader has not abandoned some of his maximalist demands, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, and is banned from joining NATO in the future.

This would make the deal doubly illegal under international law: illegal because of the way it would be reached – by force – and illegal because of its content.

But even if he wanted to – which he does not – Zelensky cannot agree to give up territory.

Under the Ukrainian constitution, any change to the country’s borders must be approved by a referendum – a rule that is in place partly because of Russia’s tendency to install puppet governments in foreign countries.

A survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), a leading public opinion pollster, in May and June found that the vast majority of Ukrainians reject the idea of recognizing Ukrainian territories as part of Russia. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\

And, crucially, even if Kyiv were to recognize that the reality on the ground gives Russia the de-facto control of some of its land, it would certainly not agree to make this a permanent recognition. That has not stopped some [European leaders](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-ukraine-zelensky-russia-putin-08-18-25)
 from pushing for a temporary truce first, even though the US president has seemingly decided one is not necessary.

It’s not that [Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and its allies don’t want peace. But the understanding is that the pause is temporary – usually to provide a window to negotiate, deliver humanitarian help or evacuate civilians.

Kyiv and its European allies suggested that a ceasefire might be a precursor for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who attended the summit on Monday, said that he “can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire.”

A ceasefire can be short – like the 1914 Christmas Truce that lasted a few days – or it could stretch to decades. The prohibition of using armed force to conquer territory is absolute under international law,” Pizzi said.

No ‘sensible reason to trust Russia’
------------------------------------

There are also practical and strategic reasons why Ukraine cannot agree to Moscow’s demands.

The Russian military currently controls almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk, which means that Putin is asking Kyiv to give up even more than it has lost so far.

But the parts of the Donbas region that are still under Kyiv’s control include infrastructure that is crucial for Ukraine’s defense. If they were to be taken by Russia, the road to the western parts of the country would be wide open.

There is also little incentive for Kyiv to trust Moscow, Pizzi said.

“Russia has engaged in armed attacks against Ukraine for over 10 years now, consistently, repeatedly during that time. Russia has feigned negotiations, feigned good faith, while continuing to use violence and keeping up the same illegal maximalist goals in the background and Ukrainian authorities are painfully aware of this,” he said.

“There is no logical, sensible reason to trust Russia in the absence of a precursor, a good faith decision or engagement that they make on their part to hold off from killing more Ukrainians,” he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that peace talks and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian and CNN articles from August 2025, along with the Wikipedia entry, indicate discussions and meetings related to a potential peace deal. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

The evidence mentions a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, and a Putin-Trump call in 2025, which implies that negotiations were in progress. The articles also discuss the complexities of reaching a peace deal, including the difference between a ceasefire and a peace agreement.

Therefore, while the evidence confirms that peace talks were happening in 2025, it does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, including a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025 (<image:4898>). CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>).

The Wikipedia article also mentions a 2025 Putin-Trump call.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace talks and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025.

Therefore, while the evidence confirms that peace talks were happening in 2025, it does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Ukraine is 'not interested in a sustainable, fair, long-term settlement' \[Alexander Zemlianichenko/Reuters\]

Published On 21 Aug 202521 Aug 2025

Russia has said that Ukraine was “not interested” in a long-term peace deal, accusing it of seeking security guarantees incompatible with Russia’s demands.

“The Ukrainian regime and its representatives comment on the current situation in a very specific way, directly showing that they are not interested in a sustainable, fair, long-term settlement,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference on Thursday.

Lavrov also repeated Russia’s policy that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to meet with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy – but only after key issues have previously been worked out by senior officials in what could be a long negotiating process.

His comments came as Zelenskyy announced he could meet with Putin, but only after his allies agree to security guarantees for Ukraine to deter future Russian attacks once the fighting stops.

In comments released on Thursday, Zelenskyy also warned that both sides were preparing for further fighting. Russia was building up troops on the southern front line and Ukraine was test-launching a new long-range cruise missile, he said.

US President Donald Trump is trying to end Russia’s three-and-a-half-year invasion of Ukraine through talks with Zelenskyy and Putin.

While he has upended a years-long Western policy of isolating the Russian leader, he has made little tangible progress towards a peace deal.

Trump said in comments posted on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that the war would have “never happened” if he was in office at the time of Russia’s invasion.

“Zero chance,” Trump wrote, adding: “Interesting times ahead,” without elaborating further.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January and began pushing for an end to the fighting, Russian forces have continued to slowly but steadily [gain ground](/news/2025/8/19/ukraine-hit-by-multiple-russian-strikes-amid-us-led-push-for-end-to-war)
 across the front line.

Zelenskyy, in his comments to reporters, said Ukraine wants to have “an understanding of the security guarantees architecture within seven to 10 days”.

“We need to understand which country will be ready to do what at each specific moment,” he added.

Ukraine allies led by the United Kingdom and France are putting together a military coalition to support the guarantees. Lavrov warned that any deployment of European troops to the country would be “absolutely unacceptable”.

Once an outline of the security guarantees is agreed, Trump would like to see a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian leader said.

But any meeting with the Russian leader should be held in a “neutral” European country, he added, ruling out any summit in Moscow.

He also rejected the idea of China playing a role in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security, citing Beijing’s alleged support for Moscow.

Zelenskyy has said the only way to end the war is a meeting with Putin, and has said Trump should be present, too.

But Moscow has played down the prospect of a summit between Putin and Zelenskyy any time soon, insisting it needs to be [included in discussions](/news/2025/8/20/russia-says-ukraine-security-guarantees-talks-must-include-moscow)

White’s sister, Kelly Kneale, [told The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)
 she doesn’t believe there’s a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing.

“I don’t believe it was targeted,” she told the publication. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White’s vehicle, when he interrupted them.”

White, who started working for Infowars around 2021, wrote stories praising President Donald Trump and attacking Democrats.

“Everybody needs to start carrying guns,” Jones added.

 and his supporters are now alleging that an Infowars reporter who was killed outside of his home in Austin, [Texas](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Texas)
, was murdered by [Ukrainian](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Ukraine)
 forces in a targeted hit, giving rise to yet another conspiracy theory that officials have cast doubt upon.

Infowars reporter Jamie White, 36, was found lying on the ground in a parking lot outside of his apartment complex with gunshot wounds, according to Austin police. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle, when he interrupted them," said the police statement.

Jones, Infowars' founder, said the killing "could've been a hit" while being interviewed by conservative commentator Benny Johnson.

"What are the chances in a town of over two million people that an Infowars lead reporter gets butchered?" Jones inquired, despite Austin having a population of less than one million residents.

He continued to allege that White was on a Ukrainian hit list alongside other prominent figures such as billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and that he had asked the Justice Department to protect him.

"I think Pam Bondi should look into it," Mr. They said they can't really respond to most crime scenes."

White's social media accounts indicate that he himself believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list.

"I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at Infowars and with Alex Jones on the Ukraine proxy war The group who compiled this list is tied to the U.S. White allegedly confronted suspects attempting to break into his vehicle in the parking lot, upon which they shot him and fled the scene, stated Austin police Detective Jason Jones at a Wednesday press conference.

"Homicide Detectives and Crime Scene Specialists responded to process the scene and interview witnesses. The initial investigation shows that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of the apartment complex in which he lived. State Dept, USAID, [CIA](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cia)
 and George Soros," he wrote in June of 2024.

Alex Jones speculated that the killing "could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine. The Latin Times reports that White was found dead in Austin, Texas, with gunshot wounds, and Alex Jones claims that White was murdered by Ukrainian forces and was on a Ukrainian hit list (<image:785>, <image:786>, <image:787>, <image:788>, <image:789>, <image:790>). The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" discusses the murder of Jamie White, an InfoWars journalist, in Austin, Texas, and suggests that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list (<image:791>).

From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/): 
Content: "His sister and local police believe that his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities.**

[Pro-Russian sources](https://archive.ph/MWRtT)
 have spread manipulative headlines claiming that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was allegedly murdered shortly after Ukraine added him to its kill list. Ultra-right-wing and conspiracy-minded InfoWars journalist Jamie White was indeed murdered in Austin on the evening of March 9, on his way home from work. There is no evidence that Jamie White was on any “list of enemies of Ukraine” – and it is doubtful that such a list even exists.

! He was shot by a person or persons trying to break into his car for the second time_,” [she told The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)
. However, White frequently spread disinformation and anti-Ukrainian conspiracy theories, including claims about American bio-labs in Ukraine and that the Maidan protests were orchestrated by Barack Obama’s administration.

! Moreover, the screenshot White posted of the alleged “list” does not match the actual appearance of the Myrotvorets website. <image:13890>

Screenshot – X

Moreover, the journalist’s sister, Kelly Neal, does not believe White was deliberately targeted. Law enforcement officials [share that view](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html)
: police said White caught the perpetrators trying to steal his car, at which point he was shot. All available evidence contradicts Russian propaganda claims that this was a targeted assassination.

We have also previously debunked false claims that the Myrotvorets database included [UN Secretary-General António Guterres](https://www.stopfake.org/uk/fejk-generalnogo-sekretarya-oon-antoniu-guterresha-vnesli-do-bazi-mirotvorets/)
 and [Pope Francis](https://www.stopfake.org/uk/fejk-papu-rimskogo-frantsiska-vnesli-na-ukrayinskij-sajt-mirotvorets/)

 When the ten were interviewed, "none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds."[\[403\]](#cite_note-AbsolutelyCouldNot-407)

In an op-ed in _The Washington Post_, 17 former members of the [Watergate scandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal "Watergate scandal")

 wrote that "there exists compelling _prima facie_ evidence that President Trump has committed impeachable offenses," specifically serious and persistent [abuses of power](/wiki/Abuses_of_power "Abuses of power")

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)
, [Calvin Robinson](https://twitter.com/calvinrobinson/status/1592031504875544577)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)
, and shaking the industry as a whole.

To understand if and how its demise is connected to U.S. dollar, though that may be no longer [tenable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-slips-from-1-peg/)
).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)
 "A fundraising crypto foundation [@\_AidForUkraine](https://twitter.com/_AidForUkraine)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)
, [10,723 Ethereum](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14)
, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

Content: The search result from Wikipedia discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including allegations that Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. It mentions that the Obama administration was trying to provide diplomatic support to Ukraine, and Joe Biden's son joined the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. The article also mentions that Trump withheld aid to Ukraine and urged them to investigate the Bidens. The article also mentions the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.

Content: Newsweek published an article discussing the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The article mentions that the claim originated from social media posts and was spread by right-leaning commentators.

Multiple fact-checking sources, including Newsweek and the Associated Press, have investigated the claim and found no evidence to support it. The claim appears to have originated on social media and was promoted by right-leaning commentators and Russian influencers.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election."

## Actions
```
web_search("US aid to Ukraine laundered Democrat candidates")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, mentioning allegations of investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and Trump withholding aid to Ukraine ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)).

Newsweek and the Associated Press fact-checked the claim, stating that it originated from social media and was promoted by right-leaning commentators and Russian influencers. The Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that funds were laundered from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S. ([https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774), [https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380)). The AP's assessment is false. <image:2147>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Fact-checkers from Newsweek and the Associated Press have debunked the claim, stating that it originated on social media and lacks supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim that half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources, including Newsweek and the Associated Press, have investigated the claim and found no evidence to support it. The claim appears to have originated on social media and was promoted by right-leaning commentators and Russian influencers.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

Content: "Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democrat Kamala Harris.

Criswell said on ABC’s “This Week” that such baseless claims around the response to Helene, which caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains and a death toll that rose Sunday to at least 230, have created a sense of fear and mistrust from residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground.

“We’ve had the local officials helping to push back on this dangerous — truly dangerous narrative that is creating this fear of trying to reach out and help us or to register for help,” she said.

President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday that his administration “will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders — regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes.”

Meantime, FEMA is preparing for Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified into a Category 1 storm on Sunday as it heads toward Florida.

“We’re working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,” she said.

We're not going anywhere.

 [Farnoush Amiri, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/farnoush-amiri-associated-press) government’s top disaster relief official said Sunday that false claims and conspiracy theories about the federal response to Hurricane Helene — spread most prominently by Donald Trump — are “demoralizing” aid workers and creating fear in people who need recovery assistance.

“It’s frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. We have had the complete support of the state,” she said, referring to North Carolina.

Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.

Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on Israel, Ukraine and other foreign countries.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that President Biden made remarks regarding Hurricane Helene on September 30, 2024, not September 29, 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene and that his administration would continue working with local and state leaders. The evidence does not mention any announcement about withholding aid for the affected areas or providing additional aid to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence contradicts the claim by showing that Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene.

To fully verify the claim, information about Biden's statements on aid allocation for Hurricane Helene and Ukraine on September 29, 2024, would be needed.

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

*   Russia's online disinformation campaign extended well beyond 2016 and focused heavily on the NFL kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to stoke racial tensions, according to a new Senate report. 
*   It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
    , and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
    , but the new report builds on the extent to which this occurred. 
*   The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy continued as late as March 2018, and the trolls zeroed in on Colin Kaepernick at one point.
*   The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Netanyahu’s Visit to the White House Highlights Critical Foreign Policy Issues
==============================================================================

! President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the leaders discussed a range of issues, including Trump’s tariffs, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, and Türkiye-Israel relations, especially as tensions have escalated over each country’s role in a post-Assad Syria.
*   There have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as both countries battle for influence in Syria, although Trump suggested that he could serve as a mediator to help the two leaders move beyond their differences.
*   Hamas has been seriously degraded as a military force in Gaza but has not been destroyed, as Netanyahu promised in the opening weeks of Israel’s military campaign.
*   Trump also revealed during the White House meeting that the U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the leaders discussed a range of issues, including Trump’s tariffs, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, and Türkiye-Israel relations, especially as tensions have escalated over each country’s role in a post-Assad Syria.** It was Netanyahu’s [second visit](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-february-5/)
 to Washington D.C. Netanyahu is buoyed by his recent meeting with [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2022-april-7/)
, who welcomed Netanyahu and announced that Budapest would be withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has sought indictments for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for their role in Israel’s war in Gaza. <image:2171>

**Bottom Line Up Front**

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, although it is unclear whether key obstacles – such as Iranian support for its proxies or its ballistic missile program – will prove insurmountable.

**Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. Abroad, Israel has acted with free rein in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, emboldened both politically and militarily. However, there have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-erdogan-seeks-bigger-role-for-turkey-on-world-stage-but-at-what-cost/)
 as both countries battle for influence in Syria. On trade, tariffs levied against Israel remained at 17 percent, with no progress on that front during the meeting, even as Netanyahu promised to eliminate Israel’s trade deficit with the United States and dismantle existing trade barriers.

On Gaza, where Israel restarted its military offensive against Hamas three weeks ago, Netanyahu received no pressure or pushback from the Trump administration. While some would suggest that the Biden administration gave Netanyahu a blank check on dealing with Gaza, there were the occasional lectures on human rights and warnings about mounting civilian casualties."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. StopFake.org explicitly states that the claim is false, citing a Facebook post as the source of the misinformation. The article mentions that Netanyahu discussed resettlement options, but not to Ukraine and Syria.

The Soufan Center published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Netanyahu's White House visit and related discussions about Syria and the military campaign in Gaza. However, the evidence does not mention any resettlement plans.

The Jerusalem Post published an article on August 2, 2025, about a bilateral dinner between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025. This does not support the claim.

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/) states that the claim is false, citing a Facebook post with an image of Netanyahu and Trump as the source of the misinformation.

The Soufan Center published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Netanyahu's White House visit and related discussions about Syria and the military campaign in Gaza. <image:2171> The Jerusalem Post published an article on August 2, 2025, about a bilateral dinner between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025. <image:1>

**Vance**: That’s exactly what you’re doing …

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")

The scandal came to light when a [whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower")
 report revealed that President Trump had asked Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 in July 2019 to investigate [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
, Trump's political opponent in the [2020 presidential election](/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election")
, his son [Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden")
, and company [CrowdStrike](/wiki/CrowdStrike "CrowdStrike")
, to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 and Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
.[\[22\]](#cite_note-urged-22)
[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
 The allegations were confirmed by a non-verbatim summary of the conversation released by the White House.[\[10\]](#cite_note-Bump27-10)
[\[11\]](#cite_note-helderman-11)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-press_secretary-24)
 Trump acknowledged he had told Zelenskyy "we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son \[contributing\] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[\[25\]](#cite_note-trump_acknowledges-25)
 According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President [Mike Pence](/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence")
, and Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Balsamo-190926-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-auto2-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)

Immediately after the Trump–Zelenskyy call ended, White House national security aides discussed their deep concerns, with at least one [National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")
 (NSC) official alerting White House national security lawyers.[\[29\]](#cite_note-cnn-oct8-29)
[\[30\]](#cite_note-raised_alarms-30)
 A text message between a State Department envoy to Ukraine and a Ukrainian official showed the envoy understood from the White House that a Zelenskyy visit with Trump was contingent upon Ukraine's investigating [a conspiracy theory about alleged Ukrainian meddling](/wiki/Conspiracy_theories_related_to_the_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal "Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal")
 in the [2016 U.S. On May 7, Zelenskyy and a group of his advisors had a three-hour meeting to discuss how to respond to Trump and Giuliani's pressure and how to avoid becoming involved in domestic American politics.[\[90\]](#cite_note-pressure-90)
 Giuliani said the investigations he sought would be beneficial to President Trump, his client, and that his efforts had Trump's full support.[\[91\]](#cite_note-plans_trip-91)
 Giuliani's efforts began as an attempt to provide cover for Trump to pardon Manafort, who had been [convicted of eight felony counts](/wiki/Trials_of_Paul_Manafort "Trials of Paul Manafort")
 in August 2018.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

On May 10, Giuliani canceled a scheduled trip to Ukraine where he had intended to urge president-elect Zelenskyy to pursue inquiries into Hunter Biden, as well as whether Democrats colluded with Ukrainians to release information about Manafort.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)
[\[94\]](#cite_note-WaPo_How_Trump_pressured-94)
 Giuliani claimed he has sworn statements from five Ukrainians stating they were brought into the Obama White House in January 2016 and told to "go dig up dirt on Trump and Manafort", although he has not produced evidence for the claim.[\[95\]](#cite_note-CNBC-eight-times-95)
 Giuliani asserted he cancelled the trip because he had been "set up" by Ukrainians who objected to his efforts, and blamed Democrats for trying to "spin" the trip. On this call, Giuliani said that if Zelenskyy were to publicly announce an investigation into Biden, it would help Zelenskyy have "a much better relationship" with Trump.[\[98\]](#cite_note-new_audio-98)

Responding to a motion by the liberal watchdog group [American Oversight](/wiki/American_Oversight "American Oversight")
,[\[99\]](#cite_note-new_documents-99)
 on October 23 a federal judge gave the State Department 30 days to release Ukraine-related records, including communications between [Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State")
 [Mike Pompeo](/wiki/Mike_Pompeo "Mike Pompeo")
 and Rudy Giuliani.[\[100\]](#cite_note-100)
 On November 22, the State Department released internal emails and documents that bolstered Gordon Sondland's congressional testimony that Pompeo participated in Giuliani's activities relating to Ukraine. Ambassador to Ukraine, was removed from her post because of her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, and because she disagreed with the [shadow diplomacy](/wiki/State_within_a_state "State within a state")
 taking place under Giuliani and President Trump.

Days before Trump's July 25 call with Zelenskyy, Giuliani spoke on the phone with Zelenskyy aide [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")
 about a Biden investigation, as well as a prospective White House meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump that was sought by Ukrainian officials.[\[177\]](#cite_note-NYT_Long-Held_Trump_Grudge-177)
[\[98\]](#cite_note-new_audio-98)
 According to Zelenskyy's advisor [Serhiy Leshchenko](/wiki/Serhiy_Leshchenko "Serhiy Leshchenko")
, Trump was willing to have a phone conversation with Zelenskyy only on the precondition that they discuss the possibility of investigating the Biden family. Trump said three times that he would ask both Attorney General Barr and Giuliani to call Zelenskyy,[\[184\]](#cite_note-Timmons-185)
 and added: "So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great."[\[180\]](#cite_note-ShearHaberman-180)
 In response, Zelenskyy said his candidate for Ukraine's chief prosecutor "will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue". After Zelenskyy said this, Trump offered to meet with Zelenskyy at the White House.[\[181\]](#cite_note-releasedWaPo-181)
 On the same call with Zelenskyy, Trump espoused the [conspiracy theory](/wiki/List_of_conspiracy_theories#Trump,_Biden,_and_Ukraine "List of conspiracy theories")

Decision affects ammunition, vehicles and other equipment including weapons in transit

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)
 has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments, as the White House piles pressure on Kyiv to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin.

The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles and other equipment, including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president.

It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump, infuriated over what he claimed was the Ukrainian leader’s disrespect and ingratitude, told Volodymyr Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
” a third world war. Brendan Boyle​, a congressman in Pennsylvania who is a co-chair of the congressional EU caucus, ​said it was ​“reckless, indefensible and a direct threat to our national security”​.

Earlier on Monday, Trump had expressed fresh outrage at Zelenskyy for saying the end of the war could be “very, very far away”.

Trump posted a link to an [Associated Press story](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-starmer-trump-b025877c40ffe0ddf2a92adad1715231)
 outlining Zelenskyy’s comments and said: “This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!

“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US. What are they thinking?”

Later on Monday, Trump said Zelenskyy “won’t be around very long” unless he succumbed to pressure and made a deal on US terms.

The Trump administration was also reported to be [drawing up a plan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/trump-sanctions-russia)
 on Monday to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions on the Kremlin.

The White House has asked the state and treasury departments to draft a list of sanctions that could be eased for US officials to discuss with Russian representatives in the coming days as part of the [administration’s broad talks with Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/28/russia-appoint-us-ambassador-diplomatic-relations-thaw)
 on improving diplomatic and economic relations, Reuters reported, citing a US official and another person familiar with the matter.

In an interview recorded on Monday before the announcement of the suspension, Vance told the Fox News channel’s Hannity that giving the US an economic interest in the future of Ukraine would serve as a security guarantee – a reference to the minerals deal about which Zelenskyy had been summoned to Washington.

“If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,” Vance said.

----------- Zelenskyy was told to come back “when he is ready for peace”.

Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Tuesday that Kyiv still had the means to supply its frontline forces but warned thousands of lives were at risk and vital US-provided air defence systems could be affected.

“We will continue to work with the US through all available channels in a calm manner,” Shmyhal told a press conference. The Ramstein group is an alliance of 57 countries that has coordinated aid to Ukraine during the war.

 during a US administration that resents a cold war-era pact to support its allies against aggression, have rushed to boost their own military spending.

The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, [announced proposals on Tuesday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/eu-plan-to-bolster-europes-defences-could-raise-800bn-for-ukraine)
 to strengthen Europe’s defence industry and increase military capabilities by mobilising close to €800bn (£661bn). The EU is holding an emergency summit on Thursday.

The White House’s decision followed a meeting that included Hegseth and the vice-president, JD Vance, along with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; and Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said Trump appeared to be pushing Ukraine towards capitulation. It looks like he is pushing us towards capitulation, meaning \[accepting\] Russia’s demands.”

Razom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group, said: “By abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to continue marching west. In December, shortly before leaving office, Biden announced an additional $5.9bn in security and budget assistance.

US assistance to Ukraine includes military aid, budgetary assistance largely delivered through a World Bank trust fund, and other funds that had been delivered through the US Agency for International Development, which has been throttled by the Trump White House.

Some of the money sent by the US to Ukraine helps the country pay the salaries of teachers and doctors, and keeps the government running.

Weapons assistance from the US has been facilitated through two programmes: presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which allows the president to quickly transfer weapons and equipment from US stocks to foreign countries without the need for congressional approval; and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), under which military equipment is procured from the defence industry.

In total, the US has pledged $31.7bn of weapons aid to Ukraine through PDA. Razom for Ukraine urges the White House to immediately reverse course, resume military aid and pressure Putin to end his horrific invasion.”

The US Congress has approved $175bn (£138bn) in total assistance for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly three years ago, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump has not approved any new aid under his own presidential authority since taking office and a new congressional aid package appears unlikely, at least in the near term.

A White House official says the Trump administration Is pausing U.S. aid to Ukraine, just days after a disastrous meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

The White House says it will pause military aid to Ukraine as the country continues to defend itself from Russian attacks.

LEILA FADEL, HOST:

A White House official told NPR the administration wants to review the aid to see if it is contributing to peace. The decision comes after President Trump and Vice President Vance berated Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an Oval Office meeting last Friday.

MARTIN: Joining us now to talk about all this is NPR's Ukraine correspondent, Joanna Kakissis. And the Trump administration has not been pushing back on some of Moscow's demands, including Ukraine giving up territory and a path to NATO membership.

MARTIN: Do you have a sense of what kind of impact pulling this aid will have, recognizing, like you just said, that we're not exactly sure what it covers? for helping his country, and Ukrainians say they are fighting to preserve American-style liberty and democracy.

MARTIN: Do you have a sense of whether this was a surprise in Ukraine?

KAKISSIS: Well, there hasn't been much official reaction yet, though a member of Ukraine's parliament said lawmakers have been in meetings to find alternatives to U.S. Even before Friday's debacle in the Oval Office, President Trump was repeating Kremlin talking points, for example, claiming it was Ukraine, not Russia that started the war. A member of the Ukrainian parliament's defense committee said today that Ukraine might be able to hold on for about six months without U.S. This pause appears to affect at least a billion dollars in weapons and ammunition en route and on order for Ukraine."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:15> This image shows an authentic transcript of the heated White House meeting between US president Donald Trump, vice-president JD Vance and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025."

## Actions
```
web_search("Trump Zelenskyy meeting transcript")
web_search("Trump Zelenskyy aid Ukraine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include transcripts of a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. One transcript is available on Rev.com ([https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-and-zelenskyy-in-the-oval-office](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-and-zelenskyy-in-the-oval-office)).

The Guardian published an article with a transcript of the meeting between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and JD Vance ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript)). The transcript includes the exchange shown in <image:15> and <image:2209>. Another source provides a transcript of the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy meeting on February 28, 2025, in the Oval Office ([https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcript_of_the_2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_meeting](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcript_of_the_2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_meeting)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a White House meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including a phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy on July 25, 2019, and the withholding of military aid. The Guardian published an article on March 4, 2025, discussing the US suspension of military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting where Trump expressed frustration with Zelenskyy and threatened to cut off aid, also mentioning JD Vance. NPR also published an article on March 4, 2025, stating that the Trump administration paused U.S. aid to Ukraine after a "disastrous meeting" between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. <image:15>

The Guardian article can be found here: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/us-military-aid-ukraine-pause-trump-zelenskyy-updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/us-military-aid-ukraine-pause-trump-zelenskyy-updates).

The claim is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm the existence of a transcript of a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, including one that includes the exchange in <image:15>. The Guardian and NPR articles also discuss the context of the meeting, including the suspension of aid and the presence of JD Vance.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms the existence of a transcript of a meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vance, including the exchange shown in the image. The context of the meeting, including the suspension of aid, is also supported by multiple sources.

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

An online video claiming The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. government’s main overseas aid agency, paid some Hollywood stars to visit Ukraine has been debunked by the BBC.

The BBC Verify division [identified the fake video](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)
 as part of a Russian disinformation campaign, but only after the false content went viral on social media platforms and was [retweeted on X by Elon Musk.](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1887286413181296965/photo/1)

Stars mentioned in the video to have received payments included Angelina Jolie, Sean Pean, Jean Claude Van Dam, Orlando Bloom and Ben Stiller.

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

In a wide-ranging conversation on [Theo Von's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

Content: "Greene's trades have often drawn red flags due to her committee roles and the timing of the trades.

Musk's comments on Congressional wealth comes after former President **Joe Biden** supported a ban on Congress trading last year.

"Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they're in the Congress," Biden said in an interview.

Biden said he was able to live on a Congressional salary and not worry about becoming rich through playing the stock market previously.

Representative **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) [previously told Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/05/39096827/exclusive-khanna-says-shameful-congress-members-profited-from-stocks-calls-for-trading-ban-makin?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 that he will continue to advocate for a vote to ban the practice.

“We should have a vote on it,” Khanna told Benzinga.

Khanna said that despite his continued speeches in the House advocating for a ban on stock trading, there is a “collective shrug” in Congress regarding the issue.

"It is shameful that over three years after the pandemic with the shenanigans from those senators who sold their stock after learning of the pandemic" there still hasn't been a vote, Khanna said.

Khanna said that people were outraged at the time when several senators sold their stocks in tourism and other sectors that would be hurt, knowing that the economy could crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Senators making money when the rest of the country was suffering during the pandemic."

Unusual Whales helped [launch two Congress Trading themed ETFs](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/penny-stocks/23/02/30768851/want-to-copy-master-trader-nancy-pelosis-investments-theres-an-etf-for-that-here-are-the-hol?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 in 2023 through a collaboration with Subversive. Does anyone know?" Musk tweeted.

The quoted tweet included the following members of Congress:

*   **Nancy Pelosi** (D-Calif.): Annual salary $223,000, Net worth $202 million
    
*   **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.): Annual salary $200,000, Net worth $95 million
    
*   **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.): Annual salary $210,000, Net worth $75 million
    
*   **Elizabeth Warren** (D-Mass.): Annual salary: $285,000, Net worth $67 million
    

The replies included a post from the original poster with additional examples of politicians who have net worths of more than $50 million.

"I am not suggesting anything. While the former speaker of the house has been accused of providing insider information to her husband in the past, her husband makes investments as part of his career.

People in the comments were quick to point out inaccuracies in the net worth amounts with Warren estimated to be worth significantly less than this amount.

Story Continues

**Why It's Important:** Musk's post took aim at members of Congress regardless of their political party.

In comments made alongside **Donald Trump,** Musk said he questions how members of Congress are getting significantly wealthier while in office, while joking that maybe they're just good at investing.

"I think the reality is they're getting wealthier to taxpayer expense," Musk said.

An investigation into members of Congress and their investing activity and payments made by special interest groups while in office could reveal that members of both the Republican and Democratic parties made questionable moves to help boost their wealth.

This could be an interesting move by Musk, who is currently aligned with the Republican party and has the support of many Republican members of Congress.

The Unusual Whales congressional trading report for 2024 showed that Democrats averaged a 31.1% return in 2024 and Republicans averaged a 26.1% return versus the S&P 500 at 24.9%.

The top 10 traders in 2024 list was made up of six Republicans and four Democrats with five Congress members having returns of more than 100% in 2024.

Of the individuals listed in Musk's quoted tweet above, Pelosi ranked 10th in 2024 at +70.9%. Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk Questions Congress Members' Wealth: 'Where Did They Get All The Money?'
=================================================================================

[Chris Katje](/author/)

Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 8:00 PM 5 min read

Billionaire **Elon Musk** targeted members of Congress who enjoy rising wealth amounts while in office, which comes as retail traders place larger emphasis on politicians’ [stock and options trading activity.](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/congress-trading?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)

**What Happened:** Members of Congress can buy and sell stocks, options and cryptocurrency as long as they disclose the transactions in a timely manner.

This activity has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years as trades made by members of Congress often appear to be conflicts of interest based on non-public knowledge and can sometimes be stocks related to government-funded contracts.

     **Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.**
    

A post that discussed several prominent members of Congress with their annual salaries and net worths caught the attention of Musk, who is currently the world's richest person worth $379 billion.

"It's not like these politicians started companies or were NBA All-Stars, so where did they get all the money? Make your own conclusions," the poster tweeted.

The annual salaries in the post could include other sources of income and may not be strictly their Congressional salary.

The post also doesn't take into account how much the net worth of members of Congress was before they took office or what their spouses do.

Pelosi's husband **Paul Pelosi** is a venture capitalist who regularly buys and sells technology stocks. McConnell ranked 21st at +42.4%.

The claim: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has amassed more than $196 million in wealth working on a congressional salary of $193,400
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the richest members of Congress, but a social media post circulating about the wealth she has built while earning a congressional salary is wrong about her net worth.

The post claims Pelosi has been in office for 28 years, during which she earned $193,400 per year. <image:1238>

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. That’s about $90 million less than the figure cited in the meme.

Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987, when [members were paid $89,500.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1011.pdf)
 Today, as [speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500.](https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries)
 As minority leader, Pelosi would have earned the $193,400 spelled out in the meme.

But her salary from a 34-year career in Congress, including 18 years as minority leader and speaker, doesn’t tell the whole story about the personal wealth she and her husband have built.

 out on July 3, 2024 – both taken after last Thursday’s presidential debate – show that more voters are now supporting former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden. Biden, 81, [is the first octogenarian to occupy](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html)

It’s a bipartisan trend: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, is 72, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is 81. Bernie Sanders is 81 and hasn’t mentioned retirement at all.

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine

Hunter Biden (left) with his father, current US President Joe Biden

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday. <image:13935>!Getty Images Bill Barr <image:13941>Getty Images

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

 following the collapse of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)
 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)
> [\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."[\[35\]](#cite_note-Whitehurst_Mascaro_2/15/2024-35)

Conspirators
------------

The falsehoods about Hunter Biden were spread by possible Russian operatives in the Ukrainian parliament,[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)
 right-wing media supportive of Trump,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 and members of the Trump campaign, such as [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 and [Steve Bannon](/wiki/Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon")
.[\[43\]](#cite_note-43)

### Russian involvement

Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian [GRU](/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation) "GRU (Russian Federation)")
 lieutenant general [Vladimir Alekseyevin](/wiki/Vladimir_Alekseyev_(general) "Vladimir Alekseyev (general)")
, his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov.[\[44\]](#cite_note-44)
 They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers [Oleksandr Dubinsky](/wiki/Oleksandr_Dubinsky "Oleksandr Dubinsky")
 and [Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
, Prosecutor [Kostiantyn Kulyk](/wiki/Kostiantyn_Kulyk "Kostiantyn Kulyk")
 and businessmen [Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 and [Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The three were given ten million dollars[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)
 and used corrupt access to the Ukrainian Parliament and connections to media and politicians in the United States to spread the falsehoods.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
 Dubinsky, Derkach and Kulyk were sanctioned by the U.S. Dubinsky is accused of treason for allegedly working to help Russia in its war against Ukraine.[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)

Dubinsky held Press Conference with Andrii Derkach to spread the false rumors.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 He also met with [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 in 2019 for the production of a falsified film about the conspiracy.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

In May 2021 Dubinsky was sanctioned by the US Government, his assets frozen, and his [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube")
 channel shutdown. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 Later that year he had plans to meet Mr Giuliani to discuss the allegations in order to spread the false conspiracy.[\[58\]](#cite_note-facing_scrutiny-58)

Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

#### Dmytro Firtash

[Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 was a middleman for [Gazprom](/wiki/Gazprom "Gazprom")
 and connected to the Ukrainian government.[\[61\]](#cite_note-61)
 He has acknowledged that he was installed as a middleman by [Russian mob](/wiki/Russian_mob "Russian mob")
 boss [Semion Mogilevich](/wiki/Semion_Mogilevich "Semion Mogilevich")
.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
 to drop charges against Firtash but failed.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

#### Konstantin Kilimnik

[Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
 oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian [Federal Security Service](/wiki/Federal_Security_Service "Federal Security Service")
 (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections.[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by [President Putin](/wiki/President_Putin "President Putin")
,[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)
 He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump.[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

### American media involvement

American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 Specifically [Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
,[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)
 [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 [Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")
,[\[69\]](#cite_note-Vicens-2021-69)
 and [One America News Network](/wiki/One_America_News_Network "One America News Network")
[\[70\]](#cite_note-oan_atlantic-70)
 were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory.

#### Peter Schweizer

[Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
, editor-at-large at _[Breitbart News](/wiki/Breitbart_News "Breitbart News")
_ and president of the conservative [Government Accountability Institute](/wiki/Government_Accountability_Institute "Government Accountability Institute")
, was the first person to spread the falsehoods about Joe Biden and Burisma in his book "Secret Empires".[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The plagiarized book[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)
 included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets.[\[72\]](#cite_note-72)
 This, in turn, helped to lead Trump allies in Ukraine[\[73\]](#cite_note-73)
 and Congress to promote the lie.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)

#### John Solomon

_[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington_Post "Washington Post")
_ attributes [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
, formerly of _[The Hill](/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper) "The Hill (newspaper)")
_, the most responsibility[\[75\]](#cite_note-Farhi-2019-75)
 for the spread of the untrue claims in U.S. An internal review by the Hill found "serious doubts about the credibility of Solomon’s Ukrainian sources".[\[77\]](#cite_note-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-78)
 In testimony before Congress, [Alexander Vindman](/wiki/Alexander_Vindman "Alexander Vindman")
 said Solomon's claims were "entirely made up in full cloth".[\[79\]](#cite_note-79)

[Media Matters](/wiki/Media_Matters "Media Matters")
 reported in September 2023 that the previous month Solomon published a State Department briefing memo prepared for Joe Biden's December 2015 trip to Ukraine."

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

### News Release

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. "These strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders," Eastburn said.

Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation."

In the month since the US launched a major military campaign targeting the [Houthi rebel group in Yemen](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/middleeast/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthis-may-be-relishing-them-intl/index.html)
, the militants have successfully shot down at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones, hindering the US’ ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, multiple US officials familiar with the matter told CNN.

The US was hoping to achieve air superiority over Yemen within 30 days, officials said and degrade Houthi air defense systems enough to begin a new phase focusing on ramping up intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance of senior Houthi leaders in order to target and kill them, the officials said.

But the platforms best suited to conduct that persistent effort, the MQ9 Reaper drones, keep getting shot down, the officials explained. These assessments were largely based on signals intelligence, one of the people said.

Asked for comment about the downed drones and whether it has negatively impacted the operation, a defense official told CNN in a statement that “we are aware of the Houthi reports these MQ-9s have been shot down. The strikes have forced the Houthis to stay underground more and left them in a “confused and disarrayed state,” the officials noted.

But the consistent loss of the drones has made it more difficult for the US to determine precisely how much the US has degraded the Houthis’ weapons stockpiles.

Over the last six weeks, the Houthis have launched 77 one-way attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, 24 medium-range ballistic missiles, and 23 surface-to-air missiles either at US forces, into the Red Sea, or at Israel, two of the officials said.

The intelligence community has also assessed in recent days that over nearly six weeks of US bombing, the Houthis’ ability and intent to keep lobbing missiles at US and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and at Israel is little changed, as is their command-and-control structure, according to two other people familiar with the intelligence. Trump posted on X in March that the Houthis “have been decimated” and their capabilities “are rapidly being destroyed.”

While Eastburn provided additional data on Thursday regarding the impact of US strikes, US Central Command has been largely silent about the impact, however, even as it routinely shares photos and videos on its X account of missiles firing off of warships or US aircraft preparing to launch off aircraft carriers in the Red Sea. The US does not have boots on the ground in Yemen, so it relies on overhead surveillance — much of it from the MQ9s—to conduct battlefield damage assessments and track terrorists.

CNN [reported earlier this month](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 that the US had killed several Houthi officials considered to be mid-level, akin to “middle management,” rather than senior political leadership.

The officials said the US had hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15. “Additionally, Houthi ballistic missile launches have dropped by 87% while attacks from their one-way drones have decreased by 65% since the beginning of these operations.”

The administration is vowing to continue with the campaign until the Houthis can no longer attack Red Sea shipping. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson [last month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/text-of-a-letter-from-the-president-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-and-the-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate/)
, President Donald Trump said the operations would continue “until the Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.”

But the Houthis have long proven to be extremely resilient, burying their equipment deep underground and continuing to receive supplies from Iran. The Pentagon has also not addressed claims by the Houthis that the airstrikes have killed dozens of civilians.

In a rare update, CENTCOM said last week that it had destroyed a port in Yemen that the Houthis were using to import oil and fuel their attacks. But the impact of that on the Houthis’ operations similarly remains unclear.

One of the US officials who spoke to CNN left the door open for a continuous campaign in support of US partners in the Gulf region against the Houthis, similar to how the US operates in Africa.

The costs of the campaign, meanwhile, are only rising. The operation [cost the US nearly $1 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 in just the first three weeks, and the US has continued striking Houthi targets daily for over a month.

The large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who CNN has reported had complained in recent weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM that would be critical in the event of a war with China.

“We have to maintain a high state of indications and warning so we can get those forces back if there is a crisis with greater exigence than there is one in the CENTCOM (area of responsibility),” US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:20>)
web_search("US drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper on December 28, 2024, and another in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR and CNN reported on April 25, 2025, that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks, hindering the US's military operations. The U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission). <image:20>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down U.S. Reaper drones in 2025. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper in 2025. NPR and CNN reported that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks, hindering the US's military operations. The evidence also indicates that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence supports the claim that the Houthis shot down US drones in 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down in March 2025 or that Russian missiles were used.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in 2025, but the specific details about the image and the use of Russian missiles are not verified.

A drone crashed into a [New Jersey](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unidentified-objects-in-new-jersey-skies-trigger-ufo-conspiracy-theories-101734137956906.html)
 homeowner’s backyard after falling out of the sky on Thursday night, December 12. Following the incident, the town’s mayor drove to the scene to survey the site.

The drone crashed in a residential area of Pequannock Township in Morris County around 8:45 pm, as revealed by cops and dispatch audio. Officials said the craft was “a hobby or toy type of drone” and “not a large commercial or military grade drone,” the Pequannock Police Department told New York Post.

This incident comes shortly after New Jersey cops warned of possible “copycats.” “What we think is it started as some sort of Picatinny Arsenal base surveillance drill or operation but once it exploded online, this became a copycat situation,” one Garden State police chief said.

**‘God forbid something happens’**
----------------------------------

After the crash at the resident’s house, the mayor of Pequannock, Ryan Herd, pulled up in a Ford Econoline work van to take a look at the scene. God forbid something happens and it crashes into the big drone, and the big drone crashes into a house and kills six people — that’s going to be a problem,” he said.

The strange drone sightings have alarmed residents and lawmakers alike, with president-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/who-is-susie-wiles-trump-picks-universally-admired-republican-strategist-as-white-house-chief-of-staff-101731028933780.html)
 suggesting that government officials know more about them than they are disclosing. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP, File)(AP)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/14/550x309/Drone_1734152639153_1734152639365.jpg "This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP, File)(AP)")

This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. Herd said that “it is definitely not” one of the massive, car-size drones, but that he is “absolutely” concerned that “nobody knows whose drones are flying over us and what they’re flying over us for and where they’re taking off and landing.” “Drones are flying over our houses, which is our private property. My family is here,” he added.

The incident is now being investigated by the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office.

Herd has urged residents not to chase after, shoot at or attempt to catch the large drones. “We can’t be putting up Class 1 and Class 2 drones trying to follow these drones."

Drones have reportedly been spotted above Picatinny [Arsenal](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/arsenal)
, a military research and manufacturing facility in Rockaway, and President-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)
's golf course in Bedminster.

The brightly lit and low-flying drones have been described by eyewitnesses to be significantly larger than those flown by hobbyists, _The New York Times_ reported.

Joseph Orlando, the chief of the Florham Park Police Department in Morris County, said in a statement on Wednesday that drones had been spotted above critical infrastructure, such as water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, police departments and military installations.

"While we currently have no evidence or information to indicate these drones pose an imminent threat at this time, their presence appears nefarious in nature," he wrote.

In response, the Federal Aviation Administration has temporarily banned drones from flying over the military base in Morris County and Trump's golf club.

One family told [Fox News](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox-news)
 that while a drone hovered above them, [their car's clock changed time](https://www.newsweek.com/mysterious-new-jersey-drones-change-time-clocks-eyewitness-claims-1996630)

However, none of the evidence provides information about the location of the drone crash depicted in the image. Therefore, the location of the crash site in the image cannot be verified.

The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down in March 2025 or that Russian missiles were used.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:20>)
web_search("US drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper on December 28, 2024, and another in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR and CNN reported on April 25, 2025, that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks, hindering the US's military operations. The U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission). <image:20>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down U.S. Reaper drones in 2025. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper in 2025. NPR and CNN reported that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks, hindering the US's military operations. The evidence also indicates that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence supports the claim that the Houthis shot down US drones in 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down in March 2025 or that Russian missiles were used.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in 2025, but the specific details about the image and the use of Russian missiles are not verified.


## Actions
```
web_search("drone crash site location")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include information about drone crash sites. One source, from the Escape from Tarkov Wiki, discusses UAV crash sites in the game, with a map and images of the locations (<image:13615>, <image:13616>, <image:13617>). Another source, from Hindustan Times, reports on a drone crashing into a New Jersey homeowner's backyard in December 2024 (<image:1>). Newsweek also reports on mysterious drone sightings and a possible crash in New Jersey, with the FBI and local police investigating (<image:13618>).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about drone crash sites, including those in a video game and one in New Jersey. However, none of the evidence provides information about the location of the drone crash depicted in the image. Therefore, the location of the crash site in the image cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down in March 2025 or that Russian missiles were used. Furthermore, the location of the crash site in the image cannot be verified. Therefore, the claim is partially supported. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported. While evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down U.S. drones in 2025, the provided evidence does not verify that the image depicts a U.S. drone shot down in March 2025 or that Russian missiles were used. Additionally, the location of the crash site in the image remains unverified.

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What Happens Next
-----------------

Trump and Putin are slated to speak over the phone on Tuesday.

_This article contains reporting by The Associated Press._

_Correction 3/18/25, 8:43 a.m. ET: This article was updated to delete erroneous Associated Press reporting and clarify comments Tulsi Gabbard made about the relationship between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi._

_Update 3/17/25, 6:41 p.m. Her visit to India holds special significance: Gabbard, a veteran, was the first Hindu elected to [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress)
 when she served as a representative from Hawaii.

What To Know
------------

Gabbard criticized former President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
's handling of the war in Ukraine and said Trump's push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an "unwavering commitment to peace."

!Trump and Putin <image:1416>

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

Last week, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.'s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.

What People Are Saying

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires FADEL SENNA AFP

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Recapture town
--------------

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

"There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence,” he said.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told [Ukraine's military allies](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 in Brussels that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders - before Russia annexed Crimea - was unrealistic and that the U.S. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. Instead, one article mentions that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims under specific conditions ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)). Another article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)).

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention any offers of assistance.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress and mentions that Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee (<image:2574>). The document from torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with Adam Schiff listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. John Thune is listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Finance Committee. The document does not mention any blocking of committee assignments. The document from hklaw.com lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and John Thune is listed as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role in the impeachment trial against Donald Trump. <image:i>. The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to various committees in the Senate. However, the provided sources do not mention John Thune blocking any of Schiff's committee assignments. The AP article mentions Schiff's involvement in the Russia investigation and his role in the impeachment trial against Donald Trump.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The evidence does not provide information about John Thune's actions regarding Adam Schiff's committee assignments.


## Final Judgement
The search results do not provide any information about John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources discuss committee assignments but do not mention any such blocking. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The available evidence does not support the claim. While Adam Schiff was assigned to various committees, there is no mention of John Thune blocking any of his assignments. The provided sources, including those from [ACEC.org](https://www.acec.org/news/last-word-blog/post/senate-leaders-finalize-committee-assignments-for-the-119th-congress/), [torreydc.com](https://torreydc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate-Committee-Assignments_119-Congress_Printable.pdf), and [hklaw.com](https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/files/insights/eyes/2023/02/118thcongresscommitteeassignments.pdf), do not provide any information about Thune's actions regarding Schiff's committee assignments.

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Full form | Short form | Diminutive form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Cyrillic/Latin) |     |     |

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

\], _Real Lads_). Kolyan shows viewers the ridiculous side of the life of [gopniks](/wiki/Gopnik "Gopnik")
, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

*   patronymic;
*   sex;
*   date of birth;
*   place of birth.

**Russian passport expiration date**
------------------------------------

Russian passport expiry date:

*   from 14 years old – until reaching the age of 20;
*   from 20 years – until reaching the age of 45;
*   from 45 years – indefinitely.

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

To fill in the positions of the characters on the bottom line of a machine-readable record, a digital method of encoding information is used, except for the positions of characters 11 – 13 and 21.

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

Russian passport ID number

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that the claim is unfounded. While the Journal of Democracy discusses Putin's hostile policies towards the United States, it does not mention a declaration of war.

From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

The recent global inflationary experience was characterized by large sectoral demand shifts amid supply disruptions and unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. Outside of such cases, when supply bottlenecks are confined to specific sectors, conventional policy rules perform well.

###### Chapter 3: Understanding the Social Acceptability of Structural Reforms

Structural reforms are urgently needed as the world grapples with low growth, demographic shifts, and challenges related to the green and technological transitions. Expanding policymaking toolkits to incorporate citizens’ views can lead to greater social acceptance and successful implementation of reforms.

Content: "<image:13987>

Arthur Novosiltsev / Moskva News Agency

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia, with surging government spending on the war continuing to provide a powerful economic stimulus for the country.

The IMF also slashed its outlook for Ukraine, whose economy and infrastructure have been battered by two and a half years of conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine are spending huge sums to continue fighting in the war, with Moscow's state expenditures having helped the economy grow strongly despite a barrage of Western sanctions.

According to its latest forecast, the IMF said it expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 3.2%. But it also cut its prediction for next year's growth from 1.5% to 1.3% amid signs of mounting economic problems.

Russia's Central Bank has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the government's military spending, saying the economy has been “overheating” for months. High inflation — 8.6% in September — and intense labor shortages are also posing economic headaches for Moscow.

In a rare move, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged earlier this month that Russia's record low unemployment of 2.4% was a “limiting factor” for the country's growth prospects.

Russia's Central Bank has raised interest rates to 19% in a bid to bring inflation under control, and it could increase them again at a meeting this coming Friday.

Russia's Finance Ministry, meanwhile, proposed raising military spending next year by almost 30% to around $145 billion, with combined defense and security spending set to account for approximately 40% of state expenditures.

The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) forecast that Russia's economy will expand more quickly than the U.S. In January, the [World Bank](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/world-bank)
 predicted growth in Russia of 1.3 percent in 2024 and 0.9 percent in 2025.

"The IMF's announcement that Russia's economy will grow faster than previously predicted and that Western sanctions will not lead to the total collapse of the economy should not surprise us," Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Invest.Conotoxia.com, said.

"Russia's exports, despite some decline after the commodity boom, continue to hover around their multi-year average nominal value," he told _Newsweek_.

"The gradual weakening of the ruble seems to be having a positive effect on the economy that has regularly shown a positive balance of trade since the beginning of the century."

U.S.-led sanctions on Russia aimed to isolate it from the world economy included freezing $300 billion in central bank assets and trying to target its main exports of oil and gas.

In response, Moscow has tried to pivot away from the West, dividing the world into "friendly" and "non-friendly" countries, offering discounts for the former for its energy exports [which have benefited China and India.](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-gas-china-gazprom-replace-western-demand-fail-1865718)

"The sanctions have probably caused the most problems for Europe, not to Russia. Western countries have significantly lost access to a cheap energy source such as gas and oil," Drozdz added.

Boris Grozovski, an expert on the Russian economy from the Wilson Center think tank, said that the IMF assessment sounded reasonable but it did not mean that the sanctions had not worked.

"The Russian government has poured huge amounts of money into the military-industrial complex. However, long term growth potential was lower than it was before Putin's full-scale invasion."

The World Bank said last month that Russia's output had expanded by an estimated 2.6 percent in 2023 but this "stronger than expected recovery was fueled by substantial fiscal support, including additional military spending." Moscow plans to allocate almost a third of the increased budget spending in 2024 to defense to fund the war it started in Ukraine.

However, Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has warned of the dangers of an overheating economy and that the Russian government is fueling inflation by subsidizing more and more borrowing.

"If you try to drive faster than the car's design allows...then the engine will overheat sooner or later and we won't get far," she said in December.

_Newsweek_ has contacted Russia's finance ministry by email for comment.

Update 02/05/24, 9 a.m. economy will grow by only 2.1 percent this year, according to IMF figures. The Russian upgrade is the largest for any economy featured in an update to the fund's World Economic Outlook, released on Tuesday.

It paints a rosier picture of Russia's economy than the Russian Central Bank forecast in November that GDP would rise only between 0.5 and 1.5 percent."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.


## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024 declaration")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides the World Economic Outlook, October 2024, which includes projections and chapters on global prospects and policies, and also provides the World Economic Outlook Update, July 2025. The search result does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024 (<image:2695>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the search results do not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The IMF's World Economic Outlook, October 2024, is mentioned, but it does not confirm the specific declaration date.

Therefore, the claim's veracity remains uncertain due to the lack of explicit confirmation regarding the date of the IMF's declaration.


## Actions
```

Intelligence about the depot's munitions, its vulnerabilities, and nearby Russian defensive systems was provided to Ukraine by the [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
. The depot reportedly stored not only artillery shells, but also [Iskander](/wiki/Iskander "Iskander")
 missiles, [Tochka-U](/wiki/Tochka-U "Tochka-U")
 ballistic missiles and [glide bombs](/wiki/Glide_bomb "Glide bomb")
 and it is unclear if his [bomb damage assessment](/wiki/Bomb_damage_assessment "Bomb damage assessment")
 includes both missiles and artillery ammunition.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.

Ukraine's targeting of Russian military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia with drones and other weapons it already has — as well as making Russian civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine — is part of Kyiv's strategy.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia's Tver region about 240 miles northwest of Moscow and 300 miles from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine's Security Service, along with Ukraine's Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 4 miles wide.

_Kyiv, Ukraine_ — Ukrainian drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia overnight, causing a huge blaze and prompting the evacuation of some local residents, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. The strike came after a senior U.S. According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. Social Media/REUTERS

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a "massive drone attack" on Toropets, which has a population of around 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuation of some local residents.

There was no immediate information about whether the strikes had caused any casualties.

The depot housed missiles, glide bombs, and artillery shells. <image:14006> shows flames rising from an explosion. The article mentions that Ukraine has been pushing for approval from Western partners to use weapons to hit targets inside Russia.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, Russia, was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack, not a NATO strike. The attack resulted in explosions and fires. The depot stored various munitions, including missiles and artillery ammunition.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows a Russian ammunition depot hit by a NATO strike is false. Multiple sources confirm that the depot was attacked by Ukrainian drones. The evidence includes reports of explosions and fires at the depot, and the Ukrainian Security Service claimed responsibility for the attack.

`false`

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)
 soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, German tanks with German crews were captured, a NATO biolab was found under Mariupol, all with no evidence," Cusumano told _Newsweek_.

Even if proven true, he added that the "the scale and impact of US contractors' involvement is most likely minimal," and that the presence of "a private firm serving private objectives" would not constitute America's direct involvement in Kursk.

Keir Giles, senior research fellow at Chatham House's Russia & Eurasia Program, was less skeptical of the Foreign Ministry's claim, given that "large numbers of foreign volunteers are fighting alongside and supporting Ukrainian forces, Americans among them."

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence supports the claim that the image shows individuals with American flag patches on their uniforms. The image search confirms that such patches are used on military uniforms. The web search reveals that Russia accused American mercenaries of participating in the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. Therefore, the claim is plausible. However, the evidence does not confirm the identity of the individuals in the image.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
image_search("American flag patch military uniform")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast was launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions that the White House said that it was seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. (<image:24>)

Newsweek reports that Russia has accused American mercenaries of participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region in August 2024. (<image:4591>, <image:4588>, <image:4590>) The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed "strong protest" to the U.S. and claimed to have evidence of American PMC involvement. The U.S. has denied involvement. Anadolu Agency reports that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. (<image:1>) The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that US PMCs are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The article mentions an incursion into the Kursk region that began on the night of August 5-6.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of U.S. Army regulation flag patches and military uniforms with American flag patches. One source is from [starsnstripesco.com](https://starsnstripesco.com/products/copy-of-u-s-army-regulation-flag-patch-ocp?srsltid=AfmBOopc222egXRzsueUJYYrLIG9z4Cye0uR3e_ovnLIjk-SWrjTYPdb) <image:8818>.

Other sources are from [Propper.com](https://www.propper.com/usa-flag-reverse-patch.html?srsltid=AfmBOoodi2eBnTHkrQ-8Wre7x0lPv7ZlQETVFpxqk6fXFP9rsmwdAin8) <image:8819> and [asatechmed.com](https://www.asatechmed.com/products/6-pc-assorted-usa-tactical-american-flag-patch-100-embroidered-thin-blue-line-united-states-military-morale-patches-set-for-molle-hats-backpacks-tactical-vest-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOop5F0TNGVoiOShv4sY6Y4jSUPZvCpKRJRhlYDJQVx96wIeTvf_y) <image:8820>.


## Elaboration
The evidence supports the claim that the image shows individuals with American flag patches on their uniforms. The image search confirms that such patches are used on military uniforms. The web search reveals that Russia accused American mercenaries of participating in the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. Therefore, the claim is plausible. However, the evidence does not confirm the identity of the individuals in the image.

Расплата за Иловайск: оккупанты понесли огромные потери при бегстве из Балаклеи, видео

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)
.

  

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
image_search("American flag patch military uniform")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast was launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions that the White House said that it was seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. (<image:24>)

Newsweek reports that Russia has accused American mercenaries of participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region in August 2024. (<image:4591>, <image:4588>, <image:4590>) The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed "strong protest" to the U.S. and claimed to have evidence of American PMC involvement. The U.S. has denied involvement. Anadolu Agency reports that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. (<image:1>) The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that US PMCs are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The article mentions an incursion into the Kursk region that began on the night of August 5-6.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of U.S. Army regulation flag patches and military uniforms with American flag patches. One source is from [starsnstripesco.com](https://starsnstripesco.com/products/copy-of-u-s-army-regulation-flag-patch-ocp?srsltid=AfmBOopc222egXRzsueUJYYrLIG9z4Cye0uR3e_ovnLIjk-SWrjTYPdb) <image:8818>.

Other sources are from [Propper.com](https://www.propper.com/usa-flag-reverse-patch.html?srsltid=AfmBOoodi2eBnTHkrQ-8Wre7x0lPv7ZlQETVFpxqk6fXFP9rsmwdAin8) <image:8819> and [asatechmed.com](https://www.asatechmed.com/products/6-pc-assorted-usa-tactical-american-flag-patch-100-embroidered-thin-blue-line-united-states-military-morale-patches-set-for-molle-hats-backpacks-tactical-vest-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOop5F0TNGVoiOShv4sY6Y4jSUPZvCpKRJRhlYDJQVx96wIeTvf_y) <image:8820>.


## Elaboration
The evidence supports the claim that the image shows individuals with American flag patches on their uniforms. The image search confirms that such patches are used on military uniforms. The web search reveals that Russia accused American mercenaries of participating in the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. Therefore, the claim is plausible. However, the evidence does not confirm the identity of the individuals in the image.

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)
.

Украинский журналист **Денис Казанский** опубликовал красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ «селфятся» на фоне лежащего на земле оккупанта.

«Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!», - подписан кадр.

! <image:2753>

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне убегали так быстро, что бросали тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, отмечает журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист **Анатолий Цаплиенко** сообщает, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана.

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

![У центрі звільненої Балаклії вже встановлено прапор України](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20702'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. These differences matter because of the enormous presidential latitude with respect to nuclear decision-making, including presidents’ [sole authority](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf)
 to launch nuclear weapons without authorization from other parts of the government.

While in office, Trump was often confrontational in his dealings with other nuclear powers and was openly skeptical of the alliance relationships that depend on U.S. While valuing a robust deterrent, Biden also has a long-standing commitment to arms control.

What Trump did on nuclear policy while in office
------------------------------------------------

Trump’s [decision](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/)
 to renege on the Iran nuclear deal—despite the [State Department](https://2017-2021.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-18-2017/)
 certifying that Iran was complying with its terms—was likely the most significant nuclear policy decision of his time in office. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

Content: "plan approved by President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.

The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington's deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, the _Times_ said.

KCNA said North Korea's foreign ministry "expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S."

It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its sovereignty.

Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Pyongyang, which has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia as "absurd."

However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.

China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral party in Russia's offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.

But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war.

Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.

The country will "bolster up its strategic strength in every way to control and eliminate all sorts of security challenges that may result from Washington's revised plan," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "While serving as US President in 2024, Joe Biden ordered the US forces to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea."

## Actions
```
web_search("Joe Biden US President nuclear confrontation Russia China North Korea")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a The Guardian article published on August 20, 2024, Joe Biden approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea (<image:14011>). The White House stated the plan was approved earlier in the year and was not a response to a single country or threat. The Voice of America (VOA) reported on August 24, 2024, that North Korea condemned the new U.S. nuclear strategic plan, which was approved by President Joe Biden in March, to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea (<image:14018>).

The Brookings article discusses Biden's nuclear policy, mentioning that Biden deterred Russian nuclear escalation in the war in Ukraine and worked to stabilize relations with China and Russia.

The Guardian article from August 20, 2024, and the VOA report from August 24, 2024, both support this. The White House stated the plan was approved earlier in the year.

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)

 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that his forces had advanced up to 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of two more settlements there.

Russia said it had struck Ukraine's 22nd and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, and a Guard and Support Brigade in at least 12 different places with air strikes, artillery and infantry.

Moscow said it had also repelled attacks at seven additional places in Kursk and had struck Ukrainian forces at 16 other locations in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region.

"Units of the northern group of forces, with the support of army aviation and artillery fire, repelled attacks by enemy assault groups in the direction of the settlements of Kremyanoye, Malaya Loknya and Nechayev," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

It said Russian forces had also "thwarted attempts to attack in the direction of Komarovka, Spalnoye, Korenevo, Pogrebky and Olgovka."

The ministry said it was seeking to identify and destroy Ukrainian sabotage units which had hidden in the forests in an attempt to penetrate deeper into Russian sovereign territory.

While the Kursk incursion has grabbed headlines, Russian officials say the attack will fail to draw Russian forces away from the east of Ukraine where they are still advancing. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports from either side.

Russia also gave estimates for Ukrainian losses in Kursk, but Reuters does not publish combatant estimates from either side.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."
