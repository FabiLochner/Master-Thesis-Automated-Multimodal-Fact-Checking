### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the image of the Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain" is fake. Gwara Media ([Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/)) and The Journal.ie ([Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/)) both debunk the image, with the latter stating that the Hull Daily Mail's parent company confirmed the headline was fake. The fake cover was spread on Telegram channels and other pro-Russian sources. ![image 1451](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573946-256635.jpg), ![image 1452](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573949-807201.jpg), ![image 1454](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573951-547510.jpg), ![image 1470](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574071-817295.jpg), ![image 1471](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574072-732356.jpg), ![image 1472](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574075-181803.jpg)
