## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss a Fox News broadcast error during an Easter service on April 20, 2025, where Kyiv was incorrectly labeled as a Russian city. The mistake occurred on LiveNOW from Fox, a news service delivered by Fox Television Stations, during a broadcast showing midnight masses in Moscow, Kyiv, and the Vatican. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry requested an apology and investigation. The broadcast also showed footage of Vladimir Putin attending an Easter service in Moscow, conducted by Patriarch Kirill.

The error, which initially displayed "Kyiv, Ukraine," was changed to "Kyiv, Russia" for about 20 minutes before being corrected. The sources include articles from Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-fox-livestream-news-233600386.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-fox-livestream-news-233600386.html)), Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukraine-seeks-apology-from-fox-news-for-labeling-kyiv-russian-city-/3543703](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukraine-seeks-apology-from-fox-news-for-labeling-kyiv-russian-city-/3543703)), and Newsweek ([https://www.newsweek.com/fox-channel-ukraine-kyiv-russia-labeling-orthodox-easter-2061891](https://www.newsweek.com/fox-channel-ukraine-kyiv-russia-labeling-orthodox-easter-2061891)). ![image 13](media/33.jpg) ![image 2014](media/2025-08-07_19-32-1754595142-133365.jpg)


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in question (![image 13](media/33.jpg)) was found in multiple sources. These sources report on a Fox News broadcast from Easter 2025 that mistakenly labeled Kyiv as a Russian city during a live broadcast of the Easter service. The broadcast featured the Russian Orthodox Church ceremony with Vladimir Putin and Patriarch Kirill. The error was later corrected.

The articles are from "Susp—ñlne" ([https://suspilne.media/999087-fox-news-poznaciv-kiiv-ak-rosijske-misto-pid-cas-translacii-velikodnogo-bogosluzinna-pcu/](https://suspilne.media/999087-fox-news-poznaciv-kiiv-ak-rosijske-misto-pid-cas-translacii-velikodnogo-bogosluzinna-pcu/)), 444.hu ([https://444.hu/2025/04/20/oroszorszaghoz-csatolta-kijevet-a-fox-news](https://444.hu/2025/04/20/oroszorszaghoz-csatolta-kijevet-a-fox-news)), and Rijeka Danas ([https://www.rijekadanas.com/fox-news-nazvao-kijev-ruskim-gradom/](https://www.rijekadanas.com/fox-news-nazvao-kijev-ruskim-gradom/)).


## Elaboration
The claim is accurate. The evidence confirms that the image is from a Fox News broadcast during an Easter service in 2025. The broadcast incorrectly labeled Kyiv as a Russian city. The image shows Patriarch Kirill and the broadcast's lower third indicates that Putin attended the Easter service.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the image is from a Fox News broadcast during an Easter service in 2025, where Kyiv was incorrectly labeled as a Russian city. The broadcast featured Patriarch Kirill and Putin.
