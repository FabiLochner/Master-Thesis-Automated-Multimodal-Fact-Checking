Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/06/fake-charlie-hebdo-cover-shows-zelenskyy-exploiting-popes-death-for-cash): 
Content: Euronews published an article on May 6, 2025, discussing a fake Charlie Hebdo cover that mocks Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis. The article states that pro-Russian actors are spreading fake Charlie Hebdo editions online to discredit Ukraine and weaken Western support for Kyiv. The fake cover, which was supposedly published on April 23, 2025, depicts Zelenskyy holding the body of the late Pope Francis. The article provides evidence that the cover is fake by comparing it to the real Charlie Hebdo publications. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo has previously warned about pro-Russian actors using its image to produce anti-Ukraine content.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin is fabricated. Fact-checks from mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) and aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)) confirm the image's inauthenticity, and a Charlie Hebdo journalist verified it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
