Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing misinformation about the government's response to Hurricane Helene. The article mentions that Donald Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants. The article also mentions that the North Carolina National Guard had completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets. <image:13049>, <image:13053>, <image:13055>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118): 
Content: France 24 published an article on October 1, 2024, reporting on President Biden's response to Hurricane Helene. <image:k> The article mentions that Biden visited North Carolina to assess rescue efforts and that the death toll reached 130. Biden refuted claims that the government was slow to respond. The article also mentions that Trump criticized Biden's response.

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including reports from the BBC, Le Monde, and France 24, indicates that President Biden responded to Hurricane Helene by visiting affected areas and pledging aid. However, none of the sources support the claim that Biden announced a cessation of aid for hurricane relief or the allocation of funds to Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
