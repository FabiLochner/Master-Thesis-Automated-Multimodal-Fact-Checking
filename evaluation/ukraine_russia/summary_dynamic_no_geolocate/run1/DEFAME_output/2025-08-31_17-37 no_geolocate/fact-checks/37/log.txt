The claim 'In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.' is false.
Justification: Based on reports from the Times of India and Yahoo News, President Biden boarded the plane after the arrival of freed Americans in August 2024, but not after they exited the aircraft. The Times of India states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew, while Yahoo News indicates he spoke to those who helped bring the prisoners home. Therefore, the claim that Biden boarded an empty plane is inaccurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
