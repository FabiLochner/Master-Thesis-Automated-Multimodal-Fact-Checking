Useful result: From [Source](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf): 
Content: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict. The report mentions the involvement of 58 National Societies, including the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society is at the forefront of the response in Ukraine. <image:k>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the image appears in a CNN article related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the context of the image does not confirm that it depicts Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the front, as stated in the claim. The evidence includes a [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam) that features the image, but it does not confirm the claim's specific context.

So, the overall veracity is: false
