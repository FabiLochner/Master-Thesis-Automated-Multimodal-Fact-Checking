Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/drone-accident): 
Content: The search result from Getty Images contains several images of drone accidents. One image shows a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 drone that crashed on April 25, 2024, and was provided by the Houthi Media Center. <image:13230> shows a railway accident. Other images show crashed drones, including a Russian drone and an Israeli drone.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the Houthis did shoot down US drones in March 2025, the provided image could not be verified as depicting such an event. Reverse image searches and additional web searches did not provide any matching results or context for the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
