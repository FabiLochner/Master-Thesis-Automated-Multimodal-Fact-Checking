## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows a Russian Air Force MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993. The photo was taken on July 24, 1993, in Fairford, United Kingdom. The pilot can be seen ejecting.

The image is available on websites such as [Airteam Images](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672) and [Peakpx](https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-oyvnm). The image is also featured in an article published by AFP India, translated by SHIM Kyu-Seok, which can be found [here](https://factcheckkorea.afp.com/doc.afp.com.324U6AA). ![image 5](media/6.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum, not a US F-16 fighter jet. The incident occurred in 1993 during a British air show, not in August 2024 over the Black Sea. The pilot is ejecting, indicating a mid-air collision.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, not a US F-16 shot down in 2024. The claim misrepresents the aircraft, the location, and the date of the event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, as confirmed by reverse image searches and sources like [Airteam Images](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672) and [Peakpx](https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-oyvnm). The claim incorrectly identifies the aircraft as a US F-16 and misrepresents the event's location and date.
