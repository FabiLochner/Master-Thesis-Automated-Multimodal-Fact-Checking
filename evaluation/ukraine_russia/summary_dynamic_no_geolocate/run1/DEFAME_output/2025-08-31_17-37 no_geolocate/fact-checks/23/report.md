## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. In late 2024, the United States provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan. President Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, and then lifted the freeze shortly after ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)).

NPR published an article on August 5, 2025, discussing military aid to Ukraine, stating that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ![image 494](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502171-020535.jpg), ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg) ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg). The article mentions the administration's announcement of weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a BBC article published on November 15, 2024, the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, according to the Kiel Institute. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The article also mentions that Donald Trump claimed the US had spent over $300 billion, which the BBC Verify concluded was not accurate. ![image 3178](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853512-728986.jpg), ![image 3180](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853514-364342.jpg)

Another source states that the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022, with security assistance totaling $130.7 billion. The source was updated on March 14, 2025.

## Elaboration
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine by February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. The BBC article states that the US had spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion had been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. Another source indicates that security assistance totaled $130.7 billion as of March 14, 2025. Furthermore, Donald Trump's claim of over $300 billion spent was deemed inaccurate by BBC Verify.

The evidence suggests that the actual amount of aid provided by the US is significantly less than the $350 billion stated in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources provide figures for military aid to Ukraine that are significantly lower than $350 billion as of February 2025. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crew8y7pwd5o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crew8y7pwd5o)), indicate that the total amount of US aid to Ukraine by February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The BBC reported $130.6 billion spent by June 30, 2025, and the US Department of Defense reported $184.8 billion appropriated by March 31, 2025.
