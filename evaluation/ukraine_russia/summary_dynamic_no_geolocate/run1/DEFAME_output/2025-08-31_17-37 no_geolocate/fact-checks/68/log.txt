Useful result: From [Source](https://scdailygazette.com/2025/01/03/repub/in-first-speech-as-u-s-senate-majority-leader-thune-pledges-to-protect-filibuster/): 
Content: The article from scdailygazette.com, published on January 3, 2025, reports on John Thune's first speech as U.S. Senate Majority Leader. <image:i> Thune pledged to protect the filibuster. The article mentions Adam Schiff and Andy Kim took their oaths in December. The article does not mention Thune blocking Schiff's committee assignments.

The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Adam Schiff was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy, there is no evidence that John Thune blocked Schiff's committee assignments. The search results show Schiff's committee assignments and Thune's role as Senate Majority Leader, but no indication of Thune taking action to block Schiff's assignments.

So, the overall veracity is: false
