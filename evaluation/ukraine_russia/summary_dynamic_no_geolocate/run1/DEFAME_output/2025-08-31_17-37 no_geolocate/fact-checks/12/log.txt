Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/g-s1-51506/european-leaders-react-to-zelenskyy-oval-office): 
Content: The NPR article, published on March 1, 2025, discusses European leaders' support for Ukraine following a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump. The article mentions a summit of European leaders in London on Sunday. The article also mentions that the Ukrainian President arrived in London on Saturday to meet with the British prime minister. <image:12932> shows the British Prime Minister welcoming Zelenskyy to 10 Downing Street on March 1, 2025.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. The image is authentic and depicts leaders at the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, which took place on March 2, 2025, as confirmed by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-peace-talks-ukraine-key-takeaways-london-summit), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-starmer-summit-intl). However, the evidence does not support the assertion that the leaders removed their suits to show support for Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
