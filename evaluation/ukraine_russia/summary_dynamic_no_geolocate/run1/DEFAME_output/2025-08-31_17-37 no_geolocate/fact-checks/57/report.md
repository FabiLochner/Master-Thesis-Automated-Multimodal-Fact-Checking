One source indicates that an AI-generated audio was overlaid onto a video of the interview. Other sources state that the original interview did not mention Keir Starmer or the deal.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that the interview did not contain the statements described in the claim. The evidence includes fact-checks and articles that debunk the claim.
