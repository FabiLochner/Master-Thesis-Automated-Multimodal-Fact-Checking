## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The AOL article ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)) fact-checks the claim that Elon Musk posted "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and states that the claim is false, with no evidence of the post. The image of the tweet is fake, and a search of Musk's X account did not yield any results.
