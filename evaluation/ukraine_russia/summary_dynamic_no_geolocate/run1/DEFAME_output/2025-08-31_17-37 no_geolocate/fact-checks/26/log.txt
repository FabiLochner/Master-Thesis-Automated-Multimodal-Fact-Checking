Content: NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House. The visit ended abruptly after a spat in the Oval Office between Zelenskyy and Donald Trump. <image:517> The article mentions that Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on February 28, 2025, about a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The meeting was described as a "shouting match" where Trump told Zelenskyy to be "thankful" for US support. Trump also released a statement on social media seemingly withdrawing the US from negotiations with Ukraine. The article does not contain the quote in the claim.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: While a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House in February 2025 is confirmed by multiple sources, including a Wikipedia article and reports from NPR and Al Jazeera, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim is not found in any of the provided evidence. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.

So, the overall veracity is: false
