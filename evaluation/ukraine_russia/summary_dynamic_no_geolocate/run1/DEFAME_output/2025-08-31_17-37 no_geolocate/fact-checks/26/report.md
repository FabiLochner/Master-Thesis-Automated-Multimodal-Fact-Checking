## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy met at the White House on February 28, 2025. The meeting was contentious, and the Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025 (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). NPR reported that Zelenskyy's visit ended abruptly after a spat in the Oval Office, where they were finalizing a deal on minerals. Trump said Zelenskyy overplayed his hand, and the visit was cut short, including lunch and a joint press conference (![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg)).

Al Jazeera reported on the meeting, describing it as a "shouting match" where Trump told Zelenskyy to be "thankful" for US support. Trump also released a statement on social media seemingly withdrawing the US from negotiations with Ukraine. The article does not contain the quote in the claim (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump met at the White House in February 2025, and the meeting was contentious. However, the provided sources do not contain the quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim.

The Al Jazeera article describes a "shouting match" but does not include the specific quote. The NPR report mentions a spat in the Oval Office but does not provide details of the exchange.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House in February 2025, which was reportedly contentious. However, none of the provided sources contain the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim.

Since the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House in February 2025 is confirmed by multiple sources, including a Wikipedia article and reports from NPR and Al Jazeera, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim is not found in any of the provided evidence. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.
