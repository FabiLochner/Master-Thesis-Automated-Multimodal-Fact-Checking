None of the sources mention that White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones speculated that the killing “could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine, while the police believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle. White's social media accounts indicate that he believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" also discusses the murder and mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list.

The evidence also indicates that Alex Jones speculated that the killing "could've been a hit" orchestrated by Ukraine, and that White believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that it was revealed that White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Jamie White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, and that there are speculations about a Ukrainian connection. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that it was revealed that White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.
