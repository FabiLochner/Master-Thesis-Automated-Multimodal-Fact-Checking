The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin did occur on February 12, 2025, as reported by the Kremlin ([http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)), and negotiations were planned, there is no evidence to support the assertion that an agreement to end the war in Ukraine was reached on that date.

So, the overall veracity is: false
