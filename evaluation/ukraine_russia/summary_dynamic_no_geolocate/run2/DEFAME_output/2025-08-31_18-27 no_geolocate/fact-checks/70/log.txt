Useful result: From [Source](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/): 
Content: The Journal of Democracy published an article in April 2022 by Robert Person and Michael McFaul, discussing Putin's policies towards the United States. The article mentions that Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies towards the United States and invoked the NATO threat as justification. The article also includes an image of a demonstration with flags from different countries, including the United States, in support of Ukraine. <image:2694>
