Content: The article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The Russian military claimed to have destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks between May 11 and 17, 2024. The article also mentions the destruction of other military equipment, including armored vehicles and helicopters. The article includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank <image:2776> and another image of destroyed tanks <image:26>.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts destroyed tanks, likely Leopard tanks, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine, as evidenced by articles from sources like [Sputnik Africa](https://sputniknews.africa/20241017/ukraine-has-lost-around-40-leopard-tanks-since-february-2022-1069979787.html), [The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/06/13/russia-says-it-captured-german-leopard-tanks-in-ukraine-a81307), and [Defence Security Asia](https://www.defencesecurityasia.com/en/ukraine-war-german-leopard-tanks-destroyed/). However, the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence, as the provided sources do not mention this specific event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
