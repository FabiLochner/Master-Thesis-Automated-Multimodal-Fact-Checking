Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/politics/trump-timeline-russia-ukraine-putin-zelensky-dg):

Useful result: From [Source](https://libguides.cairn.edu/ukraine/timeline): 
Content: The search result is a timeline of events in Ukraine's history, from the 9th century to January 2023. It includes key dates and events related to Ukraine's relationship with Russia, such as the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the ongoing conflict in Donbas, and the 2022 full-scale invasion. The timeline does not mention any peace deal reached in early 2025.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While discussions about a peace deal were ongoing in August 2025, as reported by sources like the [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/trump-timeline-russia-ukraine-putin-zelensky-dg), no peace deal had been reached by that time.

So, the overall veracity is: false
