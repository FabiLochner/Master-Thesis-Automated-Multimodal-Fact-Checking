## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Yahoo News article from October 3, 2024, discusses a claim that Biden said no more aid would be provided for Hurricane Helene victims. ![image 13529](media/2025-08-31_18-53-1756666421-269756.jpg) The article states that Biden announced a new $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine on September 29, 2024, and that he would be asking Congress for a supplemental aid bill for those affected by the storm. The France 24 article from October 1, 2024, reports on President Biden's response to Hurricane Helene, including his visit to North Carolina to assess rescue efforts. <image:k>

The PBS News article from October 2, 2024, reports that President Biden toured the storm damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the Carolinas and ordered 1,000 active-duty troops to the region to help with aid efforts.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. On September 29, 2024, Biden announced an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine, not $2.4 billion. Furthermore, he stated he would request supplemental aid for Hurricane Helene victims, not that no more aid would be provided.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that the claim is false. Biden did not announce that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene. Instead, he announced a new military aid package for Ukraine and would request supplemental aid for the hurricane victims.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. On September 29, 2024, President Biden announced an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine, not $2.4 billion, and stated he would request supplemental aid for Hurricane Helene victims, contradicting the claim that no more aid would be provided, as reported by [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-153402427.html).
