## Elaboration

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that there is no evidence that Mark Rutte said he would expel the U.S. from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin; the claim originated from a post on Telegram and was shared on X (formerly Twitter) ![image 13386](media/2025-08-31_18-39-1756665562-433039.jpg). The NATO website contains remarks by Mark Rutte at a meeting with Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, D.C. on August 18, 2025, where Rutte discussed stopping the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure. Yahoo News reports that a NATO spokesperson called the claim "baseless" and that Rutte congratulated Trump after the election ![image 13392](media/2025-08-31_18-39-1756665571-006037.jpg).

The sources are: [https://www.newsweek.com/did-nato-chief-vow-kick-us-out-over-trumps-ukraine-plan-what-we-know-mark-rutte-1983779](https://www.newsweek.com/did-nato-chief-vow-kick-us-out-over-trumps-ukraine-plan-what-we-know-mark-rutte-1983779), [https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_237212.htm](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_237212.htm), and [https://www.yahoo.com/news/nato-secretary-general-congratulated-trump-002143816.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/nato-secretary-general-congratulated-trump-002143816.html).


## Elaboration
The new evidence directly contradicts the claim. Newsweek reports that there is no evidence of Rutte making the statement, and a NATO spokesperson called the claim "baseless." The claim originated from a Telegram post and was shared on X.


## Final Judgement
The initial search did not find any evidence to support the claim. Subsequent searches revealed that the claim is false. Newsweek and Yahoo News both report that the claim is baseless and originated from a social media post.
