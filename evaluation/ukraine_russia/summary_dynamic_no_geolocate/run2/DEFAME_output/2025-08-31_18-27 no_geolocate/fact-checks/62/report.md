### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

NPR and CNN report that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025. The U.S. has hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate in 2025. NPR and CNN report that the U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. However, the evidence does support the claim that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025.

The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. The claim that the Houthis used Russian missiles is supported by the Atlantic Council, which reports that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Escape from Tarkov Wiki discusses a quest involving crashed UAV drones on Shoreline, with images of the crash sites (![image 13615](media/2025-08-31_19-13-1756667599-090047.jpg), ![image 13616](media/2025-08-31_19-13-1756667599-521311.jpg), ![image 13617](media/2025-08-31_19-13-1756667600-111665.jpg)). The Hindustan Times reported on a drone crashing into a New Jersey backyard in December 2024. Newsweek reported on mysterious drone sightings and an alleged crash in New Jersey, with the FBI and local police investigating (![image 13618](media/2025-08-31_19-14-1756667666-063188.jpg)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results provide images of drone crash sites. Dronewars.net shows a crashed drone ![image 13624](media/2025-08-31_19-14-1756667680-603742.jpg). NBC News shows a drone assessing the Metrojet crash site in Egypt ![image 13625](media/2025-08-31_19-14-1756667682-583735.jpg). The Mayor shows a drone crash site in Zagreb, Croatia ![image 13626](media/2025-08-31_19-14-1756667685-293318.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides images of drone crash sites, but none of them match the image in the claim. The evidence does not provide any information about the location of the crash site in the image. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reports that two Lebanese soldiers were killed while investigating an Israeli drone crash in southern Lebanon on August 28, 2025. The Times of Israel reports that an Israeli Air Force Hermes 900 drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran on June 18, 2025, and includes an image of the crashed drone. The Jerusalem Post reports that an Iranian Shahed 136 drone crashed into a building in Beit She'an, Israel, on June 21, 2025, and includes an image of the crash site. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 13627](media/2025-08-31_19-15-1756667703-111174.jpg), ![image 21](media/69.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera's search result includes an image of a crashed drone ![image 13628](media/2025-08-31_19-15-1756667720-086026.jpg). Defense News shows an image of an Israeli F-16I destroyed in an attack ![image 13629](media/2025-08-31_19-15-1756667732-164815.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides images of drone crash sites, including one from the Times of Israel of an Israeli Air Force Hermes 900 drone shot down over Iran on June 18, 2025, and another of an Iranian Shahed 136 drone that crashed in Beit She'an, Israel, on June 21, 2025. However, none of the images match the image in the claim. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim does not match any of the drone crash sites found in the search results. The claim also states that the drone was shot down by the Houthis, but the evidence does not confirm this. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim does not match any of the drone crash sites found in the search results. While there is evidence of US drones being shot down by the Houthis, the specific image and its context cannot be verified. Therefore, the claim is false.
