## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`

CNN and France 24 reported on the situation in the Kursk region, with CNN mentioning that President Zelensky denied that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces, and France 24 stating that Zelensky denied that his troops were encircled in the Kursk region and that Russia has retaken villages in the region, including Sudzha.
