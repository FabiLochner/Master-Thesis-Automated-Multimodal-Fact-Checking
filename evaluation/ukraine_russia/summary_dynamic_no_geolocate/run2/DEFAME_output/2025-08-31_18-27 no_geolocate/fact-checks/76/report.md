The Guardian reports that Joe Biden approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea (![image 13749](media/2025-08-31_19-32-1756668720-230140.jpg)). The White House stated that the plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat. The Voice of America (VOA) published an article on August 24, 2024, reporting that North Korea condemned a new U.S. nuclear strategic plan, approved by President Joe Biden in March, to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea (![image 13758](media/2025-08-31_19-32-1756668749-988266.jpg)).

The Brookings article discusses Biden's nuclear policy while in office, mentioning that Biden successfully deterred Russian nuclear escalation in the war in Ukraine and has worked to stabilize relations with China. The article also mentions that Biden has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia.
