## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from [Gwara Media](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/) debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The article was not found on the Fox News website, and the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center. The article also mentions that the Telegram channel "Медведь" spread the disinformation. The [DW article](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) fact-checks a claim that a Fox News article reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center, stating that a manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article has been circulating on social media. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine)) states that the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center is a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces concerned with psychological and informational warfare. ![image 11](media/14.jpg) ![image 1806](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593661-766175.jpg) ![image 1805](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593661-510813.jpg) ![image 1804](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593659-558604.jpg) <image:x>
