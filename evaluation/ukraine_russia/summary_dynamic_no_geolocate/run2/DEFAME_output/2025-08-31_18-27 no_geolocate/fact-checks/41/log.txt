The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine is not supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including timelines from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) and [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-ukraine-war-timeline), indicate that the war began with Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022. While Zelenskyy was in office and responded to the invasion, the evidence does not suggest he initiated the conflict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
