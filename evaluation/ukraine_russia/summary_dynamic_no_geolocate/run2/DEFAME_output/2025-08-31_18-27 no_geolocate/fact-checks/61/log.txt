	2. August 24, 2023 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66609678
Useful result: From [Source](http://www.en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news): 
Content: The official website of the President of Russia, kremlin.ru, lists news and events. The website shows that Vladimir Putin was active in late August 2025, with meetings and greetings. The website also includes news from August 31, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66609678): 
Content: The BBC reports that Vladimir Putin commented on the reported death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, in a plane crash. Putin expressed condolences to the families of those on board but did not explicitly confirm Prigozhin's death. The article mentions that a US official stated the most likely cause of the crash appeared to be an explosion aboard the aircraft. The article was published on August 24, 2023.

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Vladimir Putin died in an explosion is demonstrably false. While there have been reports of incidents involving Putin's limousines and speculation about his health, there is no evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, official sources, such as the [Kremlin website](https://kremlin.ru/), show Putin was active in late August 2023, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
