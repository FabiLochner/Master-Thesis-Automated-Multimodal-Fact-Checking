Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on August 2, 2024, reports that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris greeted the freed Americans at Joint Base Andrews. The article mentions that the freed Americans emerged from the jet and were greeted by cheers. They lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base. <image:13442>, <image:13446>, <image:13444>.

The claim 'In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While Joe Biden did greet the freed Americans upon their arrival on August 1, 2024, at Joint Base Andrews, the evidence does not directly support the assertion that he boarded an empty plane after they exited. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo)) indicates that the freed Americans remained on the tarmac after exiting the plane. Although a Times of India article mentions Biden boarding a plane to thank the flight crew, it is unclear if it was the same aircraft.

So, the overall veracity is: false
