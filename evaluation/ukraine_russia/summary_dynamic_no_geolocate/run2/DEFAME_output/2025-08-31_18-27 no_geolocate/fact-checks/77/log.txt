The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations, as confirmed by sources like the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)). The parade commemorates Poland's victory over Soviet Russia, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war.

So, the overall veracity is: false
