Content: The Wikipedia article "8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine" describes a missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on July 8, 2024. The attacks resulted in at least 47 deaths and 189 injuries, including damage to the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv. The article includes images of the damage. <image:i>. The Russian government claimed the strikes targeted defense industry targets and aviation bases. The international community, including the UN and various countries, condemned the attacks.
