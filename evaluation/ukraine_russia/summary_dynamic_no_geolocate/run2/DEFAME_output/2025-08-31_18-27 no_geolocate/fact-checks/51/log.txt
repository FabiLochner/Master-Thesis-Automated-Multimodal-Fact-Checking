The claim 'In February 2025 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared a state of emergency in Germany due to US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checking reveals that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany in February 2025, as confirmed by a Euronews fact-check ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)). While Donald Trump was involved in Ukraine-related events during that time, there is no evidence to support the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
