The claim 'In February 2025 Elon Musk posted on X that he is planning to suspend Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s X account.' is not enough information.
Justification: The fact-check found that while Elon Musk criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy and X's fact-checking tools in February 2025, there is no evidence from sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html), and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html) to support the claim that he posted on X about suspending Zelenskyy's account.
