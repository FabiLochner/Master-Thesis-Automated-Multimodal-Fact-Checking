## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On August 20, 2024, Ukraine passed a law banning religious organizations with ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, which could effectively ban congregations of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The law, "On the Protection of the Constitutional Order in the Field of Activities of Religious Organizations," entered into force on September 23, 2024, and directly prohibits the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP). The European Parliament discussed the ban, mentioning concerns from the UN, Pope Francis, and others regarding potential violations of religious freedom and human rights.
