The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is misleading.
Justification: Following a call with Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, Donald Trump announced the initiation of peace talks and ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call). However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
