Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418): 
Content: Newsweek reports that Alex Jones claimed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian "hit list." <image:2102> White had posted on X in June 2024 that he was on a Ukrainian "Enemies List." The Austin Police Department stated that White was shot and killed in his apartment's parking lot, likely due to a car robbery gone wrong.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/): 
Content: The search result from StopFake.org states that there is no evidence Jamie White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine". It also mentions that White's sister and local police believe his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The article also mentions that White claimed to be on a "list of enemies of Ukraine" on his X account, but provided no evidence. <image:2108>

The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While Alex Jones claimed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian "hit list," and White himself claimed to be on a list, there is no evidence to support this. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/), there is no evidence White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine."

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
