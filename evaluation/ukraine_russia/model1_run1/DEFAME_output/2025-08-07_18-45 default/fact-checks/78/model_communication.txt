Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Content: "This might be intended to distract Russian forces.

“By launching surprise offensives across the thinly defended border, Ukraine can pursue operational-level guerrilla warfare to support an overall strategy of exhaustion,” [says Robert Rose](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/the-kursk-offensive-how-ukraines-operational-level-guerrilla-warfare-is-bringing-maneuver-back/)
 of the Modern War Institute at West Point.

Despite the gathering Russian counterattack in Kursk, and mounting Ukrainian losses, Zelensky insists the incursion into Kursk is necessary and valuable, and has slowed Russian advances in eastern Donetsk, where the city of Pokrovsk is under immediate threat. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is seeking to fully capture four eastern Ukrainian regions he already partly controls, and most of the fighting in the war has focused on this area.

Zelensky told Fareed Zakaria Friday that Russia’s [guided aerial bombs](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/10/europe/russian-guided-bomb-ukraine-frontline-intl/index.html)
, known as FABs, were responsible for 80% of destroyed infrastructure – and Ukraine urgently needed to hit the airfields from which they are launched.

This appeal appears to be gaining traction. [](#maincontent)

A [Russian counteroffensive](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/russia-launches-kursk-counteroffensive-intl/index.html)
 to recover parts of Kursk lost to Ukrainian forces following a surprise, cross-border attack is underway but is yet to gain momentum.

Ukraine launched its assault last month, capturing scores of settlements, a move that stunned even Kyiv’s allies. The officer said poor communications were hampering their operations.

Zelensky told a panel in Kyiv Friday moderated by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that Russia’s advantage in artillery ammunition in the Pokrovsk area had been cut from 12-to-1 to 2.5-to-1, which he attributed to the success of the Kursk campaign.

“The speed \[of the Russian advance\] in the Donetsk sector was even faster before the Kursk operation. The Kremlin appears to prioritize the goal of progress in Donetsk over retrieving lost Russian territory – for now.

The Ukrainians have offered several reasons for the Kursk operation – that it would force Russia to redeploy troops currently committed on the front-lines in Ukraine; that it would provide Ukraine with land to trade in any negotiations; that it would make a mockery of Putin’s ‘red lines’; and that it would provide a pool of prisoners-of-war to exchange (which it already has.)

Zelensky claims that the Kursk operation has shown [Putin’s warnings](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/world/putin-response-ukraine-kursk-intl/index.html)
 about the consequences of escalation to be hollow.

Zelensky has now added another justification for the Kursk offensive: that it forestalled a Russian plan to take a large swathe of northern Ukraine as a buffer zone, a plan that would have swallowed “regional centers.”

He told the Kyiv panel that “information from our partners” indicated that the Russians intended to create “security zones” deep inside Ukraine.

The ISW, a think-tank in Washington DC, said Friday that the Russian military command may have intended “additional offensive operations along a wider and more continuous front in northeastern Ukraine to significantly stretch Ukrainian forces.”

For now, such Russian ambitions are on hold. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at his meeting Friday with US President Joe Biden that “the next few weeks and months could be crucial – very, very important that we support Ukraine in this vital war of freedom.”

But the Biden Administration is wary of the consequences of what the Kremlin sees as an escalation that would bring NATO directly into the conflict.

The Kursk incursion may encourage Ukraine to develop another tool that “could fundamentally change Ukraine’s approach to fighting,” according to Rose at the Modern War Institute.

“Ukraine cannot use manoeuvre to achieve a decisive victory over Russia. What it can do is use manoeuvre to exploit vulnerabilities, force Russia to over-extend, create chaos, encircle Russian forces, and capture Russian equipment.”

The crux, according to Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven Associate Professor of National Security, is how Ukraine changes Putin’s decision-making, whether in Kursk or by much deeper strikes inside Russia, or both.

“Does it make him negotiate? Both the quality and number of Russian troops committed to the region are hazy, and reliable frontline accounts are few and far between.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the start of Russia’s counteoffensive and says it intends to deploy 60,000 – 70,000 troops in the Kursk region."

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>). Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, mentions the capture of German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region and includes the same image as the claim (<image:2769>). A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>). None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One source, from Wikipedia, details the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the White House seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. Another source, from CNN, discusses the incursion and a Russian counteroffensive. The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024.

The image <image:26>

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The web search confirms that there was an incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```

web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>). Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, mentions the capture of German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region and includes the same image as the claim (<image:2769>). A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>). None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One source, from Wikipedia, details the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the White House seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. Another source, from CNN, discusses the incursion and a Russian counteroffensive. The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024.

The image <image:26>

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The web search confirms that there was an incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss the incursion into the Kursk Oblast. The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:2790>

## Elaboration
The image search provides an image of a tank, but it does not match the image in the claim. The evidence still does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>). Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, mentions the capture of German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region and includes the same image as the claim (<image:2769>). A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>). None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One source, from Wikipedia, details the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the White House seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. Another source, from CNN, discusses the incursion and a Russian counteroffensive. The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024.

The image <image:26>

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The web search confirms that there was an incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

The image search provides an image of a tank, but it does not match the image in the claim. The evidence still does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August.

A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! By March of this year, their retreat was in full swing.

Anton: The catastrophe of retreat
---------------------------------

The situation on that day, 11 March, was described as "catastrophic" by "Anton".

The third soldier spoken to by the BBC was serving in the headquarters for the Kursk front.

He too highlighted the damage caused by Russian FPV drones. Drones are in the sky all the time."

The soldier predicted Ukraine's entire foothold in Kursk would be lost but that "from a military point of view, the Kursk direction has exhausted itself. There is no point in keeping it any more".

Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops."

We are an independent media outlet that relies solely on advertising revenue to sustain itself. These barriers are set up by the engineering troops of the Support Forces with the help of a tactical group in Kursk Oblast.

The Ukrainian military says Russian forces lost or damaged seven armored personnel carriers, seven infantry fighting vehicles, one “Tiger” armored vehicle, and five T-72 main battle tanks in October.

Russia lost the equipment due to the absence or poor execution of engineering reconnaissance, which should involve engineering units clearing and detecting mines. Ukrainian forces actively mine potential advance routes, deploying drones to drop mines on specific areas.

[Militarnyi](https://mil.in.ua/uk/news/rosiyany-zaznaly-vtrat-na-minnyh-zagorodzhennyah-zsu-na-kurshhyni/)
 reports that Ukrainian soldiers from the 36th Marine Brigade and the 1st Tank Brigade repelled a Russian assault in the Kursk Oblast recently. The Ukrainian brigade troops prepared their positions for the attack by mining the approach route that the Russians intended to use to reach Ukrainian positions.

Despite Russian troops’ significant advantage in armored vehicles, the Ukrainian soldiers organized well-coordinated protection, which the Russians were unable to breach with the small groups it sent for defense without proper engineering reconnaissance.

Earlier, the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry [Brigade](https://x.com/generalstaffua/status/1855174288531169646?s=46&t=4NUxblM5mUHCJhss421VWw)
, named after Yakiv Handziuk, together with the 21st Separate Special Operations Battalion of the Presidential Brigade, halted an assault on the southern outskirts of Krasnohorivka with unconventional mining.

During the battle, the lead Russian tank, equipped with the modern TMT-K mine roller, detonated on a mine, causing the assault column to stop and subsequently be destroyed.

You just retrieved web sources, each one summarized under "Web Sources". **Your task right now is to summarize the web source summaries.**

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>). Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, mentions the capture of German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region and includes the same image as the claim (<image:2769>). A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>). None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One source, from Wikipedia, details the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the White House seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. Another source, from CNN, discusses the incursion and a Russian counteroffensive. The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024.

The image <image:26>

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The web search confirms that there was an incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss the incursion into the Kursk Oblast. The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:2790>

## Elaboration
The image search provides an image of a tank, but it does not match the image in the claim. The evidence still does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>). Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, mentions the capture of German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region and includes the same image as the claim (<image:2769>). A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>). None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One source, from Wikipedia, details the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the White House seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. Another source, from CNN, discusses the incursion and a Russian counteroffensive. The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024.

The image <image:26>

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The web search confirms that there was an incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

The image in the claim (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>). Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, mentions the capture of German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region and includes the same image as the claim (<image:2769>). A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>). None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One source, from Wikipedia, details the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the White House seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion. Another source, from CNN, discusses the incursion and a Russian counteroffensive. The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024.

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. The web search confirms that there was an incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss the incursion into the Kursk Oblast. The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:2790>

## Elaboration
The image search provides an image of a tank, but it does not match the image in the claim. The evidence still does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Kursk campaign, which began on August 6, 2024, involving Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The BBC article, published on March 17, 2025, discusses the Ukrainian retreat from the Kursk region in August 2024 and includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance and subsequent Russian control (<image:2796>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. However, the image in the claim has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine, but not specifically in the context of the Kursk incursion. The additional searches did not provide any direct evidence to support the claim that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the Kursk incursion.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been used in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine, but not specifically in the context of the Kursk incursion. While the web searches confirm the incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, no direct evidence supports the claim that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during this specific event.

`not enough information`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim appears in articles discussing the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine, but not specifically in the context of the Kursk incursion. While the incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 is confirmed by multiple sources, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during this specific event. Therefore, the claim is marked as not enough information.
