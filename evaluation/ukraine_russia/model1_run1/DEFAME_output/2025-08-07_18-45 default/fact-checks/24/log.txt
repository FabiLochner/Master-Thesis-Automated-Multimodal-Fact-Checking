Useful result: From [Source](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/): 
Content: The article, published by Fortune, states that Howard G. Buffett, son of Warren Buffett, is on track to donate $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. His foundation has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine): 
Content: Business Insider published an article on February 24, 2024, stating that Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million to Ukraine in humanitarian aid. <image:508> The article mentions that Warren Buffett is the father of Howard Buffett.

The claim 'Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While Howard Buffett, not Warren Buffett, has donated substantial aid to Ukraine, with his foundation providing at least $520 million, the evidence does not support the claim that Warren Buffett himself has donated over $500 million.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
