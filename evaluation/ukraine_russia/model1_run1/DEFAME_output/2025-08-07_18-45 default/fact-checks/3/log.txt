Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html): 
Content: The search result from Ukrinform.net states that the cover of The Economist featuring Trump and Putin with the headline "Apocalypse" is a fake created by Russian propagandists. The article mentions that the fake cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of genuine Economist issues. The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, features a globe being struck by a golf club. <image:1577>, <image:1576>, <image:1579>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b): 
Content: The search result from PesaCheck, published on December 9, 2024, fact-checks a cover of The Economist featuring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. The article states that the cover is altered and was not published by The Economist. <image:2> The original cover from March 16, 2024, did not include the images of Trump and Putin.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/): 
Content: The search result from AAP FactCheck states that the image is a fake cover of The Economist magazine. The cover depicts Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin with the headline "APOCALYPSE". The article mentions several spelling mistakes in the cover lines and that the cover was shared on social media and pushed by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel. The article was published on November 28, 2024, by David Williams. <image:1580>, <image:1581>, <image:2>.

The claim '<image:2> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic cover of the magazine The Economist from the end of 2024 illustrating Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and warning of an apocalypse.' is false.
Justification: The image of The Economist cover depicting Trump and Putin with the headline "Apocalypse" is a fabrication. Multiple fact-checking sources, including Ukrinform.net, PesaCheck, and AAP FactCheck, confirm the image's inauthenticity, highlighting that the actual cover from November 16, 2024, featured a different image and that the fake cover contains spelling errors and was promoted by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
