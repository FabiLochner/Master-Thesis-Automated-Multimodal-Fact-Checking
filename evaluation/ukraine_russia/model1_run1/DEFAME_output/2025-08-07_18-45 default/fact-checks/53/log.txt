Useful result: From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025):

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that as of early June 2024, Russia claimed 6,465 Ukrainian soldiers were still held prisoner in Russia. The article also mentions that according to a Western official, by August 2024, the daily average of Russian military casualties in the conflict was about 1,000 soldiers. In July 2024, Sir Roland Walker said that it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. The article also states that as of 29 July 2025, 5,432 Russian officers had been killed.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The search result from Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses in the war with Ukraine. The last update of the Probate Registry estimate was February 24, 2025, with an estimate as of December 2024. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners dropped to between 2â€“3%. The article was last updated on August 1, 2025.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing, this figure does not align with the 1.5 million troop loss stated in the claim. Other sources also provide casualty figures, but none support the claim's specific number.

So, the overall veracity is: false
