Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on November 20, 2024, debunks the claim that Mark Rutte threatened to expel the US from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin. The article states that NATO has no mechanism to expel a member and that a spokesperson called the claim "bogus". The article also mentions that Rutte congratulated Trump on his victory and emphasized the importance of the US's leadership within NATO. <image:1>

The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
