Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article on August 15, 2024, about Poland's military parade. The parade was part of the annual observances on Poland's armed forces holiday in Warsaw, Poland. <image:25>, <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland)): 
Content: The search result is from Wikipedia and discusses Armed Forces Day in Poland, celebrated annually on August 15. It commemorates the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. The day includes military parades, equipment reviews, and commemorations. The article mentions that in 2019, the parade took place in Katowice. <image:25> is not present in the search result.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade): 
Content: The Polish Ministry of Defence announced a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17. The parade will showcase military hardware, including South Korean-made K2 battle tanks, Polish-produced Krab self-propelled gun-howitzers, and US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks. The event is an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East." <image:25>

The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is misleading.
Justification: The image depicts a military parade in Poland, which was part of the annual Armed Forces Day observances. The parade took place on August 15, 2024, not August 14, as the claim states. While the parade showcased military hardware and expressed unity in the face of "threats from the East" ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/poland-military-parade-warsaw-russia-ukraine-099696999999)), the evidence does not explicitly state that it was preparing for war with Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
