Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html): 
Content: Yahoo News reports that Zelenskyy did make a statement about the U.S. having to send their sons and daughters to war, but it was in a hypothetical context. The statement was made two years before the February 2025 White House meeting. The article references a Snopes fact-check. <image:i>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118): 
Content: DW.com published a fact-check article discussing disinformation related to a meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump, and JD Vance. The article addresses the claim that Zelenskyy "demanded" the US send its "sons and daughters" to fight in Ukraine. The article states that Zelenskyy said, "If Ukraine loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO states, then the US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly in the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war." The article also mentions a video clip of Zelenskyy making this statement. <image:x>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186): 
Content: The Times Now News article, published on March 3, 2025, reports on an old video of Zelenskyy discussing NATO Article 5. The article quotes Zelenskyy saying, "The US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending sons and daughters to war." The article also mentions a heated conversation between Zelenskyy and Trump in the Oval Office. <image:i>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy did state that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to war, as reported by [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) and [Times Now News](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186), the context of the statement was a discussion about NATO Article 5, not a heated exchange with Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
