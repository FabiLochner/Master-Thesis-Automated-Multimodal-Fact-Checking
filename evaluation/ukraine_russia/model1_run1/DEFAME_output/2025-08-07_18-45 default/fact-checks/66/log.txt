Useful result: From [Source](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/06/russia-china-simulate-attack-on-enemy-submarine-in-sea-of-japan-drills): 
Content: The search result from USNI News, published on August 6, 2025, reports on joint military drills between Russia and China in the Sea of Japan. The drills included anti-submarine warfare, joint firing exercises, and submarine rescue simulations. Japan's Joint Staff Office (JSO) issued releases about Russian and PLAN ships transiting near Japan. <image:k>

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is not enough information.
Justification: The evidence reveals that China and Russia have increased military cooperation, including joint drills in the Sea of Japan, which raises security concerns for Japan. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The historical conflicts, such as the [Russo-Japanese War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War), and current geopolitical dynamics do not indicate a planned invasion.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
