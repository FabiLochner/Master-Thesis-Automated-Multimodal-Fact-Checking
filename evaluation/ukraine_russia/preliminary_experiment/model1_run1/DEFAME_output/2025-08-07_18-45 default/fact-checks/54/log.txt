Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine): 
Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) published an article on July 15, 2025, discussing U.S. aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid, with military aid being a significant portion. The article mentions that the U.S. has provided weapons systems, training, and intelligence. It also notes that dozens of other countries are providing large aid packages to Ukraine. The article does not provide any statistics on arms sales by Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-numbers): 
Content: The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides data on U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including announcements and deliveries of weapons. <image:2280>, <image:2281>. The article does not mention Ukraine selling armaments.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian): 
Content: The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on March 10, 2025, that Ukraine was the world's biggest arms importer in 2020–24, with the USA being the main supplier (45%). The article does not mention Ukraine selling armaments.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is not enough information.
Justification: The investigation found evidence of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine, but no specific data to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While sources like the [Harvard International Review](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/) and the [Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/) discuss arms trafficking, and the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine) and [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-numbers) provide data on U.S. aid, none of the sources provide information on the volume of arms sales by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
