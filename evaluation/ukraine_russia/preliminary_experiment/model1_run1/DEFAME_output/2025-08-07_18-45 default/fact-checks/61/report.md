## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there was an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines in Moscow. However, the evidence does not confirm that Putin was in the limousine or that he died in the explosion. The Sun reported no injuries were reported.

The Kyiv Post reported a fire near the FSB headquarters, with the fire thought to have started in the engine. The Economic Times reported the explosion raised security concerns.

Therefore, the claim that Putin died in an explosion in his limousine is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, but it does not confirm that Putin was in the vehicle or that he died. The reports mention security concerns and a fire, but no injuries were reported.

The claim that Vladimir Putin died in an explosion in his limousine is demonstrably false because the evidence does not support this assertion. `false`
