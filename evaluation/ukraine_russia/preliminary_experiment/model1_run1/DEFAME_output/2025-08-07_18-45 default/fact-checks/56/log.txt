Useful result: From [Source](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-totally-false-actor-ben-stiller-debunks-claims-usaid-funded-ukraine-trip-231285317684): 
Content: MSNBC's "Morning Joe" reports that Ben Stiller debunked claims that his trip to Ukraine was funded by USAID. <image:1>. The report states that Elon Musk amplified the false claim on social media. The report was published in February.

The claim '<image:17> This image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, for which Stiller received $4 million from USAID.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Ben Stiller did meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 20, 2022, as confirmed by sources like [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989), [The New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/), and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351), there is no evidence to support the assertion that he received $4 million from USAID. Stiller himself denied receiving any such funds, and sources like [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb) and MSNBC confirm that he self-funded the trip.

So, the overall veracity is: false
