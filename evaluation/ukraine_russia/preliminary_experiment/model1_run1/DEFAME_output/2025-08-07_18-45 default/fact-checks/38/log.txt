The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a Pennsylvania ammunition plant and met with Kamala Harris, leading to accusations of election interference, there is no direct evidence that he was campaigning for her. The claim relies on interpretations of his actions by political figures, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/europe/ukraine-zelensky-pennsylvania-us-visit-intl-hnk) and [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/zelenskyy-insulted-him-house-gop-to-probe-ukraine-leaders-pa-trip-.html).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
