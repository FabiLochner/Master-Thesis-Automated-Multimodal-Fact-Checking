Newsweek reports that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions plant in Pennsylvania. NBC News mentions that some Republicans viewed Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania as a signal of his preference in the November election. ABC News reports on a meeting between Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy. Representative James Comer is investigating the matter.

To fully verify the claim, further information is needed to determine the nature of Zelenskyy's actions and whether they were intended to influence the election.
