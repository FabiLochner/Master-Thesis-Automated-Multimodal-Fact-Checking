## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 8](media/10.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Russian attacks on Ukraine on July 8, 2024, including the attack on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv. Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, stating the attack killed at least 42 civilians, including five children (<image:k>). The United Nations website reports the attack as a war crime, mentioning severe damage to the hospital's intensive care, surgical, and oncology wards (![image 8](media/10.jpg)).

The Wikipedia article details the strikes on Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk, resulting in at least 47 deaths and 189 injuries, including damage to the Okhmatdyt children's hospital (![image 8](media/10.jpg)). The attacks were condemned by the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. The Russian defense ministry claimed the strikes targeted defense industry targets and aviation bases.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image shows the aftermath of the attack, with debris and rescue workers present. The presence of children's toys in the image is consistent with the hospital being a children's facility.

The claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified or refuted with the available evidence. The evidence does not provide information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.
