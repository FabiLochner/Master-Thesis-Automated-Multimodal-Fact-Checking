### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, officially titled the Securing Our Future London Summit, was held on March 2, 2025, in London, hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The summit aimed to create a "coalition of the willing" to present a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit resulted in a four-point plan and commitments, including £1.6 billion in UK export finances for air defense missiles manufactured in Belfast and a £2.2 billion loan for military aid to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets. The summit followed a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The summit was attended by several European leaders, including Volodymyr Zelensky, Keir Starmer, and Emmanuel Macron. Reuters reports on the summit, mentioning that Russian parliamentarians dismissed the summit, stating it produced no plan to settle the war in Ukraine. ![image 9](media/12.jpg) ![image 1760](media/2025-08-07_19-05-1754593501-202220.jpg) ![image 1761](media/2025-08-07_19-05-1754593510-965201.jpg)
