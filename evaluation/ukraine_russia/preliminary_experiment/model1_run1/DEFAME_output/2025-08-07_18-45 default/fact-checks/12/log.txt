The summit followed a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump. <image:9>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2025/03/02/standing-united-in-support-of-ukraine): 
Content: The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, participated in the Securing our Future Summit in London, United Kingdom, on March 2, 2025. The summit, hosted by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer, brought together Euro-Atlantic and NATO leaders to support Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-peace-talks-ukraine-key-takeaways-london-summit): 
Content: The Guardian published an article about the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, hosted by Keir Starmer. The article mentions the attendance of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron, and other leaders. <image:1762> The article does not mention leaders taking off their suits. The article was published more than 5 months ago.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, cannot be verified. While the summit did occur and was attended by several leaders, including Zelenskyy, Starmer, and Macron, the provided evidence, including image and web searches, does not mention or depict leaders removing their suits.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
