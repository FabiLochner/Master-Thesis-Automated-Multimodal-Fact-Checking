## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his White House visit in April 2025 is false. StopFake.org states that the claim is a fake, and the article includes a screenshot of a Facebook post. The Soufan Center published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House, but it does not mention the resettlement plans. The Jerusalem Post published an article on August 2, 2025, about a bilateral dinner between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. StopFake.org explicitly labels the claim as a fake. The Soufan Center's Intelbrief from April 9, 2025, does not mention the resettlement plans. Additionally, the Jerusalem Post reported on a White House meeting in July 2025, which also makes no mention of the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is a fabrication. StopFake.org identifies the claim as false, and other sources about the time period do not mention the alleged plans.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/), the claim is a fake. Furthermore, neither the [Soufan Center's Intelbrief](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/) nor a Jerusalem Post article about a later White House meeting mention such plans.
