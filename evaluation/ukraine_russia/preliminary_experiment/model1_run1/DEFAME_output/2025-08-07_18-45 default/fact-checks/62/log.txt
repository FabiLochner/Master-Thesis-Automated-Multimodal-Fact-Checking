Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/houthis-say-group-downed-us-drone-in-northwest-yemen-as-us-strikes-continue): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that the Houthis said they shot down a US drone in the Hajjah governorate in Yemen. <image:i>. The article was published on April 22, 2025. The Houthis claim this is the seventh US drone downed this month and the 22nd since the start of the war in Gaza. The US has been carrying out air attacks against Houthi targets since March, killing more than 200 people.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While the Houthis have shot down U.S. drones, the image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in Israel, not in a location related to the Houthis' actions. The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/houthis-us-warships-red-sea-e6e97a7131c48640ccf74b1916628234](https://apnews.com/article/houthis-us-warships-red-sea-e6e97a7131c48640ccf74b1916628234)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/houthis-shoot-growing-number-us-drones/story?id=121099082](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/houthis-shoot-growing-number-us-drones/story?id=121099082)) confirm that the Houthis have shot down U.S. drones.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
