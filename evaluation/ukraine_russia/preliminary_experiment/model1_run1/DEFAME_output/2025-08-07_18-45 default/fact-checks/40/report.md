## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Independent published an article discussing Elon Musk's criticism of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his intention to "fix" X's Community Notes feature, published after February 20, 2025. ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html)) ![image 2109](media/2025-08-07_19-40-1754595652-033521.jpg)

Tasnim News Agency reported on February 21, 2025, that Musk pledged to "fix" X's fact-checking tool and criticized Zelenskyy. ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/02/21/3261980/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-zelenskyy](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/02/21/3261980/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-zelenskyy)) ![image 2110](media/2025-08-07_19-41-1754595664-621608.jpg) Neither article mentions Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.


## Elaboration
The new evidence from the web search further corroborates that Elon Musk was critical of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and X's fact-checking tools in February 2025. However, similar to the previous findings, there is no mention of Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Actions
```
web_search("Elon Musk X Zelenskyy account suspension February 2025")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The search results consistently show that Elon Musk criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy and X's fact-checking tools in February 2025. However, none of the provided evidence supports the claim that Musk posted on X about planning to suspend Zelenskyy's account.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Elon Musk was critical of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and X's fact-checking tools in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that he posted on X about planning to suspend Zelenskyy's account. Multiple searches and sources confirm Musk's criticisms but do not mention any plans for account suspension.

`not enough information`


### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The fact-check found that while Elon Musk criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy and X's fact-checking tools in February 2025, there is no evidence from sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html), and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html) to support the claim that he posted on X about suspending Zelenskyy's account.
