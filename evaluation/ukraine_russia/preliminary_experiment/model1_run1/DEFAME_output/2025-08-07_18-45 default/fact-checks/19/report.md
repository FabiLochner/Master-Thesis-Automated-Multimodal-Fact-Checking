From [Source](https://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2024/11/19/meloni-understands-us-response-to-russian-aggression_e892a764-bcb7-4700-ba23-bb28bc9262cf.html): 
Content: The ANSA English news published on November 19, 2024, reports that Giorgia Meloni "understands" the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia. (<image:k>) Meloni stated that Italy made a different choice and that Italy's policy of only allowing Kyiv to use the arms aid Rome sends it in Ukrainian territory has not changed. The article also mentions Meloni's focus on anti-aircraft defense and her understanding of other nations' viewpoints.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence confirms that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.
2.  Meloni stated that she understood the US's decision regarding Ukraine's use of long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice.
3.  The evidence does not support the claim that Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Instead, it suggests a nuanced position where she understood the US's stance while maintaining Italy's policy.

**Conclusion**: The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni discussed the US's stance on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles inside Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. She stated that Italy made a different choice, but the evidence does not explicitly state that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `not enough information`


### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The available evidence, including reports from the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, indicates that Giorgia Meloni expressed understanding of the US's position on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles inside Russia, while Italy maintained a different approach ([https://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2024/11/19/meloni-understands-us-response-to-russian-aggression_e892a764-bcb7-4700-ba23-bb28bc9262cf.html](https://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2024/11/19/meloni-understands-us-response-to-russian-aggression_e892a764-bcb7-4700-ba23-bb28bc9262cf.html)). However, there is no evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.
