Content: The search result from Wikipedia discusses the 2019 Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, including allegations that Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. It mentions that Mick Mulvaney said one reason for withholding aid to Ukraine was Ukrainian "corruption related to the DNC server". The article also mentions that Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden joined the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. The article also mentions that Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son. The article also mentions that the Trump administration released the aid on September 11. The article also mentions that John Bolton wrote in a draft of his forthcoming book that the president told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in aid to Ukraine until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. The article also mentions that George Stephanopoulos described the details of the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory as "both convoluted and false".

Content: Newsweek published an article that fact-checks the claim that half of US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates. The article states that multiple tweets claimed that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party. The article mentions that the claim has been spread by right-leaning commentators and politicians. The article states that the claim is unevidenced and that there is no tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding was laundered. The article also mentions that funding for Ukraine received bipartisan support. <image:2147>

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380): 
Content: The Associated Press published a fact check on the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates. The article states that Russian influencers promoted this narrative. The Ukrainian government never invested any funds into FTX. Aid For Ukraine began taking donations to help the Ukrainian war effort. FTX's co-CEO also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates. The AP'S ASSESSMENT: False.

The claim 'Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election.' is false.

Fact-checks from both [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380) debunk the assertion that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and funneled to Democrat candidates.
