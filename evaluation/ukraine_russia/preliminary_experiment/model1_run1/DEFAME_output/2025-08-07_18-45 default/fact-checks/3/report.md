## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of The Economist cover featuring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin with the headline "Apocalypse" is a fake. Ukrinform.net ([https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html)) states that the cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of genuine Economist issues. The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, features a globe being struck by a golf club.
