Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-tries-accuse-it-false-war-crimes-kursk-2024-08-12/): 
Content: Reuters reports that Russia claimed Ukrainian forces used shells containing chemical weapons during the Kursk offensive in August 2024, but Reuters could not independently verify the claim. <image:1908> The article also mentions that the SBU (Ukraine's State Security Service) stated that Russia might stage crimes and blame Ukraine. The article was published on August 12, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-bolstered-by-north-korean-troops-presses-attacks-in-kursk-region/33243288.html): 
Content: The search result from RFE/RL, published on December 17, 2024, discusses the intensified offensive by Russian forces, bolstered by North Korean troops, against Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. <image:1909> The article mentions that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk. The article also mentions a joint statement by the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) vowing continued support for Ukraine and calling on third countries, including North Korea, to cease supporting Russia's aggression.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there are reports of a chemical attack during the Kursk offensive, the image's origin and the nature of the explosion are not confirmed. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine, Jordan, or Ukraine. The claim misrepresents the origin and content of the image.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
