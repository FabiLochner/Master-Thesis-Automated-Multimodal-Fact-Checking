Content: The search result is a Hull Daily Mail front page from February 18, 2025. <image:1522>

The claim '<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Hull Daily Mail did publish an edition on March 13, 2025, the front page image is fabricated. The actual front page, as shown by sources like [Magzter](https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2), does not contain the text about Ukrainian soldiers. This is further supported by a fact-check from mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/](https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/)), which labels the image as fabricated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
