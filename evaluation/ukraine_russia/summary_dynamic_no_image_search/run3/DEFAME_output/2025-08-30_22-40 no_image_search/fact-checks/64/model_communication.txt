Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told [Ukraine's military allies](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 in Brussels that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders - before Russia annexed Crimea - was unrealistic and that the U.S. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

The **Soviet invasion of Manchuria**, formally known as the **Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation**[\[15\]](#cite_note-22)
 or simply the **Manchurian Operation** (Маньчжурская операция) and sometimes **Operation August Storm**,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 began on 9 August 1945 with the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 invasion of the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan")
's [puppet state](/wiki/Puppet_state "Puppet state")
 of [Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo")
, which was situated in Japanese-occupied [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria")
. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Drea-24)
 They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully [concealing the buildup](/wiki/Russian_military_deception "Russian military deception")
 of a force of 90 divisions. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan's surrender.[\[38\]](#cite_note-46)
 Japanese forces were overwhelmed by Soviet attacks. Another group of Japanese women that were with Ikeda Hiroko that on 15 August tried to flee to Harbin but returned to their settlements were raped by Soviet soldiers.[\[79\]](#cite_note-87)

The [Kwantung Army](/wiki/Kwantung_Army "Kwantung Army")
 of the [Imperial Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army "Imperial Japanese Army")
, under General [Otozo Yamada](/wiki/Otozo_Yamada "Otozo Yamada")
, was the major part of the Japanese occupation forces in Manchuria and Korea, and consisted of two Area Armies and three independent armies:[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)

*   [First Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_First_Area_Army "Japanese First Area Army")
     (northeastern Manchukuo), including:
    *   [3rd Army](/wiki/Japanese_Third_Army "Japanese Third Army")
        
    *   [5th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Fifth_Army "Japanese Fifth Army")
        
*   [Third Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_Third_Area_Army "Japanese Third Area Army")
     (southwestern Manchukuo), including:
    *   [30th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Thirtieth_Army "Japanese Thirtieth Army")
        
    *   [44th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Forty-Fourth_Army "Japanese Forty-Fourth Army")
        
*   Independent units:
    *   [4th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Fourth_Army "Japanese Fourth Army")
         (an independent field army responsible for northern Manchuria)
    *   [34th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Thirty-Fourth_Army "Japanese Thirty-Fourth Army")
         (an independent field army responsible for the areas between the Third and Seventeenth Area Armies in northern Korea)
    *   [Seventeenth Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_Seventeenth_Area_Army "Japanese Seventeenth Area Army")
         (responsible for Korea; assigned to the Kwantung Army at the eleventh hour, to no avail)

Each _Area Army_ (_Homen Gun_, the equivalent of a [Western](/wiki/Western_world "Western world")
 "army") had headquarters units and units attached directly to the Area Army, in addition to the field armies (the equivalent of a Western corps). Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks.[\[39\]](#cite_note-47)
 The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.[\[40\]](#cite_note-48)

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die.[\[41\]](#cite_note-49)
 From the Russians' perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia's defeat in the [Russo-Japanese War](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War "Russo-Japanese War")
 of 1905.[\[42\]](#cite_note-50)
 The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing "Beijing")
 by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.[\[43\]](#cite_note-51)

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on."

The Soviet Union invaded the Empire of Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo on August 9, 1945, as part of World War II. The invasion, known as the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, caught the Japanese by surprise. The Kwantung Army, the main Japanese force in the area, was unprepared. The Soviets employed a large-scale pincer movement, with the 2nd Far Eastern Front playing a supporting role. The Japanese forces, including the Kwantung Army, were overwhelmed. The Soviets captured Japanese soldiers and civilians, with many being sent to labor camps in Siberia. The invasion resulted in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region.

The Russian military has identified 160 priority targets in [Japan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/japan?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 and [South Korea](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-korea?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 in the event of a conflict with [Nato](https://www.scmp.com/topics/nato?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 expanding into East Asia, according to secret documents obtained by the Financial Times.

While many targets include legitimate military sites like airfields, radar installations and naval installations, the list also features civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants, factories, and transport tunnels.

Deliberately attacking such civilian sites, in the same way Russian forces have done in [Ukraine](https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine?module=inline&pgtype=article)
, would constitute a war crime, one analyst said.

In a story published on Tuesday, the British paper reported on 29 leaked Russian military documents used for training officers for potential conflicts in northeastern Asia, shared by “Western sources.”

Although the documents are dated from 2008 to 2014, James Brown, an international relations professor at Temple University in Tokyo, who specialises in Russian affairs, told This Week in Asia that the core elements of Russian strategy and targeting data are likely to remain relevant, albeit updated and enhanced with more recent information.

> It’s obvious why radar facilities and airbases would be targets, but nuclear power plants? Road and rail tunnels?

James Brown, analyst

“Of course, the Russians will have plans for targets in the event of a war breaking out because they need to know what they have to hit,” Brown said.

Russian and Chinese naval vessels plan to conduct a joint patrol in the Asia Pacific region, following recent [exercises in the Sea of Japan](/news/2025/8/3/china-and-russia-begin-joint-military-drills-in-sea-of-japan)
, Russia’s official Interfax has reported.

Citing a statement on Wednesday from the Russian Pacific Fleet’s press service, Interfax said that ships from the Russian Navy and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy “will form a new task group to carry out joint patrol missions in the Asia-Pacific region”.

“After replenishing supplies from logistics vessels, the crews of the Russian Navy and the PLA Navy will form a new detachment to carry out joint patrol tasks in the Asia-Pacific region,” the news agency said.

Russia is conducting a series of military exercises with China in response to the build-up of US military potential in the Asia Pacific region, Interfax said, citing Russia’s chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, in 2022.

Moscow and Beijing have already conducted joint air patrols in the Asia Pacific region since 2019, it added.

The joint patrol announcement comes as the two countries conclude five days of joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan that focused on anti-submarine and air defence missions.

During the final phase of the exercises, Russia’s large anti-submarine ship Admiral Tributs and the corvette Gromky, together with the Chinese destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, carried out live-fire drills while crews practised searching for and neutralising a mock enemy submarine, Interfax reported.

Russia’s Pacific Fleet earlier said that the drills were defensive in nature and not directed against any other countries.

The reported formation of the Asia Pacific joint patrol comes as China modernises and upgrades its naval fleet to become a “blue water” force, capable of carrying out long-range operations in the world’s oceans, similar to the United States and other Western forces.

[Russia and China](/news/2024/9/10/china-russia-to-conduct-joint-naval-and-air-drills-this-month)
, which signed a “no-limits” strategic partnership shortly before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, conduct regular exercises to rehearse coordination between their armed forces and send a deterrent signal to adversaries.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15. 

[Fact Check](https://thedispatch.com/category/fact-check/)

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)
, which has been associated with prior Russian information operations, then translates and distributes the Telegram posts.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating "immoral" and "corrupt" conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)
[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

, his deputy Gabe Sterling, and Arizona House of Representatives speaker [Rusty Bowers](/wiki/Rusty_Bowers "Rusty Bowers")
.[\[123\]](#cite_note-123)
 The second half of the hearing focused on Trump supporters' harassment of and threats to Georgia poll worker [Wandrea' ArShaye Moss](/wiki/Wandrea%27_ArShaye_Moss "Wandrea' ArShaye Moss")
 and her family, which led her to quit her job and go into hiding.[\[124\]](#cite_note-124)

Schiff was interviewed after the hearing by reporters and called the testimony "enormously powerful".[\[125\]](#cite_note-125)
 He added, "The lie lives on, and with it so does the danger."

In April 2018, when asked whether he thought Trump deserved at least partial credit for North Korea's involvement in talks with the U.S., Schiff replied: "I think it's more than fair to say that the combination of the president's unpredictability and indeed his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the negotiating table".[\[99\]](#cite_note-99)

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

----------- Zhou said that “it is impossible for Beijing to stand by idly” in the face of deteriorating relations between Russia and the US, but that there was space to strengthen the policies governing the control of nuclear weapons stockpiles.

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

US shifts nuclear focus to counter China’s growing arsenal
==========================================================

[Amrita Jash](/the-interpreter/contributors/articles/amrita-jash)

Beijing’s nuclear modernisation means its intentions and commitments to non-proliferation will continue to be questioned.

Listen to this article

[_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.WlFr.MEPeOr7CqMnA&smid=url-share)
 has reported that in March, US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States. The paper goes on to say that for the first time, America’s deterrent strategy has reoriented to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, as it also seeks to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.

This shift in Washington’s policy comes after a Pentagon assessment that over the next decade China’s nuclear arsenal stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of those in the United States and Russia. It has been accused of transferring nuclear and missile technology to proliferators such as Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran, leading the Biden administration to [impose stricter export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-tightens-export-controls-nuclear-power-items-china-2023-08-18/)
 on nuclear materials and technology to China.

These developments underscore that as China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come. The Russia-Ukraine war has only reinforced this idea.

This modernisation also puts a spotlight on China’s commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation norms.

### [Seoul will struggle to find currency for Pyongyang talks](/the-interpreter/seoul-will-struggle-find-currency-pyongyang-talks)

Without economic incentives or offering entree to the White House, South Korea could find itself sidelined in North Korea diplomacy. In its [Annual Report to Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
 last year, the US Department of Defence highlighted two key aspects of China’s nuclear capabilities: First, that China has more than 500 active nuclear weapons, exceeding earlier estimates of 400 warheads, and following [earlier assessments](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-Military-AndSecurity-Developments-Involving-The-Peoples-Republic-Of-China.pdf)
 is expected to have a stockpile of about 1,500 warheads by 2035; and second, that in keeping with its modernisation objectives, China is expected to have more than 1,000 operable nuclear weapons by 2030, many of which will probably be “deployed at higher readiness levels”.

A White House spokesperson was careful to say the new plan was “not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat” and that the guidance provided, while secret, was in keeping with actions taken by earlier administrations.

Beijing, however, raised “grave concerns” over the reported plan, with [China’s Foreign Ministry](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202408/t20240821_11477550.html)
 declaring “the US has called China a ‘nuclear threat’ and used it as a convenient pretext to shirk its obligation of nuclear disarmament, expand its own nuclear arsenal, and seek absolute strategic predominance.”

China has restated its “no first use” policy, saying it has “no intention to engage in any form of arms race with other countries”, while accusing the United States of being “the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world”. Beijing said Washington would be better to make “drastic and substantive cuts to its nuclear arsenal”, and to stop “nuclear sharing” and other “negative moves that undermine global and regional peace and stability”.

As China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come.

Of the nine nuclear-armed powers, China has one of the fastest-growing nuclear arsenals at present. So, to state that China seeks to have parity with the United States or Russia cannot be blithely dismissed. Any increase in China’s nuclear stockpile raises serious concerns, given the opaque nature of the country’s nuclear capabilities and its modernisation ambitions. China’s intentions continue to be guided by Deng Xiaoping’s observations that nuclear force enhancements were necessary “[to earn more say and a higher international status in a coming world order](https://www.academia.edu/23440377/The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments_The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments)

Content: "plan approved by President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.

The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington's deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, the _Times_ said.

KCNA said North Korea's foreign ministry "expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S."

It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its sovereignty.

Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Pyongyang, which has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia as "absurd."

However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.

China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral party in Russia's offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.

But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war.

Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.

Seoul, South Korea —
