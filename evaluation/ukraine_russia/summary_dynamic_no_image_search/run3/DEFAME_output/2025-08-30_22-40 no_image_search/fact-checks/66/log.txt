Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria): 
Content: The Soviet Union invaded the Empire of Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo on August 9, 1945, as part of World War II. The invasion, known as the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, caught the Japanese by surprise. The Kwantung Army, the main Japanese force in the area, was unprepared. The Soviets employed a large-scale pincer movement, with the 2nd Far Eastern Front playing a supporting role. The Japanese forces, including the Kwantung Army, were overwhelmed. The Soviets captured Japanese soldiers and civilians, with many being sent to labor camps in Siberia. The invasion resulted in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea): 
Content: The South China Morning Post published an article on January 1, 2025, discussing leaked Russian military documents. The documents reveal plans to target 160 sites in Japan and South Korea, including civilian infrastructure. <image:3874> The article mentions that the documents are dated from 2008 to 2014.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/russia-china-naval-forces-to-carry-out-joint-asia-pacific-patrol-report): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that Russian and Chinese naval vessels plan to conduct a joint patrol in the Asia Pacific region. <image:k> The announcement follows joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan. The drills focused on anti-submarine and air defense missions. The article was published on August 6, 2025.

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The evidence does not support the claim. The search results mention the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, leaked Russian military documents targeting Japan and South Korea, and joint naval patrols between Russia and China, but none of these sources mention any invasion plans by China or Japan against Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
