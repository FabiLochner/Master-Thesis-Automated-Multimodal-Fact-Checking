## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) mentions that President Trump froze military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, but lifted the freeze shortly after. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) discusses the Trump administration's military aid to Ukraine, including weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, in addition to $310 million approved in May. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. provided approximately $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). The claim states that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim is not supported. The evidence suggests a much lower figure for military aid.

To verify the claim, I would need information on the total military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The claim states that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The evidence does not support the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence.
