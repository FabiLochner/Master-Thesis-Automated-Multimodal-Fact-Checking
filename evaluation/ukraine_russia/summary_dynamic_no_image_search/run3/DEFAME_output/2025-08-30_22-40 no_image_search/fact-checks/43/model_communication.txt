Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)
, [Calvin Robinson](https://twitter.com/calvinrobinson/status/1592031504875544577)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)
, and shaking the industry as a whole.

To understand if and how its demise is connected to U.S. dollar, though that may be no longer [tenable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-slips-from-1-peg/)
).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

These include (but are not limited to) verification of cash assistance, using regulated money transfer agents, and using security-locked beneficiary lists before they are disseminated.

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

The article also mentions that Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, joined the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company.

Content: "REUTERS [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
. 

The Mueller probe catalyzed further inquires by House Democrats in Congress and continues to be mentioned in [discussions on the escalating Ukraine scandal](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/464845-house-lawyer-says-impeachment-probe-could-go-beyond-ukraine)
 that's sparked an [impeachment inquiry into Trump.](https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-announce-trump-impeachment-inquiry-2019-9)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Top political, business and sporting figures reeling from their offshore banking activities making the front pages of newspapers around the world got a backhanded boost from an unlikely source on Wednesday.

French satire magazine "Charlie Hebdo" depicted a caricatured group of cigar-smoking people holding signs reading "Je suis Panama," "Don't be afraid," and "They won't change our way of life."

Headlined "Tax Terrorism," the cover recycled many of the declarations of solidarity made following the terrorist attack at the French magazine in January 2015 that killed 11 people. The French phrase "Je suis," or "I am," followed by a city name after terrorist attacks or by a social cause has gone on to be used on social media on several occasions.

Je suis Panama was not the only time the Paris-based magazine recently grabbed attention. An [editorial published in last week's edition](https://charliehebdo.fr/en/edito/how-did-we-end-up-here/)
 was widely regarded as blaming all Muslims for Islamist terrorism. The magazine's cover, addressing the Brussels terror attacks, also came under fire.

From [Source](https://babel.ua/en/news/118302-charlie-hebdo-magazine-sued-over-fake-covers-mocking-ukraine): Found exact image on website with title: Charlie Hebdo magazine sued over fake covers mocking Ukraine
Content: "French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has filed a complaint in a Paris court alleging that its covers, which mock Ukraine, and in particular President Volodymyr Zelensky, are fake.

This [is reported](https://charliehebdo.fr/2025/05/societe/justice/non-poutine-nest-pas-le-nouveau-directeur-de-charlie-hebdo/)
 on the magazineʼs website.

“ʼCover art’ that mimics the style of the publication and unceremoniously uses the signatures of its artists is appearing on the Internet. Who is behind this deception? We don’t know yet, so we have filed a complaint against an unidentified person. All of these clumsy fakes have one thing in common: they denigrate Ukraine, ridicule European support for President Volodymyr Zelensky, and sometimes spread rumors about the gender identity of \[French First Lady\] Brigitte Macron. You start to wonder if Putin himself ordered them,” the magazine said.

  

An example of a fake cover spread allegedly by Charlie Hebdo. The characters are Volodymyr Zelensky, French and US presidents Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump.

In the complaint, the magazine [notes](https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/charlie-hebdo-porte-plainte-contre-x-apres-la-publication-de-fausses-unes-pro-poutine-20250526)
 that over the past two years, at least 15 fake magazine covers with comments and captions in Russian have been published on Telegram and the social network X. According to the Charlie Hebdo editorial team, the covers are designed for a Russian audience to create the impression that Charlie Hebdo supports Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

"The authors of the hoax hope to make people think that Charlie Hebdo is a pro-Putin and anti-Zeleno newspaper. Propaganda is working at full capacity, and it would be a mistake to continue to underestimate its harmful influence," the publishers stressed.

Fake Charlie Hebdo cover.

So Charlie Hebdoʼs editorial board went to court to "dispel the doubts that these manipulations may raise in the public consciousness". The magazine said it hoped to find "at least the authors, and possibly the sponsors, of this propaganda".

*   Charlie Hebdo is a French weekly magazine of political satire. It publishes cartoons, reports, discussions and jokes of a nonconformist nature. It ridicules politicians, the far-right, Islam and Christianity.

Charlie Archive Collection

The 2015 terrorist attack against the staff of the French satirical magazine _Charlie Hebdo_ provoked a vigorous debate about fundamental political and ethical issues. This archive aims to document the events and ensuing debate.

Items left at the site of the Charlie Hebdo attack. [View Details.](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/via/8001252916/catalog)

Charlie Archive Collection

Issues that came to the fore following the attacks and are covered in this archive include freedom of expression; the relationship between state, religion and society; respect for other beliefs and perspectives; inequality; and the disenfranchisement of individuals and communities.

This archive, curated by Lidia Uziel, Head of Americas, Europe, and Oceania Division and build in collaboration with Harvard librarians, faculty members, and students, contains a wide array of materials and perspectives from individuals with a range of political positions and social backgrounds.

Though the events and later protests were concentrated in France, extensive media coverage drew global attention. _"__Je suis Charlie" (_"I am Charlie") or _"Je ne suis pas Charlie"_ ("I am not Charlie") became international expressions of adhesion to or distance from the stance attributed to _Charlie Hebdo_ on religion in general and to Islam in particular.

The goal of the archive is to document a moment in the early 21st century when the word “Charlie” took on tragic significance and became charged with conflicting emotions, opinions, and agendas.

Accessing These Materials
-------------------------

While much of the archive is available online, physical items are also available upon request for use in Widener Library's Phillips Reading Room.

Claves:

*   The disinformation campaign that claims that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has paid for celebrities to visit Ukraine has spread in at least nine languages
*   Maldita.es has analyzed more than 40 Twitter posts (now X) with this narrative that, in just three days, has more than 20 million views and only 14% have a note from the community denying it
*   Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have published this disinformation narrative since the first day it began to be distributed

  

* * *

The video claiming that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [has paid for visits by several prominent US officials to Ukraine](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 has gone viral with (fake) messages **in at least nine different languages** ​​(German, Spanish, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian). Its impact has thus crossed borders, reaching more than 20 million views [on Twitter (now X)](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230724/twitter-x-cambio-nombre-logo-elon-musk/)
 in just three days.

[📲 ¡Pincha aquí y sigue el canal de WhatsApp de Maldita.es  \
para que no te la cuelen!](https://bit.ly/3EGa2ju)

For this study, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has analysed [more than 40 posts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 (all of them with more than 5,000 views at 5pm on 7 February 2025) that spread this video with disinformation messages through X. These contents have been published over three days (between 5 and 7 February) and, together, they add up to millions of views on the platform. Even so, only 14.3% (that is, six out of 42) have [community notes](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
 warning users that it is disinformation content.

! <image:6457>

The narrative was also widely disseminated by channels and websites linked to or close to the Kremlin, both in Spain and in Russia and other countries between February 5 and 7.

**This disinformation narrative has 20 million views in three days and nine languages**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The narrative shared in X:** USAID has sponsored visits by American celebrities (such as Angelina Jolie, Ben Stiller, Orlando Bloom, Sean Penn, and Jean-Claude Van Damme) to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, in order to boost Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s popularity in the United States and better coordinate its funding programs. Much of the content provides as supposed “proof” a video with the logo of [E!News, a “celebrity and entertainment news” website in the United States](https://archive.ph/s1f93)
.

**The fact-check:** [The video circulating is not from E!News](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
. There is also [**no evidence**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 **of USAID's alleged payments to the celebrities it mentions.** Ben Stiller, the American actor and comedian who is the subject of the disinformation, has said that it is “completely false.”

Even so, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [has located up to 42 contents with more than 5,000 views](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 as of February 7 that spread this narrative on X. These have been published between February 5 and 7, 2025 and are shared in at least seven languages ​​in addition to Spanish: German, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian. Some [have several million views](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 and, together (and in just three days), they add up to more than 20 million views within this platform alone.

**Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have been publishing this disinformation narrative since February 5**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since February 5, social media channels linked to the Kremlin or that routinely share disinformation pushed by Russia have also been spreading the video accusing USAID of paying Hollywood stars to travel to Ukraine.

On February 5, the X account “Russia Informa,” which has almost 80,000 followers, [shared the video](https://archive.li/OMGEP)
 with claims such as “USAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Kyiv after the start of the special operation. The E!News portal published the details. Angelina Jolie cost the most: 20 million.” Also [the Telegram channel](https://archive.ph/NEJeQ)
 “Irinamar,” which claims to share content with a “Russian view of the special operation in Ukraine,” or “[Wars and Geopolitics](https://archive.ph/rTjNU)
”, among others, published a post that same day.

On February 6, it was shared **by the website Spanish News Pravda**, a website that is part of the Pravda ecosystem and that, according to the [Viginum agency](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/notre-organisation/composantes/service-de-vigilance-et-protection-contre-les-ingerences-numeriques)
, belonging to the General Secretariat of National Defense and Security of France, “one of its main objectives is to spread disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda in different EU languages”. In Spain, [Spanish News Pravda has published](https://maldita.es/index.php/malditobulo/20241106/comitiva-rey-paginas-rusas-arabe/)
 disinformation such as the hoax about Felipe VI’s motorcade in Valencia after the passage of the DANA [or the hoax that Coca-Cola had donated mobile morgues](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241203/morgue-mobile-cocacola-ucrania/)
 with its logo to Ukraine. On this occasion, Spanish News Pravda published it on two occasions ([1](https://archive.ph/bqahS)
 and [2](https://archive.li/PdxYX)
).

Liu Sivaya [also shared the E!News video](https://archive.li/2hpjN)
 on the 6th on her X account, where she has nearly 200,000 followers.

! <image:6464>

Between February 5 and 6, it was also actively disseminated “by Russian propaganda outlets, including Tsargrad, Russia Today, EurAsia Daily, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Military Review, and Vesti,” explain Georgian fact-checkers [Myth Detector, who have also verified the content](https://mythdetector.com/en/usaid-paid-actors/)
. They add that it was shared not only by Kremlin-controlled outlets, “but also by networks affiliated with the Georgian government, including the pro-government POSTV, several media channels, as well as individual accounts,” as they identify in the published article.

! <image:6465>

**Only six of the 42 disinformation contents have Community Notes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publication of this text, 85.7% of the contents analysed (i.e. 37 out of 42) **are circulating on X without** [**community notes**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
. Only in six of the more than 40 cases does the warning system of Elon Musk's platform indicate that they are disinformation content. These posts are written in Spanish (3), German (1), French (1) and English (1). None of the contents with more than 5,000 views that have been taken into account in this analysis in Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch or Romanian contain these messages.

! <image:6466>

Those cases in which the Community Notes have been applied do not reach 125.000 views in any single post. In fact, [the tweet with the most impact](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 that [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has found with this narrative (which has, as of the date of publication of this text, more than 15.8 million views) [**does not have a visible warning**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/ben-stiller-tuit-desinformador-nota-comunidad/)
**,** more than 36 hours after its publication. It is the first post in a thread in English that states that “USAID paid Ben Stiller 4 million dollars to take these photos with Zelensky.” This message is accompanied by two images (which are real) of the American actor and comedian with the president of Ukraine.

! <image:6467>

[Community Notes is the system implemented](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
 in X that allows users to add context to misleading tweets. [Although this is only selected and displayed when it is rated](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/#:~:text=en%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%3F-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20funcionan%20las%20Notas%20de%20la%20comunidad%3F,-Las%20Notas%20de)
 as useful by enough contributors with “different points of view.” In fact**,** [**there are actually notes proposed**](https://archive.is/QieM8)
 **in the tweet with more than 15.8 million views**, as mentioned above. And why are they not displayed? Due to a lack of consensus between contributors, who present “different points of view” according to the platform’s rules.

! <image:6468>

This is precisely one of the points to improve the X Community Notes system identified by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [in its analysis](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
. One of the problems it raises is that many of the notes that are proposed and that refute viral misinformation are never shown to users. It also points against the need for consensus among users, who tend to disagree. 

Thus, several contexts have been identified in which community notes have not been sufficient to combat hoaxes. For example, [during the disinformation campaign](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20241127/dana-notas-comunidad-x-twitter/)

**61.9% of posts are from users with a blue tick, but that does not mean they are trustworthy**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common factor detected in this analysis is that most of the accounts that have shared the narrative about USAID allegedly paying US celebrities to visit Ukraine in X **pay the premium version**. Of the 42 pieces of content analysed, **37 were published by users with the so-called** [**blue tick**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230421/Twitter-tic-azul-original-cambios/)
 (61.9% of the total). In fact, among the ten most viral tweets, there is only one tweet that does not have the blue tick.

[Why you can trust Sky News](/info/policies-and-standards)

Hollywood star Ben Stiller has met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling the actor-turned-leader: "You are my hero."

The US actor, 56, who has been meeting with refugees in **[Poland](https://news.sky.com/topic/poland-6132)
** and **[Ukraine](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
** since 18 June, shook hands with the wartime premier as they met in Kyiv.

**[UK would be 'right to prepare for war' - Ukraine war latest updates](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-war-russia-putin-eu-membership-12541713)
**

He told President Zelenskyy: "It's great honour for me. You are my hero. You quit a great acting career for this."

"Not so great as you," he replied.

But Stiller insisted: "What you have done, the way you rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."

The actor spoke of his time visiting the war-torn country, and the devastation he had seen.

"I feel that it's hard to understand what's going on here if you haven't been here.

"We were talking about the actual impact of coming here. I just was in Irpin this morning, saw the level of destruction.

"You see it on TV, you see it on social media, it's something else to actually see it and feel it and then to talk to people. We have talked to a bunch of people."

**.

The pair discussed the difficulties keeping the war in Ukraine in the global public eye after so many months of fighting.

President Zelenskyy said: "It is not interesting to speak about the war every day for an audience, for different people, but for us it is very important.

"When people forget to speak about this influence and how to push Russia, it's very difficult."

Looking at Stiller, he added: "Thanks to people like you, we can do it."

**

As he visited eastern Europe, Stiller has released a video message urging global support for Ukrainian refugees and the 100 million refugees around the world.

In his message he said: "I'm here meeting people who've been impacted by the work and hearing how it's changed their lives.

"War and violence are devastating people all over the world. No one chooses to flee their home. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person."

Last week Stiller, who is a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) goodwill ambassador, had flown to Rzeszow in southeastern Poland.

On Sunday he was also spotted walking in the western city of Lviv, which has come under attack by [**Russian**](https://news.sky.com/topic/russia-5803)
 forces during the months-long invasion but has remained relatively unscathed compared to the ferocious assaults in the east of the country.

On his Instagram page, Stiller said he was meeting families "whose lives have been torn apart by war and violence in [**Ukraine**](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
".

He said millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 90% being women and children, following the invasion by President Vladimir Putin's troops.

Stiller added: "I'm here to learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify calls for solidarity.

"Everyone has the right to seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever."

In one image, he was photographed meeting workers from the UNHCR.

In another post, the Zoolander and Tropic Thunder star was pictured hugging two refugee children near the Medyka border in Poland.

Since the war began, a number of stars from the music and film industries have visited Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.

In April, Hollywood actress and UN humanitarian Angelina Jolie [**made a surprise visit to Lviv**](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-angelina-jolie-seen-in-lviv-amid-russias-invasion-12602639)

### Watch on Deadline

POTUS today said that is “not likely” he will go to Ukraine while in Europe later this week.

Speaking with reporters briefly on a wide range of topics this morning, Biden added that he did not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by swooping into Kyiv as other leaders and celebrities have over the past months. Still, having visited with Ukrainian refugees on a trip to Poland in March, Biden could be planning a surprise touch down in Kyiv as he travels in Germany and Spain in the coming days.

! <image:6481>

On the other hand, before meeting Zelenskyy on Monday, Stiller walked among the ruins of Irpin and talked to survivors of the Russian attacks. “It’s one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,” said the actor to Zelenskyy later in the duo’s sit-down. “That’s a lot more shocking.”

“What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,” the battle garbed Ukrainian leader told Stiller. “But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east.”

Earlier, Stiller filmed a brief video for social media unveiling his trip, as you can see below:

The video from February 5 claims that USAID paid **Angelina Jolie** $20 million, **Sean Penn** $5 million, **Jean-Claude Van Damme** (misspelled in the footage) $1.5 million, **Orlando Bloom** $8 million, and **Ben Stiller** $4 million to complete their respective visits to Ukraine.

Nearly three years after **Ben Stiller** [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axbhf1Qhe94)
 Ukrainian president **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** “my hero” during a humanitarian trip to his country, the actor is refuting claims that his travels were funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

“Totally false. News watermark, claims that USAID paid various actors to visit Ukraine and has racked up millions of views since being posted on Wednesday, February 5.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is from their meeting on June 20, 2022, as reported by Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878)) and Deadline ([https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/](https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/)). The image is used in a disinformation campaign claiming that Stiller was paid by USAID, which is denied by Stiller, according to Maldita.es ([https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/)).

The Maldita.es article discusses the disinformation campaign and the lack of evidence for USAID payments to celebrities. The Sky News article reports on Stiller's visit to Kyiv and his meeting with Zelenskyy. The Deadline article also covers the meeting, but does not mention Stiller receiving money from USAID. <image:17>, <image:6456>, <image:6457>, <image:6464>, <image:6465>, <image:6466>, <image:6467>, <image:6468>, <image:6469>, <image:6472>, <image:6474>, <image:6475>, <image:6477>, <image:6481>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351)) and the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/](https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/)) reported that Ben Stiller met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 20, 2022, in Kyiv. Stiller was visiting as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. The ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989)) also reported on the meeting.

The BBC source includes the image of the meeting (<image:17>). The ABC News and the New York Post sources do not mention Stiller receiving $4 million from USAID.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is from their meeting on June 20, 2022, as reported by Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878)) and Deadline ([https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/](https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/)).

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

In a wide-ranging conversation on [Theo Von's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

**Transcript:**

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia. So this particular narrative, what it alleges is that mansions of eight Ukrainian generals were amongst the homes destroyed."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/)) reported that the claim originated on a Russian Telegram channel and mentioned Valerii Zaluzhnyi as one of the individuals named in the claims. There is zero evidence to support this claim. <image:2335> <image:2342>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the claim originated from pro-Kremlin social media accounts and was debunked by fact-checkers. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation labeled it as "Russian propaganda." Forbes reported that the claim originated on a Russian Telegram channel and that there is zero evidence to support it.


## Final Judgement
The claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires is demonstrably false. Multiple reliable sources, including NPR, Houston Public Media, and Forbes, have debunked the claim, identifying it as Russian propaganda and stating there is no evidence to support it.

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine
================================================================

21 July 2023

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday."

Since the Independence of [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")
 following the collapse of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

After the start of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")
, when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)
 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. The FBI memorialized Smirnov's lies in an [FD-1023 form](/wiki/List_of_FBI_forms#FD-1023 "List of FBI forms")
, which read in part:

> Zlochevsky said he had a total of "17 recordings" involving the Bidens; two of the recordings included Joe Biden, and the remaining 15 recordings only included Hunter Biden. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)
> [\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."[\[35\]](#cite_note-Whitehurst_Mascaro_2/15/2024-35)

The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled [House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family](/wiki/United_States_House_Oversight_Committee_investigation_into_the_Biden_family "United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family")
 in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services"."

Prosecutors and the defence have agreed to recommend a sentence of between four and six years in prison when he is sentenced next month.

Smirnov, 44, was [arrested in February](/news/2024/2/16/fbi-informant-charged-with-lying-in-bidens-ukraine-bribe-claims)
 on charges of making a “false statement” and “creating a false and fictitious record” to his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter Biden $5m each around 2015.

Smirnov made the politically charged allegations in June 2020, after “expressing bias” about Joe Biden when he was running for president, prosecutors said.

In fact, Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017, according to court documents.

The FBI found no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes as US president or in his previous office as vice president.

While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment, his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House impeachment inquiry into Biden.

Before Smirnov’s arrest, Republicans had demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were true.

During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also claimed the Russians probably had recordings of [Hunter Biden](/news/2023/6/30/hunter-biden-the-us-presidents-scandal-plagued-son)
 because a hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was “wired” and under their control — information he said was passed along to him by four high-level Russian officials.

But Hunter Biden had never travelled to Ukraine, according to Smirnov’s indictment.

Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that “officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story” about Hunter Biden.

“Despite repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information to the FBI and that he must not fabricate evidence, the defendant provided false derogatory information” about the Bidens, prosecutors said in the indictment filed in federal court.

Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial in a gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in a separate tax case. But he was [pardoned this month](/news/2024/12/2/joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters)
 by his father, who said he believed “raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.”

The BBC News article from July 21, 2023, discusses an FBI document detailing allegations that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm, but there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. The article is available at [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217). The Wikipedia article discusses the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden took a bribe, but a joint investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. The article is available at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory).

Al Jazeera published an article on December 16, 2024, stating that a former FBI informant pleaded guilty to lying about a bribery scheme involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The FBI found no evidence of corruption or bribes. The article is available at [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/16/former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-phony-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/16/former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-phony-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens). <image:1>, <image:10075>, <image:10077>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that investigations into alleged bribery schemes involving Joe Biden and Ukraine have found no evidence of wrongdoing. Specifically, the BBC News and Al Jazeera articles state that investigations by the FBI found no evidence to support claims of bribes. The Wikipedia article also mentions the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, but it also states that no evidence of wrongdoing was found.

The claim that the image shows an authentic list released by Ukraine detailing bribes is not supported by the evidence. The search results focus on investigations and conspiracy theories, but they do not mention any official list released by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

_Руслан_ (Ruslan), a character in [Alexander Pushkin](/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin "Alexander Pushkin")
's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Full form | Short form | Diminutive form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Cyrillic/Latin) |     |     |

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

letters of the Russian alphabet 

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

To fill in the positions of the characters on the bottom line of a machine-readable record, a digital method of encoding information is used, except for the positions of characters 11 – 13 and 21.

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

![Russia passport number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20318'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

 and would remain unchanged.[\[215\]](#cite_note-219)

Arthur Novosiltsev / Moskva News Agency

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia, with surging government spending on the war continuing to provide a powerful economic stimulus for the country.

The IMF also slashed its outlook for Ukraine, whose economy and infrastructure have been battered by two and a half years of conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine are spending huge sums to continue fighting in the war, with Moscow's state expenditures having helped the economy grow strongly despite a barrage of Western sanctions.

According to its latest forecast, the IMF said it expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 3.2%. But it also cut its prediction for next year's growth from 1.5% to 1.3% amid signs of mounting economic problems.

Russia's Central Bank has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the government's military spending, saying the economy has been “overheating” for months. High inflation — 8.6% in September — and intense labor shortages are also posing economic headaches for Moscow.

In a rare move, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged earlier this month that Russia's record low unemployment of 2.4% was a “limiting factor” for the country's growth prospects.

Russia's Central Bank has raised interest rates to 19% in a bid to bring inflation under control, and it could increase them again at a meeting this coming Friday.

Russia's Finance Ministry, meanwhile, proposed raising military spending next year by almost 30% to around $145 billion, with combined defense and security spending set to account for approximately 40% of state expenditures.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (<image:4533>). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF raised its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (<image:4535>). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed global growth. The IMF also raised its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, I need information from the World Economic Outlook or other IMF publications from October 2024 that rank the world's largest economies.

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. The IMF’s latest [World Economic Outlook](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2025/update/january/english/text.ashx "(opens in a new window)")
 foresees Russia’s economic growth slowing down to 1.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, but it is still expected to grow. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)

.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)

 on Jan. With more than 20% of manufacturing companies paying interest costs exceeding two-thirds of their pre-tax profits at the end of 2024, compared to just 10% a year earlier, Russia should brace for a further “large-scale jump in corporate bankruptcies,” according to a report prepared by Russia’s pro-government [Center For Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting](http://www.forecast.ru/_ARCHIVE/Analitics/DB/2025_01_21eco.pdf)

The evidence indicates that the IMF ranked Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This information comes from a source discussing Russia's economy.

The claim is therefore partially verified. The IMF did rank Russia as the fourth-largest economy, but the evidence does not specify the exact month when this ranking was published.

 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана.

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

![Зеленым цветом обозначены освобожденные территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20703'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)
 soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, German tanks with German crews were captured, a NATO biolab was found under Mariupol, all with no evidence," Cusumano told _Newsweek_.

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Some NATO troops will also attend Friday's commemoration of the defeat of the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw.

A large military parade will take place in Warsaw on Friday to commemorate Poland's victory there against the Red Army in 1920.

The celebrations will be attended by nearly 4,000 Polish soldiers as well as almost 200 army representatives from allied countries including the US and the UK.

The events to mark Polish Army Day will include a wreath-laying ceremony led by Poland's President Karol Nawrocki and his wife Marta.

For the first time, a naval parade in the Baltic Sea will also be held, with 20 ships as well as hydrographic and rescue vessels appearing in the waters around Hel.

**Great show of force in Warsaw and on the Baltic**
---------------------------------------------------

The main highlight of the celebrations, however, will be the military parade on Warsaw's Wisłostrada, which will begin at midday.

"We will be showing the most modern equipment at the disposal of the Polish Armed Forces," spokesperson for the General Staff of the Polish Army Colonel Joanna Klejszmit told Euronews.

Tanks as well as lighter vehicles will be used in the procession, she added.

F-16 aircraft and AH-64 Apache helicopters will also be on display, as will Himars rocket launchers, according to Poland's defence ministry.

The airshow will feature the Australian Army's E-7A Wedgetail early-warning aircraft.

"We will be joined for the first time ever by soldiers from Australia. They are stationed in Poland with their early reconnaissance aircraft, so there will really be something to see," said Colonel Klejszmit.

During the dress rehearsal, Deputy Prime Minister Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasised the special role of France, recalling that the support of French commanders was crucial to the Polish victory at the Battle of Warsaw.

"This is special, because the Battle of Warsaw also with the participation of French troops, the support of French generals, commanders, could have been victorious, so we will thank our allies as well," Kosiniak-Kamysz explained.

The two events — the parade and the naval parade — will start at the same time and will be broadcast live.

In an interview with Euronews, Lieutenant Colonel Michał Tomczyk said interest in the military is growing year on year, especially given the current security concerns in Europe over Russia's all-out war in Ukraine.

He noted that 15 August is the time when many people express their desire to join the army.

"In fact, every garrison in Poland organises its Polish Army Day. There, there will be an opportunity to talk to military personnel and ask about recruitment or particular training courses," he said.

On Saturday, the celebrations will continue with the ceremonial opening of the Museum of the Battle of Warsaw 1920 in Ossów.

Poland currently spends over 4% of its GDP on defence and, with 216,100 military personnel, has the third largest army in NATO.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO member Poland paid tribute Thursday to its historic 1920 victory over the Red Army by honoring fallen Poles and showing off modern tanks and other equipment that it hopes will deter [the threat it sees in modern-day Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-self-defense-security-ukraine-russia-war-06569fdb6f4792fd0b919a24e1d6bef1)
.

More than 2,500 Polish troops, joined by dozens of U.S. Since Poland broke free of Moscow’s control starting in 1989 and then joined NATO, it has worked to modernize its army.

Those efforts moved into higher gear after Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, first invaded parts of Ukraine in 2014, and then began its full-fledged assault in 2022, with fears heightened all along the strategic stretch of NATO’s eastern flank — from the Baltic nations to Poland to Romania.
