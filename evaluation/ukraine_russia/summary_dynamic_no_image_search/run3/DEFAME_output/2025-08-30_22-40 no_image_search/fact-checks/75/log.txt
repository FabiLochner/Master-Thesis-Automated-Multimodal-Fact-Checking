Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755): 
Content: The Anadolu Agency published an article on August 20, 2024, stating that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. <image:i>. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that US mercenaries were fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The article mentions an incursion into the Kursk region that began on the night of August 5-6.

The claim '<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from September 2022 and shows Ukrainian soldiers in the Kharkiv region, not American mercenaries in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as reported by Apostrophe.ua, Charter97.org, and Cripo.com.ua. While Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during the incursion in August 2024, the U.S. denied it, as reported by Newsweek.

So, the overall veracity is: false
