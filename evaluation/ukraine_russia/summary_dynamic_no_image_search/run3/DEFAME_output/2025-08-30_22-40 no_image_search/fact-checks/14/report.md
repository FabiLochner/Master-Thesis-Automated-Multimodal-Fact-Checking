### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources debunk a claim that a Fox News article stated that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. Gwara Media states that the article is fake and that the author did not publish any articles mentioning the Ukrainian psychological and information operation center on that date. The DW article fact-checks a manipulated Fox News screenshot and states that the screenshot is fake. The Wikipedia article provides information about the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine. ![image 11](media/14.jpg)
