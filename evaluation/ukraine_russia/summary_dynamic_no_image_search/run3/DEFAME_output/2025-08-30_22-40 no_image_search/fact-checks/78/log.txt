Useful result: From [Source](https://defensescoop.com/2025/04/03/ukraine-russian-tanks-destroyed-attack-drones-cavoli/):

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/pictures-ukraines-surprise-advance-into-russia-2024-08-23/): 
Content: Reuters published on August 23, 2024, a photo collection titled "In pictures: Ukraine's surprise advance into Russia". The collection includes images of Ukrainian forces in the Sumy and Kursk regions of Russia, including images of explosions, destroyed bridges, and Ukrainian soldiers. <image:10194>, <image:10195>.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While evidence confirms a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and tank losses, the provided evidence does not explicitly link the image of destroyed tanks to the Kursk incursion or confirm that the tanks are Ukrainian.

So, the overall veracity is: false
