### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's presidential fleet caught fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow (![image 5183](media/2025-08-29_09-54-1756461243-146507.jpg)), as reported in [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-putin-limousine-fire-video-2052846). The Hindustan Times reported on a viral video of an explosion involving an Aurus Senat limousine in Moscow, near the FSB headquarters, mentioning speculation of an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, but it was not immediately clear who was in the car and no injuries were reported, as reported in [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/275000-aurus-senat-limousine-vladimir-putin-goes-up-in-flames-limo-explodes-moscow-assassination-attempt-101743297137628.html).

The Economic Times reported that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow, raising security concerns (![image 5206](media/2025-08-29_09-55-1756461313-876345.jpg), ![image 5207](media/2025-08-29_09-55-1756461314-438976.jpg), ![image 5208](media/2025-08-29_09-55-1756461315-424860.jpg)), as reported in [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms). The Sun reported that the explosion happened amid rumors surrounding Putinâ€™s health.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow. However, the reports do not confirm that Putin was in the car at the time of the explosion, nor do they confirm his death.

The Hindustan Times mentions speculation of an assassination attempt, but it was not immediately clear who was in the car and no injuries were reported. The Economic Times also raises security concerns.

Therefore, the claim that Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines is not supported by the evidence. The evidence only confirms an explosion involving one of his limousines.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines exploded in Moscow, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in the explosion. The reports do not confirm that Putin was in the car at the time of the explosion.

The most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While reports from sources like [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-putin-limousine-fire-video-2052846), [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/275000-aurus-senat-limousine-vladimir-putin-goes-up-in-flames-limo-explodes-moscow-assassination-attempt-101743297137628.html), and [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms) confirm an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in the explosion. The reports do not confirm that Putin was in the car at the time of the explosion.
