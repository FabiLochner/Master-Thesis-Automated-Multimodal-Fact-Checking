## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Donald Trump criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Truth Social for suggesting the end of the Russia-Ukraine war is "very, very far away" (![image 1567](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592628-069882.jpg)). The article is authored by Aamer Madhani of the Associated Press.

NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, discussing a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office (![image 1572](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592644-705128.jpg), ![image 1569](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592639-153450.jpg), ![image 1570](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592640-602508.jpg)). Reuters published an article on February 19, 2025, reporting on the strained relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy (![image 1573](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592657-229427.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about Volodymyr Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine. The provided articles discuss Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy on Truth Social and their strained relationship, but they do not mention any actions taken by Zelenskyy to block the platform.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.


## Final Judgement
The search results reveal articles discussing interactions between Trump and Zelenskyy, including Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy on Truth Social. However, there is no mention of Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

The claim is not supported by the provided evidence, as there is no information about Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social. Therefore, the most appropriate decision is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results reveal that Donald Trump criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Truth Social, and there were strained relations between the two leaders in February 2025, as reported by sources like PBS News and NPR. However, the search results do not contain any information about Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine.
