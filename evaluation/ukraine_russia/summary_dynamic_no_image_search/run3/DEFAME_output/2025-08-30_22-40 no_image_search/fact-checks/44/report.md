## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
France 24 ([Source](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118)) reported on President Biden's response to Hurricane Helene, including his visit to North Carolina and his refutation of claims about the government's response. The article mentions the death toll reached 130 and that Trump accused Biden of "sleeping" <image:k>. The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o)) discussed misinformation about the government's response to Hurricane Helene ![image 9985](media/2025-08-30_22-48-1756594101-356650.jpg), ![image 9984](media/2025-08-30_22-48-1756594101-088227.jpg), ![image 9990](media/2025-08-30_22-48-1756594103-442041.jpg), ![image 9995](media/2025-08-30_22-48-1756594104-668750.jpg). The article mentions that Trump and his allies claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants. The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-recover-biden-visit-823be75adbed4fa1d7c108a207dbb3e3)) reported that on September 29, President Joe Biden said he will visit areas impacted by Hurricane Helene.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about President Biden announcing a halt to aid for Hurricane Helene-affected areas or allocating $2.4 billion to Ukraine. The evidence focuses on Biden's response to the hurricane, including his visit to affected areas and refuting misinformation.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/biden-urges-congress-helene-relief-funds)) reported on the White House's response to misinformation regarding Hurricane Helene relief efforts, including Biden urging Congress to pass a disaster-relief package. Le Monde ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html)) reported that on September 30, 2024, Biden delivered remarks on the response to Hurricane Helene at the White House ![image 10022](media/2025-08-30_22-50-1756594253-730648.jpg) and announced he would travel to North Carolina.


## Elaboration
The new evidence still does not support the claim. The Guardian article focuses on Biden urging Congress for disaster relief funds, and Le Monde reports on Biden's remarks about the hurricane response and his travel plans. Neither source mentions Biden halting aid to hurricane-affected areas or allocating funds to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that President Biden addressed Hurricane Helene and its impact, including visiting affected areas and urging for disaster relief funds. However, there is no evidence in the provided sources to support the claim that Biden announced a halt to aid for the hurricane-affected areas or allocated $2.4 billion to Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that President Biden announced a halt to aid for areas affected by Hurricane Helene and allocated $2.4 billion to Ukraine. News reports from sources like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o), [France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/biden-urges-congress-helene-relief-funds), and [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html) focused on Biden's response to the hurricane, including his visit to affected areas and calls for disaster relief, but did not mention the actions described in the claim.
