## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Economic Forum published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address at the Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, from January 15â€“19, 2024, which included an image of Zelenskyy at the World Economic Forum (![image 10](media/13.jpg)). Zelenskyy called on business leaders to invest in Ukraine.

Yahoo News states that the photo of Zelenskyy and Schwab in suits was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits in public (![image 1763](media/2025-08-07_19-06-1754593598-169511.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. However, the evidence indicates that the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits in public. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. However, the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits in public.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
