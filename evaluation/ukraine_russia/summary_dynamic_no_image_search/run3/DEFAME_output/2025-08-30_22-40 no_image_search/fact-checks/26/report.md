## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "[2025 Trumpâ€“Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)" describes a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, 2025, and mentions the Trump administration aligning with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025. <image:i>

NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about an abrupt end to a White House visit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump after an "Oval Office spat". ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg) Al Jazeera published an article on February 28, 2025, about a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, describing it as a "shouting match". <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k> The article does not contain the quote in the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy took place at the White House in February 2025 and that it was contentious. However, the provided articles from Wikipedia, NPR, and Al Jazeera do not contain the quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not support the specific quote.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a reliable source that quotes Zelenskyy making the statement.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February 2025, which was reportedly contentious. However, none of the provided sources contain the quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in February 2025 is confirmed by sources like the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting), an NPR article, and an Al Jazeera article, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy is not found in any of the provided sources.
