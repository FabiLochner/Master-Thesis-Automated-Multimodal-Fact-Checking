Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on February 28, 2025, about a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The meeting was described as a "shouting match" where Trump told Zelenskyy to be "thankful" for US support. Trump also released a statement on social media, seemingly withdrawing the US from negotiations with Ukraine. The article does not contain the quote in the claim.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in February 2025 is confirmed by sources like the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting), an NPR article, and an Al Jazeera article, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy is not found in any of the provided sources.

So, the overall veracity is: false
