Content: The search result from Deadline Film + TV, published on February 6, 2025, states that Ben Stiller debunked a claim that he received $4 million from USAID for his trip to Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-totally-false-actor-ben-stiller-debunks-claims-usaid-funded-ukraine-trip-231285317684): 
Content: MSNBC's "Morning Joe" reports that Ben Stiller debunked claims that his trip to Ukraine was funded by USAID. <image:17>

The claim '<image:17> This image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, for which Stiller received $4 million from USAID.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image accurately depicts Ben Stiller's meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 20, 2022, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for the trip is demonstrably false. Stiller denied receiving any payment, and the UNHCR confirmed that he self-funds his humanitarian work, as reported by [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb).
