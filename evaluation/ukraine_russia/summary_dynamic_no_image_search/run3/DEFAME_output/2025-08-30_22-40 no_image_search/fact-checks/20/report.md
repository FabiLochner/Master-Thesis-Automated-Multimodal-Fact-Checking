## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Mark Rutte and Donald Trump met after Trump won the US presidential election in 2024. The discussions involved Ukraine, with Trump considering providing weapons and potentially authorizing funding. However, the provided evidence does not contain any statement from Mark Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.
