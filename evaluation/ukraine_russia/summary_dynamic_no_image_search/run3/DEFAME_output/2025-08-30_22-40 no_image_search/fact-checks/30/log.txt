The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that while peace negotiations were underway in 2025, a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. Articles from August 2025, such as those from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks)) and CNN, discuss ongoing negotiations and the distinction between a ceasefire and a peace deal. Additionally, the Institute for the Study of War's assessment ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025)) from August 24, 2025, indicates that the war was still ongoing.

So, the overall veracity is: false
