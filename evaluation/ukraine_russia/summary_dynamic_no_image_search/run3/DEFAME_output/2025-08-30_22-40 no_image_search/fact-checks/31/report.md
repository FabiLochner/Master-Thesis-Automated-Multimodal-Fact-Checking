## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, Ukraine passed a law, informally known as the "Law on the Prohibition of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine," banning religious organizations with ties to the Russian Orthodox Church. The law was passed on August 20, 2024, and entered into force on September 23, 2024, making it impossible for religious organizations under the control of an aggressor state to operate. The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations supported the legislative initiative on August 17, 2024.

The law could effectively ban congregations of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, raising concerns about religious freedom and human rights from organizations like Human Rights Watch (<image:k>), the UN, and Pope Francis. The European Parliament also discussed the ban on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate at the end of August 2024.
