## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 12, 2025, after a phone call with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump stated that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would begin immediately, according to a CNN article (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). Reuters reported that Trump said both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace, and he ordered U.S. officials to begin talks to end the war (![image 9658](media/2025-08-30_22-25-1756592700-214951.jpg)).

Wikipedia discusses the phone call and a subsequent meeting where Trump agreed to begin peace talks, with support from various European countries. The sources also mention a potential meeting between Trump and Putin in Saudi Arabia.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that after the phone call on February 12, 2025, Donald Trump announced that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would begin immediately. Reuters reported that Trump said both Putin and Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace, and he ordered U.S. officials to begin talks to end the war. The CNN article also supports this.

The evidence does not state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war. Instead, he announced the beginning of negotiations.


## Final Judgement
After a call with Putin on February 12, 2025, Donald Trump announced that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would begin immediately, not that he had reached an agreement to end the war. Multiple sources confirm this.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Following a phone call with Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, Donald Trump announced the commencement of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, as reported by sources such as CNN and Reuters ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call), [https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). However, the evidence does not support the claim that an agreement to end the war was reached at that time.
