This [front cover](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 on X (formerly Twitter) with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, purportedly published by _The Economist,_ is ALTERED.

The post accompanying the magazine cover reads, “APOCALYPSE: Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the start of World War III,” warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.”

The same claim has been posted [here](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 and [here](https://archive.is/x6qkC)
.

However, did _The Economist_ publish the front cover? PesaCheck investigated.

_The Economist_ [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 shows no November 2024 covers similar to the one under investigation.

In November, the outlet published two front pages featuring Donald Trump, but none had a photo of Russian President Putin or the headline “Apocalypse.”

Zoom image will be displayed

The alleged front cover circulating online has stories similar to those in [an edition published](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-16)
 by _The Economist._ However, it was altered to include photos of Trump and Putin.

The [original front cover](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Di8B4QNPs/)
 has stories from _The Economist’s_ 16 March 2024 edition.

_The altered cover (left) vs the original cover_

Additionally, the fake cover does not display a publication date, whereas authentic covers always indicate when the issue was released, as shown on the [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
.

PesaCheck has looked into this front cover on X with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin purportedly published by _The Economist_ and finds that it was ALTERED.

Hijacked news stories appear in different forms, from basic images to complete websites or social media profiles

Advertisement

Shortly after [Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 won his second term as US president last November, an image of the front cover of _The Economist_ magazine was [shared online](https://archive.ph/nZAM2 "External link — shared online")
 with captions in several languages.

The banner headline read "Apocalypse," and was accompanied by an image of Trump facing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](/en/vladimir-putin/t-17449200)
 with a series of long-range missiles in the background.

Some of the comments linked to the cover feared the start of World War III and speculated about the use of [nuclear weapons](/en/nuclear-weapons/t-63414896)
. 

However, this front cover never really existed, and _The Economist_ did not publish such a story. The alleged cover also cannot be found in [the magazine's archive](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive?year=2024 "External link — the magazine's archive")
.

It is a [disinformation tactic](/en/fake-news/t-37038790)
 known as "media spoofing." More and more reputable media outlets around the world are seeing their logos, websites, social media profiles and their look-and-feel hijacked to spread false or misleading narratives. 

This disinformation strategy isn't new but it seems to be growing in several regions of the world, as we can see by the sheer list of recent examples.

One such case is [this screenshot](https://archive.ph/NwIMQ "External link — this screenshot")
 of a false CNN article about [Elon Musk's](/en/elon-musk/t-63587027)
 satellite system Starlink carrying out blackouts in Ukraine after the contentious White House visit by President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 in late February.

Or this [cloned website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230913125635/https:/www.spiegel.ltd/ausland/Sanktionen-gegen-Russland-ruinieren-die-deutsche-Wirtschaft-a-36cbce42-524f-4945-8503-15182c908a97.html "External link — cloned website")
 of German magazine _Der Spiegel_ with the headline "Sanctions against Russia are ruining the German economy."

Or [this website](https://archive.ph/SJvY7 "External link — this website")
, resembling that of French daily _Le Parisien_, saying illegal migrants were a threat to the [2024 Paris Olympics](/en/olympics/t-17351918)
. 

Then there's also [this story](https://archive.ph/j95Jj "External link — this story")
, with the logo of the entertainment site E! News, which said USAID had sponsored celebrity trips to Ukraine. DW's Fact Check department debunked the claim [here](/en/fact-check-trumps-team-targets-usaid-with-false-claims/a-71535712)
, which was reposted by X owner Elon Musk to his 220 million followers and by Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. 

However, this is not only a problem in the United States and Europe. Media outlets around the world, from Israel's [_Haaretz_](https://archive.ph/yBmkw "External link — Haaretz")
 to Nicaragua's [_La Prensa_](https://www.laprensani.com/2025/03/19/nacionales/3449647-circula-noticia-falsa-que-utiliza-la-identidad-de-la-prensa "External link — La Prensa")
, have seen their identity hijacked.

La Prensa newspaper in Nicaragua recently revealed its identity had been cloned, and asked readers to carefully check contentImage: laprensani.com

In addition, academics in Nigeria [studied](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382295421_Between_Trust_and_Misinformation_A_Study_of_User_Engagement_with_Cloned_Pages_of_Daily_Trust_and_Vanguard_Newspapers_on_Facebook "External link — studied")
 several cloned social media profiles, especially on Facebook, of two English-language newspapers, _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_. 

So, what's behind this disinformation problem and what impact does it have?

And most importantly, how can you determine whether the news you're consuming comes from a real source? [DW Fact Check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 has some tips. 

From simple photo manipulation to sophisticated media spoofing 
---------------------------------------------------------------

All these examples show that fabricated news reports can appear in different forms: from very basic images that are edited to distort a text or include a media logo, to complete websites or social media profiles that pretend to be a well-known media organization — so-called "media spoofing."

Some of the fakes also use [artificial intelligence](/en/artificial-intelligence/t-42133476)
 tools. And in most cases, they tend to spread faster during breaking news events like elections, wars, natural disasters or economic crises. 

According to NewsGuard, a misinformation and media watchdog in the US, 40 reliable media organizations have been affected by such impersonations since 2018. And the problem is becoming "more widespread with each passing year."

Most of the instances [found by the watchdog](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/bad-actors-fake-being-real-news-outlets "External link — found by the watchdog")
 are linked to Russian influence operations that spread anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western narratives.

One such operation is called the "Doppelgänger campaign" and began after [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
. In [Germany](/en/russian-disinformation-is-growing-in-germany/a-70506294)
, the Foreign Ministry published a [technical report](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/resource/blob/2682484/2da31936d1cbeb9faec49df74d8bbe2e/technischer-bericht-desinformationskampagne-doppelgaenger-1--data.pdf "External link — technical report")
 last June detailing how the country has been affected by this Russian operation, which included "dozens of forged clones of mainstream media websites." 

German authorities found 'dozens of forged clones of mainstream media websites,' like this fake site of Der Spiegel magazine

McKenzie Sadeghi, who authored NewsGuard's analysis, told DW that this kind of disinformation usually follows a similar pattern: the claims are posted en masse by low-profile accounts on platforms like [Telegram](/en/telegram/t-60588751)
. Some are then picked up by higher-profile individuals, knowingly or unknowingly. 

"The fake continues to gain traction and eventually makes its way into Russian state media, which cites the high-profile figures on social media who share the claim rather than the original Telegram source, completely hiding its actual origins," she said.

Fakes undermining quality of online journalism 
-----------------------------------------------

According to NewsGuard, the media outlets most affected by imitations are BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, investigative journalism group Bellingcat, Fox News, _The Wall Street Journal_ and _USA Today_. [DW has also been a target in recent years](/en/fact-check-fake-news-and-content-targets-international-media/a-62381229)
.

But the pattern, topics and actors are not always the same, as there are clear regional variations.

In Nigeria, cloned pages of _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_ have spread rumors about issues like the [COVID-19 pandemic](/en/covid-19/t-62123668)
, the Boko Haram insurgency or oil prices — topics that have been relevant in the local political debate. 

"Cloned media websites are a huge problem, with potential to undermine the credibility and quality of online journalism, public opinion, the democratic process and social cohesion," Abubakar Tijjani Ibrahim, co-author of the _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_ study and lecturer at Kano State Polytechnic in Nigeria, told DW. 

He added that since cloned media sites lack professional ethics and safeguards, "the handlers of the pages tend to sensationalize, presenting issues in the most provocative way."

The URL of this fake website ended in '.top', while the official URL of Le Parisien ends in '.fr.'

What can you do to verify the content? 
---------------------------------------

Check the authenticity of a piece of information by combining critical observation and analysis with the use of tools that can provide valuable (but not infallible) hints. 

A first suggestion is to look for spelling or grammar mistakes, as well as for uneven spacing or blurry text.

If you have doubts, you can open a separate browser window, go to a search engine and actively look for the real news website. You can then contrast the look and feel of both items. Does anything look odd?

While you're on the real site, you can also carry out a keyword search of the alleged piece of information to see if it appears there. And you can check on other media outlets as well. Cross-checking is always key. If something seems off, then there's a likelihood that the story has been made up.

In the case of a screenshot, you can do a reverse image search, using Google Images or Tin Eye, for example. This could offer guidance as to whether the image was used before and whether the story has already been debunked and fact-checked.

A reverse image search of the Economist "Apocalypse" cover revealed several fact checks that disproved the cover's authenticity.

A reverse image search of a dubious front cover can reveal whether the story has been fact-checkedImage: Google

Regarding media outlets' cloned social media profiles, Ibrahim suggests checking whether the profiles provide links to the official news organization's contact details. One of the clones he analyzed on Facebook offered a Gmail account as a contact option. 

For cloned news websites, a further red flag is the URL or web address. A Google search would normally provide the correct website address. A look at the cloned site could reveal variations.

Remember the fake _Le Parisien_ website mentioned above? There, the URL ended in '.top', while the official URL ends in '.fr.' The same happened with the _Der Spiegel_ website: the official site is www.spiegel.de; the fake one was www.spiegel.ltd.

Sadeghi, of NewsGuard, said a further step could be to check the domain registration records, for instance on the [Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en/offers/whois-b?isc=sem3year&countryview=1&currencyType=EUR&swp_countrycode=DE&cdtl=c_17641286579.g_138121387813.k_kwd-400731202983.a_706593660658.d_c.ctv_g&bnb=b&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwnPS-BhBxEiwAZjMF0tmyXBYuRwTpiUn-erjMOExRdG5eoXShIAGVEhr1taMZGvGfAAIg6RoCtM8QAvD_BwE "External link — Go Daddy")
 platform or on [Who.is](https://who.is/ "External link — Who.is")
.

"There was a fake article on Spiegel.ltd," she explained. "The domain registration records, which are free, and you can look up, showed that it was anonymously registered in June 2022, while the actual domain for the outlet was registered long before." 

In summary, remain vigilant and check whether a story really comes from a reliable news source.

, features Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump against a backdrop of missiles and an explosion-filled sky. It includes the sensational caption "Apocalypse."

According to these propagandists, the issue's supposed theme is that Western approval for Ukraine's long-range strikes deep into Russian territory marks "the beginning of World War III."

! <image:103>

However, this cover is completely fake. It is not available on [The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 official website or [social media accounts](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
, where authentic covers are consistently published. Notably, the fake cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of all genuine Economist issues.

! <image:104>

! <image:105>

The actual Economist issue published on November 16 depicts a globe being struck by a golf club with the headline ["What's about to hit the world economy?"](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-11-16)
 The magazine's next issue, [scheduled for November 23,](http://https//www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-11-23)
 will focus on U.S. billionaire Elon Musk with the headline "Disrupter-in-chief."

! <image:106>

Some Russian media outlets promoting the fake cover have cited a Telegram channel called "The Economist," which is not affiliated with the British magazine. This channel is known for [disseminating disinformation](https://web.telegram.org/a/#-1002005877458)
 and pro-Kremlin content.

! <image:107>

By spreading such fabrications, Russian propaganda aims to intimidate Ukraine's Western allies, discouraging them from supporting Ukraine or allowing long-range strikes against targets deep in Russian territory. At the same time, these efforts seek to bolster the Kremlin dictator's image amid his increasing political isolation.

From [Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/): 
Content: "The supposed magazine cover is a fake.

AAP FACTCHECK – A fake cover of The Economist magazine depicting Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin against an apocalyptic background has been shared on social media and pushed by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel.

The faked image depicts US president-elect Trump and Russian President Putin in a face-to-face confrontation with missiles between them and the headline "APOCALYPSE".

The cover has turned up in [Facebook posts](https://mvau.lt/media/37ed0fb6-4352-4ad3-bc3a-25c86409fe78)
, in [X posts](https://mvau.lt/media/ac7986a3-4a4f-43f5-b479-8f1f205e5609)
 and on [Instagram](https://mvau.lt/media/fba74436-064c-4cad-8077-c56a8192eabc)
. 

The image bears The Economist's standard masthead and is accompanied by comments such as "...is Trump afraid to see how Biden's gang is starting a nuclear war?"

However, there are telltale signs the cover is fake. (Facebook/AAP)

*   "America pumbed-up economy" should read "America's pumped-up economy"
*   "Times up for TikTok" is missing the apostrophe in "Time's"
*   "industry" is missing an r in "A special report on oil industy"
*   "Biden left the White House" is untrue as Joe Biden is still the serving president.

Most of these cover lines appear, correctly spelled, on a genuine Economist cover from March 16, while the genuine February 24 cover featured Mr Putin and Mr Trump, in a different stance, with the headline "IS EUROPE READY?".

Fake Economist 'Apocalypse' cover linked to pro-Kremlin propaganda
==================================================================

David Williams November 28, 2024

!AAP FactCheck Feature Image Update 18 v3 <image:1580>

The supposed Economist magazine cover is fairly convincing, but it is a fake. Its leaders must urgently jettison their post-Soviet complacency and act before it is too late [https://t.co/qhmYsjLVTL](https://t.co/qhmYsjLVTL)
>  [pic.twitter.com/wPCoFUYk0A](https://t.co/wPCoFUYk0A)

> — The Economist (@TheEconomist) [February 22, 2024](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1760668341201461756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 covers archive does not include the fake cover and it doesn't appear anywhere else on the popular magazine's website.

AAP FactCheck contacted The Economist but did not receive a response before publication.

The fake cover has been shared as tensions heighten between Russia and the West over the US decision to allow Ukraine to use American long-range missiles against Russia.

Russia's response, a hypersonic missile launched against Ukraine on [November 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFBGwsXxSTQ)
, was reportedly a message to the West to ["back off"](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-sends-missile-message-west-back-off-2024-11-22/)
 if they want to avoid a missile strike against US and British targets.

Social media posts sharing the fake Economist cover promote the message that Putin does not want nuclear war, and that reports of a bomb – or World War III – are emanating from "the Cabal" (the West).

The fake cover has echoes of a similar fake in [June 2024](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/economist-did-not-publish-cover-warning-inevitable-nuclear-war-2024-06-14/)
, which depicted Mr Putin and President Joe Biden head to head over a chess game. 

[NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/fake-economist-cover-used-by-russia?open=false#%C2%A7pro-kremlin-sources-cite-fake-economist-cover-story-to-fearmonger-world-war-iii)
 has linked the most recent cover to pro-Kremlin sources, who it says have been pushing the fake image to warn that US and NATO support of Ukraine, particularly the recent missile decision, have brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

WHAT WAS CLAIMED

The Economist cover foreshadows apocalyptic conflict between the US and Russia.

OUR VERDICT

False. There is no publication date and spelling mistakes and errors appear in the cover lines (top right corner):

!Close-up of errors in fake Economist cover <image:1581> Several obvious errors in wording on the fake cover give away that it's a fake. (EPA PHOTO)

It cites Telegram channel @GolosMordora, which is affiliated with Russian intelligence services, as pushing the claim.

The fake cover was published [on Telegram](https://perma.cc/D4KR-L6XX)
 on November 18. 

Telegram translates the post into English as: "'Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the beginning of World War III,' warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.

"Experts have long suspected that the authors are backed by the global elite – they have predicted all the epochal events since 1983 with frightening accuracy. This was the case with the COVID-19 epidemic, the NWO and the conflict in the Middle East.

"In the warning for December-January: what radical measures will Russia take in response, which countries will intervene in the conflict and who will be the first to use nuclear weapons – read the analysis if you are not afraid to find out the truth."

The post ends with a link to a fake Economist Telegram account.

The Verdict

False – The claim is inaccurate.

Recovery operations at the site of a building hit in Russia's attack on July 8, 2024. (Interior Ministry / Telegram)

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)

 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)

Russian Federation’s Attack on Ukrainian Children’s Hospital ‘Not Only a War Crime’ but ‘Far Beyond the Limits of Humanity’, Medical Director Tells Security Council
====================================================================================================================================================================

‘There Has Been No Respite for Civilians in Ukraine’, Says Humanitarian Official

Amid a wave of the Russian Federation’s deadly missile attacks, targeting multiple cities across Ukraine on 8 July — including a strike that hit the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv — the United Nations top humanitarian official warned against a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health-care and other civilian infrastructure.

“There has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine”, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, adding that she was “shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”.  In Kyiv, the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital were severely damaged, and its toxicology department — where children receive dialysis — was destroyed.  “Russia started this war and Russia can end it at any time”, she underscored, reaffirming support for Ukraine.

The representative of the United Kingdom said that, in its repeated attacks against Ukraine since 23 February 2022, the Russian Federation has killed, maimed and abducted Ukrainian children.  Further, on 8 July, it attacked a children’s hospital. “This is cowardly depravity, and this must stop”, she underscored, stating that the intentional direction of attacks against civilian populations and objects constitutes a war crime. Stressing that Moscow’s conduct “is a disgrace to the Security Council and, especially, to the President’s seat”, she urged those present to jointly condemn the Russian Federation’s actions. For its part, the United Kingdom and its partners “will continue to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself from these barbaric acts of violence” and — at the ongoing summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — “will demonstrate our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes”.  Moscow must end its aggression against Ukraine and withdraw its forces.  “And stop killing Ukrainian children”, she added.

The representative of Japan lamented that the Council met “once again to confront the grim reality” caused by the Russian Federation’s escalating attacks across Ukraine, including a barrage of missiles that caused serious damage and many casualties at a pediatric hospital in Kyiv.  She wished that the children there would get prompt and appropriate care.  The Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) is verifying figures while rescue workers, hospital staff and volunteers continue to clear rubble in search of people trapped under debris. Health officials report that what remains of the children’s hospital is without electricity, preventing the use of ventilators and other urgent care.  UN Human Rights staff has helped move child patients to other facilities while providing psychosocial support and assisting with other urgent needs. She also highlighted “a massive outpouring of solidarity” from local residents, who rushed to the scene to help remove rubble and provide blankets, water and food for patients and medical staff. Furthermore, at least seven civilians were killed at the ISIDA medical centre in Kyiv — one of Ukraine’s largest women’s health and family planning centres — when debris from an intercepted missile hit the facility.

“Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”, she asserted, adding that these incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health care and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Attacks have intensified since the spring of 2024.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022.  Multilateral efforts that preserve diplomatic frameworks are the best way to achieve concrete solutions, he said.

The representative of Malta, noting that the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital is a beneficiary of the technical cooperation programme run by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that the missile attack against it “not only endangers lives, but also constitutes a violation of IAEA’s core principles and values”.  Health and educational facilities “must always be protected” to ensure uninterrupted delivery of their services to all people in Ukraine, she stressed, calling for the immediate cessation of all attacks against hospitals, residential buildings and critical infrastructure in Ukraine and on all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law.  The attacks on 8 July took place amidst Moscow’s new military offensive in the Kharkiv region, but attacks throughout 2024 have endangered the lives of thousands of children, health-care workers and civilians. Against that backdrop, she stressed: “The perpetrators of these actions must be held accountable for the damage done.”

The representative of Mozambique said that civilian deaths, both intentional and incidental, must not be condoned, urging warring parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  The respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be upheld under any circumstance.  Okhmatdyt Hospital was just one of many targets in the heavy missile strike which hit Kyiv and other cities on 8 July, he said, noting that the Russian Federation launched 38 missiles, attacking almost 100 civilian sites.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022, she asserted that “intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”.

Describing the 8 July attack on the children’s hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir, the Director of Okhmatdyt, said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  “At 10:42 a.m.  Describing the 8 July attack on the facility, he said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  Noting ongoing negotiations regarding Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee deep in children's blood in the chair’s seat here?”  The representative of the Russian Federation will bypass purgatory and end up in hell forever, he said, calling on the Council to respond to that country’s aggression and war crimes as well as address the issue of its presence in the permanent seat of the Soviet Union.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that the Russian Federation’s recent large-scale missile attacks are “a stark reminder” of why the Russian Federation Armed Forces are listed by the UN as a perpetrator of grave violations against children.  He stressed: “By targeting Okhmatdyt — a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine — Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and its utter insincerity about peace talks.”  Further, he pointed to the “striking paradox” of a Member State currently holding the presidency of the Council — the organ responsible for maintaining peace and security — while intensifying, “as we speak”, attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  Citing an OHCHR report documenting Moscow’s targeting of energy infrastructure and use of “double-tap” strikes, he stressed:  “These are the facts.”

Against that backdrop, he underscored that the Russian Federation and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression and for other serious international crimes — “as well as for the massive damage caused by their war”.  The General Assembly will soon vote on a resolution regarding the threats posed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as this marks the first time in history that a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been illegally seized by a foreign aggressor.  “History matters here”, he stressed, stating that history — including the 1986 Chernobyl disaster — teaches the existential importance of nuclear safety and security. “Russia’s irresponsible actions place all of us at risk, and that is why we hope — and expect — that all UN Member States will support this initiative”, he urged.

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation forces have targeted the largest Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia, the largest Ukrainian water dam in Khakovka and now Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in Kyiv.  He cited estimates by media experts that the Kremlin spent as much as $250 million on Monday’s missile barrage against targets in several Ukrainian cities.  Instead of using the money to treat their own children, Moscow “prefers to spend hundreds of millions on killing children in Ukraine”.  “We must move from the logic of domination and force to the logic of diplomacy and the peaceful solution of the conflict”, he said.

Along similar lines, the speaker for Sierra Leone underlined that the devastating impact of the reported overnight missile strikes on civilians is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the violence to end and a renewed commitment to protecting civilian lives and infrastructure in conflict zones.  “It also begs for independent investigations”, he said, urging the involved parties to “choose and prioritize peace”.

On 8 July, Moscow deliberately targeted “perhaps the most vulnerable and defenceless group in any society — children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses”, said Ukraine’s delegate.  Holding up images of the missile’s flight trajectory, as well as pictures of missile fragments retrieved from under the hospital, he said the footage shows that the hospital was a deliberate target.  Turning to ongoing negotiations regarding the Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee-deep in children’s blood in the Chair’s seat here?”

Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to counter that a missile from the Ukrainian air defence hit the children’s hospital in an attempt to intercept a Russian missile that was meant to hit a factory.  He pointed out that this tragedy — which falls within the pattern of Ukrainian and Western propaganda — occurred on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit.  “If this was a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building and all the children would have been killed and not wounded”, he said, emphasizing that Moscow does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Briefings

JOYCE MSUYA, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that, since June, “there has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine” amid continuing waves of attacks across the entire country.  “I was particularly shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”, she stated.  These attacks struck vital energy infrastructure, as well as two of the country’s leading specialist hospitals for children and women."

A massive [missile](/wiki/Missile "Missile")
 attack on Ukraine occurred on 8 July 2024 during the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")

 came under fire from more than forty missiles of the [Russian military](/wiki/Russian_military "Russian military")
.[\[8\]](#cite_note-FT07082024-8)
 In total, at least 47 people were killed and about 170 were injured.[\[9\]](#cite_note-BBC_cd162vj804go-9)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-kyiv_independent_200-10)
 In Kyiv, strikes damaged residential buildings and infrastructure, notably including the [Okhmatdyt](/wiki/Okhmatdyt "Okhmatdyt")
 children's hospital, the country's largest, which killed two adults.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

 The international community condemned the attacks. Presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
 stated that calls for an "immediate ceasefire" by [Hungary](/wiki/Hungary "Hungary")
 and [China](/wiki/China "China")

*   #### **Attack on the Children’s Hospital and Kremlin Disinformation**
    

On the evening of July 8, Russia [launched](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/articles/c51y4r82y87o)
 an airstrike on several cities in Ukraine. According to the Ministry of Internal [Affairs](https://www.unian.ua/war/ohmatdit-kijiv-nazvano-ostatochne-chislo-zhertv-ta-postrazhdalih-novini-kiyeva-12690879.html#goog_rewarded)
, 31 people, including 8 children, were injured, and 2 died on the clinic’s premises.

The attack on the children’s hospital was confirmed by international organizations. The international human rights organization Amnesty International also responded to the bombing of the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital, [noting](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/07/ukraine-major-damage-to-childrens-hospital-by-direct-russian-missile-hit-dozens-killed-across-the-country/)
 that Russian missile strikes across Ukraine resulted in civilian casualties and damaged the children’s hospital buildings. Verification [determined](https://mythdetector.com/en/disinformation-as-of-the-children-s-hospital-in-kyiv-was-damaged-by-a-ukrainian-air-defense-missile/)
 that the attack was carried out indeed with a Russian missile.

**The video allegedly showing that actor doctors with red paint were involved in the bombing of a children’s hospital in Kyiv does not reflect reality. The rocket attack and the injuries of Ukrainians have been confirmed by international organizations."

The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:8>)
web_search("Kyiv pediatric hospital attack July 8 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The Kyiv Independent published an article on July 9, 2024, reporting on a Russian strike in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, that hit a building in the Schevchenkyvskyi district, resulting in the death of a boy. The article mentions that the Okhmatdyt hospital was also directly targeted in the attack. The image <image:8>

### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report on the missile attack on the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024. Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, stating that the attack killed at least 42 civilians, including five children. The United Nations also reported on the attack, which was condemned by multiple parties as a war crime. The Russian Federation denies targeting the hospital.

The Wikipedia article "8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine" describes the missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on July 8, 2024, which resulted in at least 47 deaths and 189 injuries, including damage to the Okhmatdyt children's hospital. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed the strikes targeted defense industry targets and aviation bases. The international community condemned the attacks. The article includes images of the damage <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image <image:8> was taken at the scene of the attack. The evidence does not provide information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

The claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence would be needed to determine if the toys were added to the image.

Russian Missile Identified in Kyiv Children’s Hospital Attack
=============================================================

July 9, 2024

*   [Missile](/tag/missile)
    
*   [Russia](/tag/russia)
    

An analysis of open source evidence, as well as missile experts, have pointed to a Russian launched Kh-101 cruise missile being the weapon that struck a children’s hospital in Kyiv, debunking claims from pro-Russian accounts and actors that denied responsibility and sought to shift the blame for the incident on to Ukraine.

The July 8 attack on the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital [killed two](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/7qtQnWmyiTiwJ19F/)
 and injured over 50 others, according to the hospital. According to [the Ukrainian Air Force](https://t.me/kpszsu/16341)
, the attack began at approximately 10:00 AM local time and involved at least 36 missiles, including 13 Kh-101 cruise missiles.

**Analysing the Missile Strike Footage**
----------------------------------------

Shortly before noon, [reports began to surface](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56544)
 claiming that there had been an explosion at the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital. However, the full toll of dead and injured remains unknown with individuals [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/rescuers-search-rubble-of-kyiv-childrens-hospital-after-russian-missile-attack-in-ukraine)
 to still be trapped under rubble.

In the aftermath of the strike, several social media accounts known for spreading disinformation — including that of the [Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://x.com/mfa_russia/status/1810307880244965438)
 — began to claim that the missile was American-made and that it had been launched from a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system. 

Yet an analysis conducted by Bellingcat using social media footage as well as  a 3D model of the missile, all point to the munition being a [Russian Kh-101 cruise missile](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/kh-101-kh-102/)
. Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons and missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, similarly concluded in an email to Bellingcat that a Kh-101 missile could be seen in footage of the attack posted to social media sites.

Bellingcat also tested an alternative theory floated online that the missile was a US-made AIM-120, but found no evidence for this.

The hospital attack came as part of a wider Russian missile barrage that hit civilian targets elsewhere in Ukraine, including the city of Dnipro.

After the strike, the SBU [released three images](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/slidchi-sbu-vstanovyly-shcho-rf-udaryla-po-okhmatdytu-raketoiu-kh101)
 claiming to show remnants of the munition that hit the hospital. On the right is a crop of a remnant image (flipped horizontally for clarity) released by the SBU after the Kyiv hospital attack. <image:9900>

The hospital was far from the only target during the Russian attack of July 8. These reports were followed by video footage posted to Telegram showing a missile impacting the hospital.

This is not Hinkle’s first fake about a missile attack on Okhmatdyt.  [![Spilnota Detector Media](https://disinfo.detector.media/images/client/banner-en.jpg)](https://spilnota.detector.media/)

[![Русскій фейк, іді на***!](https://disinfo.detector.media/images/client/podcast_en.jpg?v1.0)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%B9-%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BA-%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%96-%D0%BD%D0%B0/id1613169454)

Pro-Russian sources disseminated information about the alleged fakeness of photographs of the State Emergency Service from the scene of the tragedy that occurred as a result of the Russian shelling of the Okhmatdyt children's hospital on July 8, 2024. In particular, on his page in X, American blogger Jackson Hinkle published one of the photographs of the State Emergency Service, which depicts children's toys in the ruins of a hospital, and wrote: “The Ukrainian government inserted fake children's toys into the image of the hospital it destroyed in Kyiv”.

In fact, no one inserted toys into the photo, writes the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council. Thus, an American blogger, known for his commitment to Russia, claimed on his page on the social network X that Okhmatdyt seemed to have been hit by an American Patriot air defense missile, which was allegedly fired by Ukraine. However, SBU investigators determined that the attack was carried out by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile.

By spreading such lies, the blogger is trying to discredit the Ukrainian government and divert the attention of the world community from yet another Russian war crime.

NGO “Detector Media” has been working for our readers for over 20 years."

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

The $128 billion figure counts committed aid, much of which has yet to be delivered, according to an [analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraine-now-doomed "analysis")

NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the [risk of a nuclear war](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war "risk of a nuclear war")
. In addition, after widely broadcast friction between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a February 28 Oval Office visit, European nations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all stepped up pledges of support.

Critical Questions by Mark F. While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the U.S. provided approximately $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). The claim states that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim is not supported. The evidence suggests a much lower figure for military aid.

To verify the claim, I would need information on the total military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025.

NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. <image:496>, <image:497>

CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) discusses the Trump administration's military aid to Ukraine, including weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, in addition to $310 million approved in May. <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. provided approximately $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). The claim states that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim is not supported. The evidence suggests a much lower figure for military aid.

To verify the claim, I would need information on the total military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025.

But now a member of his family has publicly criticised him: his cousin Nate has slammed the politician for his behaviour towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting at the White House.

Nate Vance, who fought on the front line of the Russo-Ukrainian war for three years, has said he finds it strange that his cousin never contacted him, despite knowing he had first-hand experience of developments in Ukraine.

Nate Vance has shot into the public eye after giving numerous interviews voicing his disapproval of his cousin’s treatment of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky during their infamous White House meeting. February’s televised encounter in the Oval Office saw Vance accuse Zelensky of campaigning for the Democrats and of being disrespectful and ungrateful towards the present US administration.

Speaking to The Independent, Nate said his cousin and Trump bullied Zelensky because they “can’t really push [\[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/entertainment/article/3288698/who-vladimir-putins-rumoured-secret-daughter-luiza-rozova-russian-president-reportedly-shares-paris?module=inline&pgtype=article)

Content: "And speaking of which, why is Elon Musk in the Oval Office wearing a baseball hat and a T-shirt all the time?"

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

JD Vance's cousin criticises him for 'belittling' Zelensky

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)
, satellite imagery and [intelligence sharing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn52k5n5w24o)
 to Kyiv.

[Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has eschewed suits for military-style dress in what he says is solidarity with soldiers.

"Everyone knows that's why he does that and it's kind of a symbolic thing," Nate Vance said."

Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa expresses fear and distaste at how Trump treats Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

After Friday's contentious meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the White House was sent a letter. His letter was signed by dozens of other former Polish political prisoners.

ANDRZEJ BOBINKSI: Nobody wants to say anything too vivid, too aggressive towards, you know, Donald Trump and the United States. And I think that, you know, by the end of Donald Trump's term, Poland will be in a very different place.

SCHMITZ: And Walesa's scathing letter, says Bobinski, is a sign of Poland turning away from its longtime friend. As NPR's Central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz reports, the letter expressed to the Trump administration what the Polish government cannot.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: The letter begins with your excellency Mr. and its historical antipathy towards Russia.

BOBINKSI: Donald Trump is way too lenient and way too friendly towards Vladimir Putin. And I don't think anybody has come out outright and said that we don't want to be friends with the United States anymore.

SCHMITZ: Certainly not Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, who made this statement after the Oval Office incident.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK: (Speaking Polish).

SCHMITZ: "I know a narrative is being created, especially after that very strange Friday at the White House," said Tusk, "that would divide Europe and the United States. It goes on to compare Trump and Vance's treatment of Zelenskyy to interrogations by political police under communist Poland, and it demands more respect for a leader whose soldiers are shedding blood to defend the free world. We do not understand, the letter says, how the leader of a country that is a symbol of the free world cannot see that. The author is Lech Walesa, former leader of Poland's Solidarity movement, the first Democratically elected president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his leadership in opposing communist rule. "We cannot allow that to happen," he said."

WARSAW — Poland’s democracy hero Lech Walesa and dozens of other former political prisoners in Poland have written a letter to President Trump, telling him that his treatment of Ukraine’s president at the Oval Office last week filled them “with horror and distaste.”

Walesa, who served as president soon after Poland embraced democracy, and the others tell Trump that they found it offensive that he expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show respect and gratitude for the materiel assistance the United States has given Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The letter expressed Wałęsa's "horror" at Trump's argument with Zelenskyy. The letter was also signed by dozens of former Polish political prisoners.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but it lacks specific information about the military aid suspension.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The letter expressed Wałęsa's "horror" at Trump's argument with Zelenskyy. The letter was also signed by dozens of former Polish political prisoners.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but it lacks specific information about the military aid suspension.

The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025 criticizing his behavior toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The initial search did not provide information about the specific content of the letter regarding military aid. A second search was performed, but no new evidence was found.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking Wałęsa's letter to the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

(Kyiv, October 30, 2024) – [Ukraine’s](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/ukraine)
 new [law](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3894-IX)
 banning religious organizations with ties to the [Russian](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia)
 Orthodox Church is overly broad and could have far-reaching consequences for Ukrainians’ right to religious freedom, Human Rights Watch said today. He noted that there are Ukrainian Orthodox Church congregations in occupied territories that “refuse to join the Russian Orthodox Churchfor many reasons.” He said that the ban would sever the connection with those churches, and that the “Russian Orthodox Church will put their own people in place and that will be the end of it.”

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented multiple incidents in which groups of people forcefully entered churches belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Сhurch, “[justifying their actions](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/ukraine/2024/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-dec-2023-29-feb-2024.pdf)
 with decisions from local authorities to register new religious communities of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine at the same address as existing Ukrainian Orthodox Churchcommunities.” In September, Ukraine [blocked](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/rozporyadzhennya-ncu-vid-12-09-2024-769-2574-pro-blokuvannya-domennikh-imen)
 the website of the outlet DialogTUT, which covered Ukrainian Orthodox Church activities.

Ukraine is obligated under Ukrainian and international law to guarantee religious freedom. The law does not impact the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities should address any security concerns related to the activities of religious bodies or personnel that threaten state security, whether by individuals or specific religious communities, rather than effectively banning entire religious communities based solely on presumed affiliations with the Russian Orthodox Church, Human Rights Watch said. 

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s security service has initiated criminal proceedings [against](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/get-vid-moskvi-k-radi-zbirayutsya-zaboroniti-1723413259.html)
 at least 100 clergymen, most affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on charges of “collaborationism,” treason, and“aiding the aggressor state.” 

Broad implementation of the new law risks severe practical consequences for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s congregations and millions of parishioners, Human Rights Watch said. It said it would develop regulations to implement the law within three months of its publication, to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 

The law considers any ties, not just institutional and organizational, but also canonical, with the Russian Orthodox Church to be grounds for banning it. 

Requiring the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to sever canonical ties may cast doubt on the legitimacy of its adherents’ religious beliefs, which the European Court of Human Rights has identified as a key element of the right to freedom of religion, Human Rights Watch said. “But the law interferes with the right to freedom of religion and is so broad that it could violate the rights of Ukrainian Orthodox Church members.”

The Ukrainian government should suspend implementation of the law and request the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe’s’ Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to provide expert analysis of the law that would be the basis for its rights-respecting revision, Human Rights Watch said.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church was [established](https://risu.ua/ukrajinska-pravoslavna-cerkva-moskovskogo-patriarhatu_n48337)
 in 1990 as an autonomous branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leadership supports Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Yet, in January 2023, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience found these steps insufficient, stating that the “status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as a structural subdivision of the Russian Orthodox Church... remains unchanged.”

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church exists alongside the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was [established](https://www.pomisna.info/uk/document-post/patriarshyj-i-synodalnyj-tomos-nadannya-avtokefalnogo-tserkovnogo-ustroyu-pravoslavnij-tserkvi-v-ukrayini/)
 in 2019 under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. They range from restrictions on ownership and operation of religious properties to difficulties in accessing places of worship and heightened risk of security service surveillance and prosecution.

Any prosecution or penalty not based on specific, unlawful actions but solely on the adherence to a peaceful practice of faith, constitutes religious discrimination and is prohibited by international human rights law. 

In a written response to questions Human Rights Watch sent on October 2, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience said that the law’s main objective is “to prevent the network of religious organizations officially registered in Ukraine from being used against Ukraine.” 

The agency said that Ukraine “does not demand that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church betray the doctrine of the Orthodox Church, change liturgical practices or language, switch to a different liturgical calendar, or join another church jurisdiction. The only requirement that the Law insists on is withdrawing from the Russian Orthodox Church, which is involved in the war against Ukraine.”

The agency also shared recommendations on measures that could be taken to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church."

 published that The Independent's White House correspondent [Andrew Feinberg](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/andrew-feinberg)
 — who served as White House pool reporter at Joint Base Andrews — confirmed Biden boarded the plane to greet the people still onboard after the freed prisoners had deplaned. The caption clearly states Biden stepped onto the plane "to talk to the pilot who flew the former prisoners."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.
> 
> — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) [August 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1819025395804717182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, **Stephen Capus**, has [said](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-prisoner-swap-belarus-gershkovich-whelan-alsu/33059280.html)
 that the broadcaster welcomed news of RFE/RL journalist **Alsu Kurmasheva**’s “imminent release and are grateful to the American government and all who worked tirelessly to end her unjust treatment by Russia.”

> Alsu’s release makes us even more determined to secure the freedom of three other RFE/RL journalists, cruelly imprisoned in Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea.

His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time.

Content: "26, 2024, 6:29 AM EDT

By [Alex Seitz-Wald](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alex-seitz-wald-ncpn385646)
 and [Katherine Doyle](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/katherine-doyle-ncpn1304357)

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a trip to the U.S., while former President Donald Trump isn’t, highlighting the growing partisan division over a key foreign policy issue.

Harris is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelenskyy at the White House. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Sept. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”

Zelenskyy had implied that he was going to meet with Trump this week, but Trump's campaign said there had been no formal agreement for a meeting.

Trump has been saying for months, and he has repeated more frequently at rallies this week, that he would immediately end the war in Ukraine — even if it was on terms favorable to Moscow — and he dismissed Zelenskyy as a “great salesman” for securing money for his country who “so badly” wants Democrats to win to keep the money flowing.

“Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,” Trump said Tuesday in Georgia."

====================================================================================

She took aim at those who've floated Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

September 26, 2024, 6:13 PM

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged to continue support to Ukraine as she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his so-called "victory plan" to bring an end to war with Russia.

Harris cast the conflict as a fight for fundamental principles of "freedom and independence."

"We also know that other would-be aggressors around the world are watching to see what happens in Ukraine," Harris said. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable," she added.

Harris also appeared to take a swipe at her political opponents -- former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. 26, 2024, in the vice president's ceremonial office inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex.

After sources said Wednesday Trump was not expected to meet with Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon Zelenskyy had asked to meet and that they would do so Friday morning at Trump Tower.

"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly," Trump said. We need to stop the death and destruction."

Zelenskyy has called Vance "too radical," taking issue with his [statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/12/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan/)
 that a Trump-Vance administration's approach to the war would likely include Ukraine ceding territory to Russia and the current line of demarcation becoming a demilitarized zone. Johnson told reporters he would not be in town, but if he had sat down with Zelenskyy, would have aired grievances about his tour of an American munitions manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania.

Zelenskyy made the case to lawmakers for permission to strike deeper into Russia at military targets using U.S.-supplied weapons. Several senators on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire for Biden to give Zelenskyy authorization to do so.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. News reports mention Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and meetings with Harris and U.S. lawmakers. Some Republicans viewed Zelenskyy's actions as a signal of his preference in the election.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. However, the reports suggest that his actions, such as visiting a munitions plant and meeting with Harris, were perceived by some as a form of support.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether Zelenskyy's actions were intended to influence the election and whether they constituted campaigning.

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

Best of AP — Second Winner

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Associated Press on February 1, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention the content of Zelenskyy's statements regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine. Therefore, it is impossible to verify whether Zelenskyy stated that his country's military had received only a portion of the U.S. aid, nor whether he made any claims about the aid being a money laundering operation.

To verify the claim, the content of the AP interview needs to be examined. Specifically, the exact statements made by Zelenskyy regarding the amount of aid received and any related comments about its use are required.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 1, 2025, the Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) published an interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy discussed the dangers of excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks and mentioned his team's contact with the Trump administration.

U.S. News & World Report ([Source](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy)) also summarized the AP interview, focusing on Zelenskyy's statements on talks between Moscow and Washington, the role of NATO, and skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine. The AP also published an article titled "AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’" ([Source](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/second-winner/2025/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-u-s-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/)) <image:2123>, <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Associated Press on February 1, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention the content of Zelenskyy's statements regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine. Therefore, it is impossible to verify whether Zelenskyy stated that his country's military had received only a portion of the U.S. aid, nor whether he made any claims about the aid being a money laundering operation.

To verify the claim, the content of the AP interview needs to be examined. Specifically, the exact statements made by Zelenskyy regarding the amount of aid received and any related comments about its use are required.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump \[AFP\]

By Jeff Cercone | PolitiFact

Published On 21 Feb 202521 Feb 2025

United States President Donald Trump has made a series of claims about Ukraine and its leader as he seeks to [end](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 the country’s three-year war with Russia.

Trump’s relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soured publicly as Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and said he “started” the war with Russia, a claim PolitiFact rated [pants-on-fire false](/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims)
. A search of Google and the Nexis news database found no reports of polls showing Zelenskyy with a 4 percent approval rating.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted February 4-9, Zelenskyy had a trust rating of 57 percent among 1,000 Ukrainians surveyed. Trump’s figure nearly doubles the amount that Congress has appropriated or made available since the war began.

Ukraine Oversight – the website of the special inspector general for Operation Atlantic Resolve, which the US government created in 2014 to coordinate its military aid to Ukraine – said that as of September 30, the US had spent $183bn to help Ukraine.

Mark Cancian, a senior defence and security adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the amount the US has spent varies depending on what is being counted as “aid to Ukraine” but most estimates are in the range of $175bn to $185bn.

“No matter what you add, however, the total doesn’t get close to $350bn,” Cancian said.

The numbers cited by Trump in terms of aid to Ukraine contradict data from the US government itself. The war of words has escalated after Zelenskyy accused Trump of repeating [Russian misinformation](/news/2025/2/20/trump-vs-zelenskyy-whats-behind-escalating-war-of-words)

Trump, who sent a team to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin negotiations on ending the war that did not include Ukraine, described Zelenskyy as a “modestly successful comedian” who was only good at playing former US President Joe Biden “like a fiddle”.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. “To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.”

Putin’s false rationalisations for the war were named PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year in 2022.

Claim: Zelenskyy is a dictator
------------------------------

A professor who researches democracy and dictatorships said this is a mischaracterisation.

Zelenskyy was democratically elected in March 2019 to a five-year term with more than 73 percent of the vote. “Clearly, the term dictator does not apply to Zelenskyy, just as it does not apply to Churchill.”

A spokesperson for United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC it was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War II” and Zelenskyy is Ukraine’s “democratically elected leader”.

Putin won re-election to another six-year term in March in an election the US National Security Council said was “obviously not free nor fair”.

“Trump would be correct to use the term dictator to describe Putin, who has used fake elections to remain in power for a quarter of a century,” Moghaddam said.

Claim: Zelenskyy has a 4 percent approval rating
------------------------------------------------

This is inaccurate. That poll, Ukrainska Pravda said, is tied to the former chief political strategist of Ukraine’s fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, who Zelenskyy beat in 2019.

Claim: The US has spent $350bn to help Ukraine
----------------------------------------------

This is inaccurate. The official amount spent by the US on Ukraine is $183bn.

Zelenskyy wasn’t saying that the rest of the money was missing. Of $175bn appropriated by Congress, much of it was spent in the US on weapons manufacturers and US military and government operations.

Claim: Zelenskyy was ‘sleeping and unavailable’ to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week in Kyiv
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photos show this is inaccurate."

 !Zelenskyy: Ukraine received US$76 billion out of US$177 billion approved by America <image:3378>

Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We’re talking about tangible things because this aid didn’t come as cash but rather as weapons, which amounted to about US$70 billion.

But when it’s said that Ukraine received US$200 billion to support the army during the war – that’s not true. Probably, these various organisations were funded by different foundations."

**Background:**

*   In November 2024, Zelenskyy stated that [Ukraine has not received](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/11/16/7484807/)
     even half of the weapons officially allocated by the United States and that Europe has helped Ukraine just as much as the US.  
*   On his first day as president, Donald Trump signed an executive order [suspending all foreign aid programmes](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/21/7202989/)
     for 90 days to assess their alignment with his political goals. Officials and NGO representatives in Ukraine warned that without Rubio’s authorisation, essential programs, including support for schools, hospitals and efforts to develop economic and energy infrastructure, could face significant setbacks.
*   On 26 January, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine [was ordered to suspend all projects](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)
     and expenditures following a directive from the US Department of State. It’s significant aid, but it’s not US$200 billion." 

**Details:** Regarding the suspension of funding for humanitarian programmes, Zelenskyy highlighted specific cases such as a US$200 million energy-related programme and others in healthcare and border security.

**Quote:** "Those US$300-400 million are the programmes the state received."

On February 1, 2025, the Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) published an interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy discussed the dangers of excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks and mentioned his team's contact with the Trump administration.

U.S. News & World Report ([Source](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy)) also summarized the AP interview, focusing on Zelenskyy's statements on talks between Moscow and Washington, the role of NATO, and skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine. The AP also published an article titled "AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’" ([Source](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/second-winner/2025/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-u-s-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/)) <image:2123>, <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Associated Press on February 1, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention the content of Zelenskyy's statements regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine. Therefore, it is impossible to verify whether Zelenskyy stated that his country's military had received only a portion of the U.S. aid, nor whether he made any claims about the aid being a money laundering operation.

To verify the claim, the content of the AP interview needs to be examined. Specifically, the exact statements made by Zelenskyy regarding the amount of aid received and any related comments about its use are required.

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)

).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)
 "A fundraising crypto foundation [@\_AidForUkraine](https://twitter.com/_AidForUkraine)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Newsweek published an article discussing the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The article mentions that the claim originated from social media and was spread by right-leaning commentators. It also mentions that the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine in March 2022. The article states that there is no evidence to support the claim that funds were laundered from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S. <image:2147>. The article also mentions that funding for Ukraine received bipartisan support.

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

# Your Summary

Content: "REUTERS [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
. 

The Mueller probe catalyzed further inquires by House Democrats in Congress and continues to be mentioned in [discussions on the escalating Ukraine scandal](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/464845-house-lawyer-says-impeachment-probe-could-go-beyond-ukraine)
 that's sparked an [impeachment inquiry into Trump.](https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-announce-trump-impeachment-inquiry-2019-9)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Top political, business and sporting figures reeling from their offshore banking activities making the front pages of newspapers around the world got a backhanded boost from an unlikely source on Wednesday.

French satire magazine "Charlie Hebdo" depicted a caricatured group of cigar-smoking people holding signs reading "Je suis Panama," "Don't be afraid," and "They won't change our way of life."

Headlined "Tax Terrorism," the cover recycled many of the declarations of solidarity made following the terrorist attack at the French magazine in January 2015 that killed 11 people. The French phrase "Je suis," or "I am," followed by a city name after terrorist attacks or by a social cause has gone on to be used on social media on several occasions.

Je suis Panama was not the only time the Paris-based magazine recently grabbed attention. An [editorial published in last week's edition](https://charliehebdo.fr/en/edito/how-did-we-end-up-here/)
 was widely regarded as blaming all Muslims for Islamist terrorism. The magazine's cover, addressing the Brussels terror attacks, also came under fire.

From [Source](https://babel.ua/en/news/118302-charlie-hebdo-magazine-sued-over-fake-covers-mocking-ukraine): Found exact image on website with title: Charlie Hebdo magazine sued over fake covers mocking Ukraine
Content: "French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has filed a complaint in a Paris court alleging that its covers, which mock Ukraine, and in particular President Volodymyr Zelensky, are fake.

This [is reported](https://charliehebdo.fr/2025/05/societe/justice/non-poutine-nest-pas-le-nouveau-directeur-de-charlie-hebdo/)
 on the magazineʼs website.

“ʼCover art’ that mimics the style of the publication and unceremoniously uses the signatures of its artists is appearing on the Internet. Who is behind this deception? We don’t know yet, so we have filed a complaint against an unidentified person. All of these clumsy fakes have one thing in common: they denigrate Ukraine, ridicule European support for President Volodymyr Zelensky, and sometimes spread rumors about the gender identity of \[French First Lady\] Brigitte Macron. You start to wonder if Putin himself ordered them,” the magazine said.

  

An example of a fake cover spread allegedly by Charlie Hebdo. The characters are Volodymyr Zelensky, French and US presidents Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump.

In the complaint, the magazine [notes](https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/charlie-hebdo-porte-plainte-contre-x-apres-la-publication-de-fausses-unes-pro-poutine-20250526)
 that over the past two years, at least 15 fake magazine covers with comments and captions in Russian have been published on Telegram and the social network X. According to the Charlie Hebdo editorial team, the covers are designed for a Russian audience to create the impression that Charlie Hebdo supports Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

"The authors of the hoax hope to make people think that Charlie Hebdo is a pro-Putin and anti-Zeleno newspaper. Propaganda is working at full capacity, and it would be a mistake to continue to underestimate its harmful influence," the publishers stressed.

Fake Charlie Hebdo cover.

So Charlie Hebdoʼs editorial board went to court to "dispel the doubts that these manipulations may raise in the public consciousness". The magazine said it hoped to find "at least the authors, and possibly the sponsors, of this propaganda".

*   Charlie Hebdo is a French weekly magazine of political satire. It publishes cartoons, reports, discussions and jokes of a nonconformist nature. It ridicules politicians, the far-right, Islam and Christianity.

Charlie Archive Collection

The 2015 terrorist attack against the staff of the French satirical magazine _Charlie Hebdo_ provoked a vigorous debate about fundamental political and ethical issues. This archive aims to document the events and ensuing debate.

Charlie Archive Collection

Issues that came to the fore following the attacks and are covered in this archive include freedom of expression; the relationship between state, religion and society; respect for other beliefs and perspectives; inequality; and the disenfranchisement of individuals and communities.

This archive, curated by Lidia Uziel, Head of Americas, Europe, and Oceania Division and build in collaboration with Harvard librarians, faculty members, and students, contains a wide array of materials and perspectives from individuals with a range of political positions and social backgrounds.

Though the events and later protests were concentrated in France, extensive media coverage drew global attention. _"__Je suis Charlie" (_"I am Charlie") or _"Je ne suis pas Charlie"_ ("I am not Charlie") became international expressions of adhesion to or distance from the stance attributed to _Charlie Hebdo_ on religion in general and to Islam in particular.

The goal of the archive is to document a moment in the early 21st century when the word “Charlie” took on tragic significance and became charged with conflicting emotions, opinions, and agendas.

Accessing These Materials

Claves:

*   The disinformation campaign that claims that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has paid for celebrities to visit Ukraine has spread in at least nine languages
*   Maldita.es has analyzed more than 40 Twitter posts (now X) with this narrative that, in just three days, has more than 20 million views and only 14% have a note from the community denying it
*   Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have published this disinformation narrative since the first day it began to be distributed

  

* * *

The video claiming that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [has paid for visits by several prominent US officials to Ukraine](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 has gone viral with (fake) messages **in at least nine different languages** ​​(German, Spanish, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian). Its impact has thus crossed borders, reaching more than 20 million views [on Twitter (now X)](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230724/twitter-x-cambio-nombre-logo-elon-musk/)
 in just three days.

para que no te la cuelen!](https://bit.ly/3EGa2ju)

For this study, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has analysed [more than 40 posts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 (all of them with more than 5,000 views at 5pm on 7 February 2025) that spread this video with disinformation messages through X. These contents have been published over three days (between 5 and 7 February) and, together, they add up to millions of views on the platform. Even so, only 14.3% (that is, six out of 42) have [community notes](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
 warning users that it is disinformation content.

! <image:6457>

The narrative was also widely disseminated by channels and websites linked to or close to the Kremlin, both in Spain and in Russia and other countries between February 5 and 7.

**This disinformation narrative has 20 million views in three days and nine languages**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The narrative shared in X:** USAID has sponsored visits by American celebrities (such as Angelina Jolie, Ben Stiller, Orlando Bloom, Sean Penn, and Jean-Claude Van Damme) to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, in order to boost Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s popularity in the United States and better coordinate its funding programs. Much of the content provides as supposed “proof” a video with the logo of [E!News, a “celebrity and entertainment news” website in the United States](https://archive.ph/s1f93)
.

**The fact-check:** [The video circulating is not from E!News](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
. There is also [**no evidence**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 **of USAID's alleged payments to the celebrities it mentions.** Ben Stiller, the American actor and comedian who is the subject of the disinformation, has said that it is “completely false.”

Even so, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [has located up to 42 contents with more than 5,000 views](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 as of February 7 that spread this narrative on X. These have been published between February 5 and 7, 2025 and are shared in at least seven languages ​​in addition to Spanish: German, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian. Some [have several million views](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 and, together (and in just three days), they add up to more than 20 million views within this platform alone.

**Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have been publishing this disinformation narrative since February 5**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since February 5, social media channels linked to the Kremlin or that routinely share disinformation pushed by Russia have also been spreading the video accusing USAID of paying Hollywood stars to travel to Ukraine.

On February 5, the X account “Russia Informa,” which has almost 80,000 followers, [shared the video](https://archive.li/OMGEP)
 with claims such as “USAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Kyiv after the start of the special operation. The E!News portal published the details. Angelina Jolie cost the most: 20 million.” Also [the Telegram channel](https://archive.ph/NEJeQ)
 “Irinamar,” which claims to share content with a “Russian view of the special operation in Ukraine,” or “[Wars and Geopolitics](https://archive.ph/rTjNU)
”, among others, published a post that same day.

On February 6, it was shared **by the website Spanish News Pravda**, a website that is part of the Pravda ecosystem and that, according to the [Viginum agency](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/notre-organisation/composantes/service-de-vigilance-et-protection-contre-les-ingerences-numeriques)
, belonging to the General Secretariat of National Defense and Security of France, “one of its main objectives is to spread disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda in different EU languages”. In Spain, [Spanish News Pravda has published](https://maldita.es/index.php/malditobulo/20241106/comitiva-rey-paginas-rusas-arabe/)
 disinformation such as the hoax about Felipe VI’s motorcade in Valencia after the passage of the DANA [or the hoax that Coca-Cola had donated mobile morgues](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241203/morgue-mobile-cocacola-ucrania/)
 with its logo to Ukraine. On this occasion, Spanish News Pravda published it on two occasions ([1](https://archive.ph/bqahS)
 and [2](https://archive.li/PdxYX)
).

Liu Sivaya [also shared the E!News video](https://archive.li/2hpjN)
 on the 6th on her X account, where she has nearly 200,000 followers.

! <image:6464>

Between February 5 and 6, it was also actively disseminated “by Russian propaganda outlets, including Tsargrad, Russia Today, EurAsia Daily, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Military Review, and Vesti,” explain Georgian fact-checkers [Myth Detector, who have also verified the content](https://mythdetector.com/en/usaid-paid-actors/)
. They add that it was shared not only by Kremlin-controlled outlets, “but also by networks affiliated with the Georgian government, including the pro-government POSTV, several media channels, as well as individual accounts,” as they identify in the published article.

! <image:6465>

**Only six of the 42 disinformation contents have Community Notes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publication of this text, 85.7% of the contents analysed (i.e. 37 out of 42) **are circulating on X without** [**community notes**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
. Only in six of the more than 40 cases does the warning system of Elon Musk's platform indicate that they are disinformation content. These posts are written in Spanish (3), German (1), French (1) and English (1). None of the contents with more than 5,000 views that have been taken into account in this analysis in Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch or Romanian contain these messages.

! <image:6466>

Those cases in which the Community Notes have been applied do not reach 125.000 views in any single post. In fact, [the tweet with the most impact](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 that [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has found with this narrative (which has, as of the date of publication of this text, more than 15.8 million views) [**does not have a visible warning**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/ben-stiller-tuit-desinformador-nota-comunidad/)
**,** more than 36 hours after its publication. It is the first post in a thread in English that states that “USAID paid Ben Stiller 4 million dollars to take these photos with Zelensky.” This message is accompanied by two images (which are real) of the American actor and comedian with the president of Ukraine.

! <image:6467>

[Community Notes is the system implemented](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
 in X that allows users to add context to misleading tweets. [Although this is only selected and displayed when it is rated](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/#:~:text=en%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%3F-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20funcionan%20las%20Notas%20de%20la%20comunidad%3F,-Las%20Notas%20de)
 as useful by enough contributors with “different points of view.” In fact**,** [**there are actually notes proposed**](https://archive.is/QieM8)
 **in the tweet with more than 15.8 million views**, as mentioned above. And why are they not displayed? Due to a lack of consensus between contributors, who present “different points of view” according to the platform’s rules.

! <image:6468>

This is precisely one of the points to improve the X Community Notes system identified by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [in its analysis](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
. One of the problems it raises is that many of the notes that are proposed and that refute viral misinformation are never shown to users. It also points against the need for consensus among users, who tend to disagree. 

Thus, several contexts have been identified in which community notes have not been sufficient to combat hoaxes. For example, [during the disinformation campaign](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20241127/dana-notas-comunidad-x-twitter/)
 that emerged on social networks as a result [of the DANA of October 2024](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241030/bulos-y-desinformaciones-sobre-el-paso-de-la-dana-en-el-este-y-sur-de-espana-en-octubre-de-2024/)
: out of 176 tweets analysed with disinformation narratives about heavy rains, only 8.5% had visible community notes. They were also not enough to stop the spread of the [hoax of the video of the European Parliament applauding the launch of missiles from Ukraine to Russia](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241125/parlamento-europeo-aplausos-misiles-ucrania/)
. This content was spread in at least [five different languages on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241126/bulo-parlamento-europeo-misiles-europa/)
 and none of those analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 had community notes.

**61.9% of posts are from users with a blue tick, but that does not mean they are trustworthy**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common factor detected in this analysis is that most of the accounts that have shared the narrative about USAID allegedly paying US celebrities to visit Ukraine in X **pay the premium version**. Of the 42 pieces of content analysed, **37 were published by users with the so-called** [**blue tick**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230421/Twitter-tic-azul-original-cambios/)
 (61.9% of the total). In fact, among the ten most viral tweets, there is only one tweet that does not have the blue tick.

! <image:6469>

The blue tick is no longer synonymous with the fact that a profile is verified and is who it claims to be. Now, [this badge is obtained by paying a subscription](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230331/tic-azul-twitter-blue-desinformacion-cuentas-verificadas/)
 fee, so anyone can access it. This change may give a false sense of security to the user viewing the content on their device.

**This disinformative narrative is circulated in at least nine languages within X**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents that have had the greatest impact so far are those disseminated in English. Of the 42 analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
, **13 have been published in English.** In total, they have had more than 18.4 million views (an average of 1.4 million per publication). 

! <image:6472>

[Why you can trust Sky News](/info/policies-and-standards)

Hollywood star Ben Stiller has met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling the actor-turned-leader: "You are my hero."

The US actor, 56, who has been meeting with refugees in **[Poland](https://news.sky.com/topic/poland-6132)
** and **[Ukraine](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
** since 18 June, shook hands with the wartime premier as they met in Kyiv.

**[UK would be 'right to prepare for war' - Ukraine war latest updates](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-war-russia-putin-eu-membership-12541713)
**

He told President Zelenskyy: "It's great honour for me. You are my hero. You quit a great acting career for this."

"Not so great as you," he replied.

But Stiller insisted: "What you have done, the way you rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."

The actor spoke of his time visiting the war-torn country, and the devastation he had seen.

"I feel that it's hard to understand what's going on here if you haven't been here.

"We were talking about the actual impact of coming here. I just was in Irpin this morning, saw the level of destruction.

"You see it on TV, you see it on social media, it's something else to actually see it and feel it and then to talk to people. We have talked to a bunch of people."

**.

The pair discussed the difficulties keeping the war in Ukraine in the global public eye after so many months of fighting.

President Zelenskyy said: "It is not interesting to speak about the war every day for an audience, for different people, but for us it is very important.

"When people forget to speak about this influence and how to push Russia, it's very difficult."

Looking at Stiller, he added: "Thanks to people like you, we can do it."

**

As he visited eastern Europe, Stiller has released a video message urging global support for Ukrainian refugees and the 100 million refugees around the world.

In his message he said: "I'm here meeting people who've been impacted by the work and hearing how it's changed their lives.

"War and violence are devastating people all over the world. No one chooses to flee their home. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person."

Last week Stiller, who is a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) goodwill ambassador, had flown to Rzeszow in southeastern Poland.

On Sunday he was also spotted walking in the western city of Lviv, which has come under attack by [**Russian**](https://news.sky.com/topic/russia-5803)
 forces during the months-long invasion but has remained relatively unscathed compared to the ferocious assaults in the east of the country.

On his Instagram page, Stiller said he was meeting families "whose lives have been torn apart by war and violence in [**Ukraine**](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
".

He said millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 90% being women and children, following the invasion by President Vladimir Putin's troops.

Stiller added: "I'm here to learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify calls for solidarity.

"Everyone has the right to seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever."

In one image, he was photographed meeting workers from the UNHCR.

In another post, the Zoolander and Tropic Thunder star was pictured hugging two refugee children near the Medyka border in Poland.

Since the war began, a number of stars from the music and film industries have visited Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.

In April, Hollywood actress and UN humanitarian Angelina Jolie [**made a surprise visit to Lviv**](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-angelina-jolie-seen-in-lviv-amid-russias-invasion-12602639)

### Watch on Deadline

POTUS today said that is “not likely” he will go to Ukraine while in Europe later this week.

Speaking with reporters briefly on a wide range of topics this morning, Biden added that he did not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by swooping into Kyiv as other leaders and celebrities have over the past months. Still, having visited with Ukrainian refugees on a trip to Poland in March, Biden could be planning a surprise touch down in Kyiv as he travels in Germany and Spain in the coming days.

On the other hand, before meeting Zelenskyy on Monday, Stiller walked among the ruins of Irpin and talked to survivors of the Russian attacks. “It’s one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,” said the actor to Zelenskyy later in the duo’s sit-down. “That’s a lot more shocking.”

“What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,” the battle garbed Ukrainian leader told Stiller. “But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east.”

Earlier, Stiller filmed a brief video for social media unveiling his trip, as you can see below:

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is from their meeting on June 20, 2022, as reported by Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878)) and Deadline ([https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/](https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/)). The image is used in a disinformation campaign claiming that Stiller was paid by USAID, which is denied by Stiller, according to Maldita.es ([https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/)).

The Maldita.es article discusses the disinformation campaign and the lack of evidence for USAID payments to celebrities. The Sky News article reports on Stiller's visit to Kyiv and his meeting with Zelenskyy. The Deadline article also covers the meeting, but does not mention Stiller receiving money from USAID. <image:17>, <image:6456>, <image:6457>, <image:6464>, <image:6465>, <image:6466>, <image:6467>, <image:6468>, <image:6469>, <image:6472>, <image:6474>, <image:6475>, <image:6477>, <image:6481>

Stiller was visiting as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. The ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989)) also reported on the meeting.

The BBC source includes the image of the meeting (<image:17>). The ABC News and the New York Post sources do not mention Stiller receiving $4 million from USAID.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Ben Stiller denied claims that he received $4 million from USAID for his trip to Ukraine, stating that he self-funded his humanitarian trip. He met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in June 2022 (<image:17>).

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed that Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Ben Stiller received $4 million from USAID for his meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 20, 2022, is false. Multiple sources confirm the meeting took place, and the image provided is from that meeting. However, Ben Stiller denied receiving any payment from USAID for his trip, stating that he self-funded it. The UNHCR also confirmed that Stiller is not compensated for his work and funds his travel.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

The image of Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is from their meeting on June 20, 2022, as reported by Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878)) and Deadline ([https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/](https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/)). The image is used in a disinformation campaign claiming that Stiller was paid by USAID, which is denied by Stiller, according to Maldita.es ([https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/)).

The Maldita.es article discusses the disinformation campaign and the lack of evidence for USAID payments to celebrities. The Sky News article reports on Stiller's visit to Kyiv and his meeting with Zelenskyy. The Deadline article also covers the meeting, but does not mention Stiller receiving money from USAID. <image:17>, <image:6456>, <image:6457>, <image:6464>, <image:6465>, <image:6466>, <image:6467>, <image:6468>, <image:6469>, <image:6472>, <image:6474>, <image:6475>, <image:6477>, <image:6481>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351)) and the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/](https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/)) reported that Ben Stiller met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 20, 2022, in Kyiv. Stiller was visiting as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. The ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989)) also reported on the meeting.

The BBC source includes the image of the meeting (<image:17>). The ABC News and the New York Post sources do not mention Stiller receiving $4 million from USAID.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Ben Stiller denied claims that he received $4 million from USAID for his trip to Ukraine, stating that he self-funded his humanitarian trip. He met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in June 2022 (<image:17>).

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed that Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel.

## Elaboration
The claim that Ben Stiller received $4 million from USAID for his meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 20, 2022, is false. Multiple sources confirm the meeting took place, and the image provided is from that meeting. However, Ben Stiller denied receiving any payment from USAID for his trip, stating that he self-funded it. The UNHCR also confirmed that Stiller is not compensated for his work and funds his travel.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. While the image and meeting date are accurate, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is refuted by Stiller himself and the UNHCR. `false`

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

He told us this is “an obvious—and not particularly well-executed—fake”...

In a wide-ranging conversation on [Theo Von's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts and outlets have been spreading a [baseless narrative](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
 that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down [in the Los Angeles wildfires](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

[!Russian navy recruits perform with the Russian flag in St. <image:2336>](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

### LA fires are still raging, but forecasters expect calmer winds in the coming days

[It was another day of fierce winds gusting to 65 mph in mountainous areas of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, but weather more conducive to firefighting operations is expected soon.](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

### This is what Russian propaganda looks like in 2024

[The hallmarks of Russian-back influence are consistent: trying to erode support for Ukraine, discrediting democratic institutions and seizing on existing political divides.](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. 

**Transcript:**

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia. So this particular narrative, what it alleges is that mansions of eight Ukrainian generals were amongst the homes destroyed."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine
================================================================

21 July 2023

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday."

Since the Independence of [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")
 following the collapse of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

After the start of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")
, when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)
 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. The FBI memorialized Smirnov's lies in an [FD-1023 form](/wiki/List_of_FBI_forms#FD-1023 "List of FBI forms")
, which read in part:

> Zlochevsky said he had a total of "17 recordings" involving the Bidens; two of the recordings included Joe Biden, and the remaining 15 recordings only included Hunter Biden. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)
> [\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."[\[35\]](#cite_note-Whitehurst_Mascaro_2/15/2024-35)

The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled [House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family](/wiki/United_States_House_Oversight_Committee_investigation_into_the_Biden_family "United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family")
 in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services"."

Prosecutors and the defence have agreed to recommend a sentence of between four and six years in prison when he is sentenced next month.

Smirnov, 44, was [arrested in February](/news/2024/2/16/fbi-informant-charged-with-lying-in-bidens-ukraine-bribe-claims)
 on charges of making a “false statement” and “creating a false and fictitious record” to his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter Biden $5m each around 2015.

Smirnov made the politically charged allegations in June 2020, after “expressing bias” about Joe Biden when he was running for president, prosecutors said.

In fact, Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017, according to court documents.

The FBI found no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes as US president or in his previous office as vice president.

While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment, his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House impeachment inquiry into Biden.

Before Smirnov’s arrest, Republicans had demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were true.

During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also claimed the Russians probably had recordings of [Hunter Biden](/news/2023/6/30/hunter-biden-the-us-presidents-scandal-plagued-son)
 because a hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was “wired” and under their control — information he said was passed along to him by four high-level Russian officials.

But Hunter Biden had never travelled to Ukraine, according to Smirnov’s indictment.

Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that “officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story” about Hunter Biden.

“Despite repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information to the FBI and that he must not fabricate evidence, the defendant provided false derogatory information” about the Bidens, prosecutors said in the indictment filed in federal court.

Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial in a gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in a separate tax case. But he was [pardoned this month](/news/2024/12/2/joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters)
 by his father, who said he believed “raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that investigations into alleged bribery schemes involving Joe Biden and Ukraine have found no evidence of wrongdoing. Specifically, the BBC News and Al Jazeera articles state that investigations by the FBI found no evidence to support claims of bribes. The Wikipedia article also mentions the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, but it also states that no evidence of wrongdoing was found.

The claim that the image shows an authentic list released by Ukraine detailing bribes is not supported by the evidence. The search results focus on investigations and conspiracy theories, but they do not mention any official list released by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.

The article is available at [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217). The Wikipedia article discusses the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden took a bribe, but a joint investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. The article is available at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory).

Al Jazeera published an article on December 16, 2024, stating that a former FBI informant pleaded guilty to lying about a bribery scheme involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The FBI found no evidence of corruption or bribes. The article is available at [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/16/former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-phony-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/16/former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-phony-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens). <image:1>, <image:10075>, <image:10077>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that investigations into alleged bribery schemes involving Joe Biden and Ukraine have found no evidence of wrongdoing. Specifically, the BBC News and Al Jazeera articles state that investigations by the FBI found no evidence to support claims of bribes. The Wikipedia article also mentions the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, but it also states that no evidence of wrongdoing was found.

The claim that the image shows an authentic list released by Ukraine detailing bribes is not supported by the evidence. The search results focus on investigations and conspiracy theories, but they do not mention any official list released by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Full form | Short form | Diminutive form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Cyrillic/Latin) |     |     |

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

Arthur Novosiltsev / Moskva News Agency

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia, with surging government spending on the war continuing to provide a powerful economic stimulus for the country.

The IMF also slashed its outlook for Ukraine, whose economy and infrastructure have been battered by two and a half years of conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine are spending huge sums to continue fighting in the war, with Moscow's state expenditures having helped the economy grow strongly despite a barrage of Western sanctions.

According to its latest forecast, the IMF said it expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 3.2%. But it also cut its prediction for next year's growth from 1.5% to 1.3% amid signs of mounting economic problems.

Russia's Central Bank has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the government's military spending, saying the economy has been “overheating” for months. High inflation — 8.6% in September — and intense labor shortages are also posing economic headaches for Moscow.

In a rare move, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged earlier this month that Russia's record low unemployment of 2.4% was a “limiting factor” for the country's growth prospects.

Russia's Central Bank has raised interest rates to 19% in a bid to bring inflation under control, and it could increase them again at a meeting this coming Friday.

Russia's Finance Ministry, meanwhile, proposed raising military spending next year by almost 30% to around $145 billion, with combined defense and security spending set to account for approximately 40% of state expenditures.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (<image:4533>). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF raised its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (<image:4535>). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed global growth. The IMF also raised its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, I need information from the World Economic Outlook or other IMF publications from October 2024 that rank the world's largest economies.

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. The IMF’s latest [World Economic Outlook](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2025/update/january/english/text.ashx "(opens in a new window)")
 foresees Russia’s economic growth slowing down to 1.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, but it is still expected to grow. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)

.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)

 on Jan. With more than 20% of manufacturing companies paying interest costs exceeding two-thirds of their pre-tax profits at the end of 2024, compared to just 10% a year earlier, Russia should brace for a further “large-scale jump in corporate bankruptcies,” according to a report prepared by Russia’s pro-government [Center For Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting](http://www.forecast.ru/_ARCHIVE/Analitics/DB/2025_01_21eco.pdf)

The evidence indicates that the IMF ranked Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This information comes from a source discussing Russia's economy.

The claim is therefore partially verified. The IMF did rank Russia as the fourth-largest economy, but the evidence does not specify the exact month when this ranking was published.

 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана.

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

![Зеленым цветом обозначены освобожденные территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20703'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)
 soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, German tanks with German crews were captured, a NATO biolab was found under Mariupol, all with no evidence," Cusumano told _Newsweek_.

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Some NATO troops will also attend Friday's commemoration of the defeat of the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw.

A large military parade will take place in Warsaw on Friday to commemorate Poland's victory there against the Red Army in 1920.

The celebrations will be attended by nearly 4,000 Polish soldiers as well as almost 200 army representatives from allied countries including the US and the UK.

The events to mark Polish Army Day will include a wreath-laying ceremony led by Poland's President Karol Nawrocki and his wife Marta.

For the first time, a naval parade in the Baltic Sea will also be held, with 20 ships as well as hydrographic and rescue vessels appearing in the waters around Hel.

**Great show of force in Warsaw and on the Baltic**
---------------------------------------------------

The main highlight of the celebrations, however, will be the military parade on Warsaw's Wisłostrada, which will begin at midday.

"We will be showing the most modern equipment at the disposal of the Polish Armed Forces," spokesperson for the General Staff of the Polish Army Colonel Joanna Klejszmit told Euronews.

Tanks as well as lighter vehicles will be used in the procession, she added.

F-16 aircraft and AH-64 Apache helicopters will also be on display, as will Himars rocket launchers, according to Poland's defence ministry.

The airshow will feature the Australian Army's E-7A Wedgetail early-warning aircraft.

"We will be joined for the first time ever by soldiers from Australia. They are stationed in Poland with their early reconnaissance aircraft, so there will really be something to see," said Colonel Klejszmit.

During the dress rehearsal, Deputy Prime Minister Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasised the special role of France, recalling that the support of French commanders was crucial to the Polish victory at the Battle of Warsaw.

"This is special, because the Battle of Warsaw also with the participation of French troops, the support of French generals, commanders, could have been victorious, so we will thank our allies as well," Kosiniak-Kamysz explained.

The two events — the parade and the naval parade — will start at the same time and will be broadcast live.

In an interview with Euronews, Lieutenant Colonel Michał Tomczyk said interest in the military is growing year on year, especially given the current security concerns in Europe over Russia's all-out war in Ukraine.

He noted that 15 August is the time when many people express their desire to join the army.

"In fact, every garrison in Poland organises its Polish Army Day. There, there will be an opportunity to talk to military personnel and ask about recruitment or particular training courses," he said.

On Saturday, the celebrations will continue with the ceremonial opening of the Museum of the Battle of Warsaw 1920 in Ossów.

Poland currently spends over 4% of its GDP on defence and, with 216,100 military personnel, has the third largest army in NATO.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO member Poland paid tribute Thursday to its historic 1920 victory over the Red Army by honoring fallen Poles and showing off modern tanks and other equipment that it hopes will deter [the threat it sees in modern-day Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-self-defense-security-ukraine-russia-war-06569fdb6f4792fd0b919a24e1d6bef1)
.

More than 2,500 Polish troops, joined by dozens of U.S. Since Poland broke free of Moscow’s control starting in 1989 and then joined NATO, it has worked to modernize its army.

Those efforts moved into higher gear after Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, first invaded parts of Ukraine in 2014, and then began its full-fledged assault in 2022, with fears heightened all along the strategic stretch of NATO’s eastern flank — from the Baltic nations to Poland to Romania.
