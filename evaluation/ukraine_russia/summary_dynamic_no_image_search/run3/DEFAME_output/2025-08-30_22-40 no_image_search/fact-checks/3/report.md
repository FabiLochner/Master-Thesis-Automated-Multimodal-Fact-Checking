## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 2](media/3.jpg))
web_search("The Economist cover Trump Putin apocalypse")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of the "Apocalypse" cover featuring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is an altered cover and was not published by The Economist. PesaCheck.org states that the original cover is from March 16, 2024. The DW article mentions that the cover is fabricated and a case of "media spoofing." Ukrinform states that the image is a fake cover created by Russian propagandists and lacks a publication date. The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, depicted a globe being struck by a golf club. The next issue, scheduled for November 23, 2024, will focus on Elon Musk.
