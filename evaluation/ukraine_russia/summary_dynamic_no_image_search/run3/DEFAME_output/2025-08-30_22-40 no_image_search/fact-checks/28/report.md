## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The letter expressed Wałęsa's "horror" at Trump's argument with Zelenskyy. The letter was also signed by dozens of former Polish political prisoners.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but it lacks specific information about the military aid suspension.

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025 criticizing his behavior toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The initial search did not provide information about the specific content of the letter regarding military aid. A second search was performed, but no new evidence was found.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking Wałęsa's letter to the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025 criticizing his treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The claim is partially supported, but it lacks specific information about the military aid suspension.

Since the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking Wałęsa's letter to the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.
