Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that the war would cost Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The search result from Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses in the war with Ukraine. The last update of the Probate Registry estimate was February 24, 2025, with an estimate as of December 2024. The article mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, a Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, reports over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)). Additionally, a Wikipedia article mentions that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously considered missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
