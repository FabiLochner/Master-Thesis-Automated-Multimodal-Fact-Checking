## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, articles from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html)) reported on Elon Musk's statements regarding X's "Community Notes" feature and his criticism of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Musk claimed the feature was being manipulated and questioned the credibility of polls showing high support for Zelenskyy.

Musk stated he would "fix" the Community Notes feature, without providing evidence. An article from Northeastern University ([https://cssh.northeastern.edu/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelensky/](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelensky/)) also reported on Musk's pledge to fix X's fact-checking tool. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in February 2025, Elon Musk made statements about X's "Community Notes" feature and expressed criticism of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Musk to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.

The articles from Al Jazeera, CNBC, and Northeastern University focus on Musk's concerns about the manipulation of the "Community Notes" feature and his skepticism regarding polls showing support for Zelenskyy.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that in February 2025, Elon Musk made statements about X's "Community Notes" feature and expressed criticism of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Musk to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.

Since the provided evidence does not support the claim that Elon Musk planned to suspend Volodymyr Zelenskyy's X account, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
In February 2025, Elon Musk discussed X's "Community Notes" feature and expressed skepticism about polls related to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as reported by Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html)). However, there is no evidence from these or other sources to support the claim that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.
