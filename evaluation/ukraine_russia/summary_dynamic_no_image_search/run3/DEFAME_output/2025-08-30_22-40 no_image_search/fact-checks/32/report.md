PBS News ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-harris-meets-with-ukraines-zelenskyy-as-russia-makes-nuclear-warning)) reports on Kamala Harris's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where she criticized suggestions that Ukraine should cede territory for peace with Moscow. The Brookings article ([Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-trump-and-harris-handle-the-russia-ukraine-war/)) discusses how Harris would handle the Russia-Ukraine war, mentioning her commitment to supporting Ukraine. ![image 2002](media/2025-08-07_19-31-1754595091-239131.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia. The IMDb.com source ([Source](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)) provides a quote attributed to her that includes the phrases "Ukraine is a country in Europe," "Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine," "It exists next to another country called Russia," "Russia is a bigger country," and "Russia is a powerful country."

The evidence does not include the phrase "So basically that's wrong." Therefore, the claim is partially supported.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia, including the phrases in the claim. However, the evidence does not include the phrase "So basically that's wrong."

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially accurate. Kamala Harris did say, "Ukraine is a country in Europe. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country," as evidenced by IMDb.com ([Source](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)). However, the claim also includes the phrase "So basically that's wrong," which is not found in the provided evidence.
