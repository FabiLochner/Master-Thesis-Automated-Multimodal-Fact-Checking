The article states that Trump claimed Zelenskyy "talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion," which DW Factcheck labels as "Unproven."

The article also mentions that a significant part of the aid consists of paying U.S. soldiers to train Ukrainian troops and sending weapons and military equipment. The article was edited by Rachel Baig.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-us-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous): 
Content: An AP News article from February 1, 2025, reports on an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy stated that excluding Ukraine from talks between the U.S. and Russia about the war would be "very dangerous." <image:9598> The article does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Zelenskyy did give an interview to AP News on February 1, 2025, the provided article does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Other sources indicate that Zelenskyy stated Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in U.S. aid in an interview with the Associated Press on February 2, 2025, but this does not confirm the claim that the aid is a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
