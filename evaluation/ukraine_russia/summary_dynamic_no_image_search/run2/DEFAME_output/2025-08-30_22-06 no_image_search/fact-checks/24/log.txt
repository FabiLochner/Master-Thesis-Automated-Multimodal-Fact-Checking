The claim 'Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.' is false.
Justification: While the claim is partially correct in that over $500 million has been donated to Ukraine since 2022, the donations were made by the Howard Buffett Foundation, led by Warren Buffett's son, not Warren Buffett himself. Sources like [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/) and [Alliance magazine](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/) confirm the foundation's significant contributions.

So, the overall veracity is: false
