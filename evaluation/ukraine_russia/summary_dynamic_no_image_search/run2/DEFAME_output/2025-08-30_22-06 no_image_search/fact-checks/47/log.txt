Content: The search result from without-lie.info states that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake.

Content: The search result from Myth Detector, published on April 8, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin. <image:9642>. The article states that the magazine did not publish an issue on March 20, 2025, the date on the fake cover, and that the issue number (1705) matches the one published on March 26. The article also mentions that the fake cover was shared on social media and that similar forgeries have been used in Russian disinformation campaigns.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.africanews.com/2025/05/06/fake-charlie-hebdo-cover-shows-zelenskyy-exploiting-popes-death-for-cash//): 
Content: The Africanews website published an article on May 6, 2025, about a fake Charlie Hebdo cover that mocks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Pope Francis. <image:9648> The article states that the image is not authentic and provides evidence, including the correct edition number and content of the real Charlie Hebdo issue from April 23, 2025. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo has previously warned about the use of fake covers by pro-Russian actors.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The image is a fabricated Charlie Hebdo cover. Multiple sources, including [without-lie.info](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/), confirm that the cover is not authentic, and the date and issue number do not correspond to actual publications.

So, the overall veracity is: false
