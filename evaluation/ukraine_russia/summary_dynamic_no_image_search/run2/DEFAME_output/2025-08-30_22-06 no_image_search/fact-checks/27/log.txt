Content: The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a home in Florida, private planes, and has a monthly income of $11 million is false. Fact-checks from sources like Snopes ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html)) and others show that Zelenskyy's declared assets and income are significantly lower. His real estate holdings are worth around $4 million, and his net worth is approximately $1.5 million, with a monthly income of $930.
