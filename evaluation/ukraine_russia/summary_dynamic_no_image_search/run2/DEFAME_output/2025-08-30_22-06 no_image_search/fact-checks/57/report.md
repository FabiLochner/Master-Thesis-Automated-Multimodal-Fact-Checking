## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A video of Donald Trump criticizing Keir Starmer is circulating, but the audio is AI-generated and overlaid onto a video interview Trump did with Theo Von on August 21, 2024, according to the University of California, Berkeley ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)). The original interview did not discuss the UK or Ukraine.

Yahoo News mentions that Theo Von had Donald Trump on his podcast last year ([https://uk.news.yahoo.com/podcast-bro-theo-von-questions-224125941.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/podcast-bro-theo-von-questions-224125941.html)). Five Minute News has episodes related to Donald Trump from August 2024, but none mention an interview with Theo Von or Keir Starmer ([https://fiveminute.news/cheer/episodes](https://fiveminute.news/cheer/episodes)). ![image 5130](media/2025-08-29_08-05-1756454745-386994.jpg), ![image 5131](media/2025-08-29_08-05-1756454748-680982.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. A video of Trump criticizing Keir Starmer is circulating, but the audio is AI-generated and overlaid onto a video interview Trump did with Theo Von on August 21, 2024 ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)). The original interview did not discuss the UK or Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. While Donald Trump did have an interview with Theo Von in August 2024, the audio criticizing Keir Starmer was AI-generated and overlaid onto the original interview. The original interview did not discuss the UK or Ukraine.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE
