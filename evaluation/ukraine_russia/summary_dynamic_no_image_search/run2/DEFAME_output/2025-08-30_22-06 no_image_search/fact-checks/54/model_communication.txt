Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Shortfalls in required monitoring by American officials mean the U.S. cannot track more than $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to [Ukraine to fight invading Russian forces](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-lithuania-estonia-latvia-22ee93052cc1a6f21ea5ab586f42a3de)
, according to a Pentagon audit released Thursday.

The findings mean that 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear that the U.S. has provided Ukraine and was directed to guard against misuse or theft remained “delinquent,” the report by the Defense Department’s office of the inspector-general, the watchdog body for the Pentagon, said.

While Biden administration officials stressed Thursday that there was no evidence the weapons had been stolen, the audit undermines two years of lavish assurances from the administration that rigorous monitoring would keep U.S. The audit findings are likely to make Biden’s task even harder.

House Republican opposition for months has stalled Biden’s request to Congress [for $105 billion more](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ukraine-israel-budget-3762a0bdf00653e3c8a38175d3c3d3cb)
 for Ukraine, Israel and other national security objectives. The end-use monitoring was required for gear that had sensitive technology and was smaller, making it more vulnerable to arms trafficking.

The Pentagon inspector general’s report said that the Defense Department had failed to maintain an accurate serial-number inventory of those defense articles for Ukraine as required.

Reasons for the shortfall in monitoring included limited staffing; the fact that procedures for carrying out end-use monitoring in a war zone weren’t put in place until December 2022; restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine; and a lack of internal controls on inventory, the report said.

While the U.S. had improved monitoring since the first year of the war, “significant personnel limitations and accountability challenges remain,” auditors said; full accounting of the gear was impossible as long as those shortfalls remained, they said.

Kirby said administration officials “has for many months now been interested in improving accountability over the end use of material that is provided to Ukraine.”

The audit didn’t attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. It noted the Defense Department inspector-general’s office now had people stationed in Ukraine, and that its criminal investigators were still looking into allegations of criminal misuse of the security assistance.

Defense Department officials told auditors they expected to have systems for improved oversight in place this year and next.

From [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/): 
Content: "Storch announced today that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released the “Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine.” This audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies.

“Robust internal controls are the backbone for efficiency and accountability,” said IG Storch. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Inspector General Robert P. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose."

Verification within Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program

A video report, supposedly from The Wall Street Journal, is being [circulated](https://t.me/sheyhtamir1974/94005)
 online claiming that the U.S. Department of Defense is demanding that Kyiv conduct a full audit of all American weapons supplied to Ukraine. This demand is alleged to be due to the anticipated reduction or even complete cessation of arms supplies to Ukraine following Donald Trump’s potential victory in the presidential elections.

**However, this is a fake. Department of Defense’s [website](https://www.defense.gov/News/?Page=5)
 does not mention any requirement for Ukraine to conduct such an audit.

Furthermore, all quotes attributed to The Wall Street Journal’s national security and intelligence correspondent, [Warren Strobel](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/warren-p-strobel)
, are fabricated — he has not written about any audit in his articles or on [social media](https://twitter.com/wstrobel)
. On June 18, 2024, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a [report](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smoke-on-the-horizon-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-conflict-in-Ukraine-GI-TOC-June-2024.v3.pdf)
 on arms market trends in the context of Russian aggression. It stated that while any war carries the risk of increased international arms trade, Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to prevent these risks and has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures. The report notes that arms control is one of the state’s priorities.

The narrative that military aid to Ukraine ends up in the hands of terrorists and criminal groups is primarily aimed at a Western audience. Additionally, there is no [information](https://archive.ph/zkuGs)
 online about a supposed 20-day Pentagon deadline for a weapons audit. WSJ colleagues would not have made such an error.

Warren Strobel has also not written about the risk of weapons supplied to Ukraine ending up on the black market."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments in 2024 surged 29% to a record $318.7 billion, the State Department said on Friday, as countries sought to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine and prepare for major conflicts.

The figures from the Biden administration's final year underpin expectations of stronger sales for U.S. [Trump wants](/world/us/trump-says-not-sure-us-should-be-spending-anything-nato-2025-01-23/)
 other members of NATO to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense – a huge increase from the current 2% goal and a level that no NATO country, including the United States, currently reaches.

Defense contractors are straining to meet the surge of demand that has mushroomed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. is seeking to replenish stockpiles of weaponry and munitions sent to Kyiv.

Arms sales and transfers are viewed as "important U.S. weapons makers, which are expecting that orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, hundreds of Patriot missile interceptors, and a surge in orders for armored vehicles will underpin their results in coming quarters.

There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. arms trade and defense industry. Mike also spends a lot of his time writing on Ukraine and how industry has adapted, or faltered as it supports that conflict. Before his time in Washington Mike’s coverage focused on mergers and acquisitions for oil and gas companies, financial institutions, defense companies, consumer product makers, retailers, real estate giants, and telecommunications companies.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

The Trump administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine, providing a potentially powerful tool to Kyiv as it continues to face a [relentless assault by Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-attack-hnk-intl)
.

The announcement of the proposed $825 million sale Thursday comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have yet to yield a result and following a deadly night of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital.

It was announced after President Donald Trump met this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin and separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Although the Trump administration has approved a number of sales of equipment to sustain existing weapons, this appears to be the first major arms sale of new weapons to Ukraine announced by the administration.

A source familiar said that if the sale is concluded as expected, the missiles – which have a range of 150-280 miles – could be delivered later this year.

It is unclear whether there will be restrictions on their use.

“Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase,” the notice from the State Department said. “The ERAM is an example of working together with our NATO allies to develop a capable and scalable system capable of being delivered on a fast timeline.”

“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,” it said.

## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine US arms sales corruption")
web_search("Ukraine arms sales audit")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

 the homes and offices of arms dealers across the country Tuesday as part of a corruption investigation launched by Ukraine, officials said.

The raids, carried out in multiple regions including Sofia, followed a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is probing alleged overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv.

Acting Interior Ministry Secretary General Miroslav Rashkov said no arrests had been made and that the searches were being conducted under the supervision of the National Investigation Service. Bulgaria Raids Arms Dealers in Ukraine-Led Corruption Probe

Law enforcement teams search homes and offices in multiple cities at Kyiv’s request, but no arrests have been made so far.

Raids were conducted in several areas, including Sofia, in response to a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating suspected overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv. Many deliveries are routed through intermediaries before reaching Ukrainian buyers, a process now under scrutiny in several countries.

Rashkov said the operation remained underway Tuesday afternoon and declined to speculate on possible arrests or charges.

The Supreme Prosecution Office of Cassation said it was overseeing the searches, which form part of an international effort to combat corruption and abuse in the arms trade. Bulgarian officials have not named the targets of the raids or confirmed whether any evidence has been found.

Ukrainian investigators allege certain intermediaries, including foreign-based arms dealers, profited from wartime defense contracts by inflating prices. It is unclear whether any seized materials will be shared directly with Ukrainian authorities.

Bulgaria is a producer and transit hub for weapons supplied to Ukraine, with exports surging since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

The illicit nature of banned weapons and the potential for weaponry theft and circulation on the black market raise genuine concerns about the security of arms sales to Ukraine.

 for arms in Europe, with around 300,000 small arms and light weapons reported lost or stolen during the Russian invasion of Crimea between 2013 and 2015. This number is small compared to the estimated US$32 billion [lost](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 in Ukrainian military equipment stolen and sold on the black market between 1992 and 1998. Facts or False Alarms: The State of Illicit Arms in Ukraine
===========================================================

19.Jun.2024 . These two problems, which continue to plague lawmakers in Washington, have been exacerbated by the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine.

### The Illegal Movement of Weapons

_Weaponry Theft in Ukraine: Reality or Russian Disinformation?_

The invasion of Ukraine has [led](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 to a larger quantity of weapons entering Europe, and thus a greater possibility for weapons to go missing. Since 2022, there have been sporadic [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/pentagon-watchdog-report-ukraine-weaponry/index.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 of small and large arms being stolen in Ukraine. Although it is difficult to confirm when and where weapons are stolen, the sheer scale of [weapon transfers](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 means that it is highly likely that some weapons will go missing over the course of the conflict.

However, when examining the extent to which illicit weapons are being used or sold in Ukraine, it is important to acknowledge the massive amount of Russian [disinformation](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4403926-pentagon-watchdog-ukraine-military-aid/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 about these weapons. Reports about Finnish gangsters, French rioters, Nigerian fighters, and Mexican cartels gaining weapons—like rifles and grenade launchers—from Ukraine have all been [debunked](https://riskbulletins.globalinitiative.net/ukr-obs-001/01-monitoring-illicit-arms-flows-from-the-conflict-in-ukraine.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 as Russian propaganda attempting to sway the United States and NATO allies to decrease arms transfers. The current US end-use monitoring program [focuses](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems and Anti-Tank/All-purpose Tactical Guided Missiles because of the classified information used to build those weapons. Contrarily, monitoring efforts have paid little attention to small arms and light weapons, yet those are the weapons more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations in Ukraine."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Harvard International Review (June 19, 2024) discusses the illicit arms trade in Ukraine, highlighting concerns about weapons theft and circulation on the black market. It mentions Ukraine's history of a large black market for arms, with an estimated $32 billion in military equipment lost between 1992 and 1998. The article notes reports of weapons being stolen since 2022, but also warns about Russian disinformation campaigns exaggerating the issue. The US end-use monitoring program focuses on specific weapon systems, with less attention on small arms and light weapons, which are more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

Content: "(Prices for AK weapons – a useful barometer – have fallen in Ukraine this year, from around US$1 000–1 500 in 2023 to US$1 000, according to GI-TOC sources.) The US-made M240 machine gun was offered for sale at US$8 000 and a Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher at US$6 000 – expensive, but a bargain for interested criminals, given the capabilities of such weapons. 

Elsewhere, there are signs that the arms trafficking market is becoming more organized, with larger stockpiles being assembled. ![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments."

### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]).

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

Content: The Harvard International Review (June 19, 2024) discusses the illicit arms trade in Ukraine, highlighting concerns about weapons theft and circulation on the black market. It mentions Ukraine's history of a large black market for arms, with an estimated $32 billion in military equipment lost between 1992 and 1998. The article notes reports of weapons being stolen since 2022, but also warns about Russian disinformation campaigns exaggerating the issue. The US end-use monitoring program focuses on specific weapon systems, with less attention on small arms and light weapons, which are more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

Houthi attacks on commercial vessels
------------------------------------

Main article: [Houthi attacks on commercial vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")

Houthi forces began attacking shipping vessels affiliated with [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 passing through the Red Sea on 19 November 2023. The video game's developers, [Bohemia Interactive](/wiki/Bohemia_Interactive "Bohemia Interactive")
, said that action taken against the videos was ineffective, saying: "With every video flagged, debunked, or taken down, ten more can be uploaded each day."[\[122\]](#cite_note-cbsnews20240605-130)
 Footage from the video game has also been misrepresented as attacks on shipping[\[128\]](#cite_note-136)
 and a US fighter jet being shot down by the Houthis over Sanaa.[\[129\]](#cite_note-137)

### Foreign involvement

Since 2014, the Houthis, who oppose [Yemen's internationally recognized government](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
, have controlled a considerable swath of the country's territory along the Red Sea. The sources also stated that Iran has escalated its provision of advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, since the outbreak of the Gaza war.[\[3\]](#cite_note-hez-4)

US officials told _[Semafor](/wiki/Semafor_(website) "Semafor (website)")
_ that commanders and advisors from Iran's [Revolutionary Guards](/wiki/Revolutionary_Guards "Revolutionary Guards")
 are currently stationed in Yemen, and are directly involved in the Houthi attacks on commercial traffic in the Red Sea. The [Qods Force](/wiki/Qods_Force "Qods Force")
, has overseen the transfer of the attack drones, cruise missiles, and medium-range ballistic missiles which have been used in the strikes on Red Sea and Israeli targets in recent weeks.[\[1\]](#cite_note-semafor-2)

According to Western intelligence officials, the Iranian [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps")
 placed an intelligence gathering ship to guide Houthi attacks on ships that switch off radios and identifiers.[\[130\]](#cite_note-138)
 According to the Institute for the Study of War, this was likely [MV _Behshad_](/wiki/MV_Behshad "MV Behshad")

In July 2024, the [Defense Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency "Defense Intelligence Agency")
 reported that the Houthis used an Iranian-made missile in their attack on the Norwegian-flagged _Strinda_ on 11 December 2023. The officials did not elaborate on how Iran was helping the Houthis, but Michael Knights of the American think tank [Washington Institute for Near East Policy](/wiki/The_Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy "The Washington Institute for Near East Policy")
 said the Houthis received Iranian surface-to-air missiles, such as the [358](/wiki/358_missile "358 missile")
 and [SA-2](/wiki/S-75_Dvina "S-75 Dvina")
, that allowed them to improve their air defenses and target US drones.[\[135\]](#cite_note-143)

#### North Korea

[Voice of America](/wiki/Voice_of_America "Voice of America")

From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/us/drone-sightings-east-coast): 
Content: "The flying objects have been spotted over residential neighborhoods, restricted sites and critical infrastructure.

The sightings have put intense pressure on [federal agencies](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/politics/mysterious-drone-sightings-lawmakers-criticize-response/index.html)
 to provide more information about the aircraft, as officials have urged calm and emphasized there is no evidence suggesting the sightings pose a security threat.

The Biden administration has not identified “anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risks over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the Northeast,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday.

“We assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircrafts, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,” Kirby said. [](#maincontent)

Video Ad Feedback

Are drones spotted over NJ dangerous? And calls for military intervention.

This isn’t the plot of “War of the Worlds,” but rather the result of numerous possible drone sightings in recent weeks. While the FBI is still checking out 100 or so tips, none of them appear nefarious, he said.

“I can’t rule out the fact that we might find some sort of illegal or criminal activity, some nefarious activity, (but) all I can do is tell you that right now we see none of that,” Kirby said.

The US is sending drone detection and tracking systems to two military facilities in New Jersey, according to three defense officials Monday. The systems are in the process of moving to Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, in northern New Jersey and Naval Weapons Station Earle in central New Jersey, the officials said.

Drones have been spotted near [Picatinny Arsenal](https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1866933937467166857)
 and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to [military officials](https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1866933937467166857)
 and [state lawmakers](https://x.com/SenBooker/status/1866607594837848396/photo/1)
. The sightings prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.

“Several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” were also reported above [Naval Weapons Station Earle](https://cnrma.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NWS-Earle/)
, a US Navy base south of Middletown, although no direct threats were identified.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy received a briefing from the FBI on Sunday night regarding the drone sighting investigation around Naval Weapons Station Earle, he said in [a post on X](https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1868499153153855491)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:20>)
reverse_search(<image:20>)
web_search("drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones, with the Houthis claiming to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The article mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR reports that Houthi rebels have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen) The Wikipedia article discusses the Red Sea crisis, which began in October 2023, and mentions the Houthis launching attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and receiving retaliatory strikes from the US and allies. The Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs. The article also mentions the US Navy shooting down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis) <image:9764>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The NPR article states that the Houthis have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. The Wikipedia article mentions that the Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs.

The image's location is most likely in Israel. The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the type of aircraft involved.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the Houthis have shot down US drones. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Okay, next job. NATO has carefully studied the conflict even before the Blue Helmets force surge and sent several drones to recon. Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. Find their impact locations and bring me the memory disks. Open up the panels to retrieve the disks

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:20>)
reverse_search(<image:20>)
web_search("drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones, with the Houthis claiming to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The article mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR reports that Houthi rebels have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen) The Wikipedia article discusses the Red Sea crisis, which began in October 2023, and mentions the Houthis launching attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and receiving retaliatory strikes from the US and allies. The Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs. The article also mentions the US Navy shooting down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis) <image:9764>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The NPR article states that the Houthis have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. The Wikipedia article mentions that the Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs.

The image's location is most likely in Israel. The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the type of aircraft involved.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the Houthis have shot down US drones. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun offered condolences to the soldiers who were killed and injured, stressing that the military “is paying, in blood, the price of preserving stability in the south” of the country.

The deadly incident came as Israel has been carrying out near-daily attacks on Lebanon despite [a ceasefire reached](/news/2024/11/26/ceasefire-between-lebanons-hezbollah-and-israel-what-to-know)
 with Hezbollah in November.

It also coincides with a United Nations Security Council vote to wind down a UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has for decades been tasked with maintaining a buffer between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces.

The [mandate](/news/2025/8/28/un-security-council-renews-unifil-mission-in-lebanon-until-end-of-2026)
 for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was extended through the end of 2026, but after that, the UN will carry out an “orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal” over the following year.

The resolution aims to make Lebanon’s military “the sole provider of security” in southern Lebanon, a goal complicated by Israel’s continued presence in the country. Both Israel and its top ally, the United States, have been pushing to end the UNIFIL mission.

“The process of withdrawing its 10,800 military and civilian personnel and equipment would start immediately in consultation with the Lebanese government, to be completed within a year,” Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr explained.

The US has also been pressuring Lebanon’s government to agree to a plan to disarm Hezbollah – something the Lebanese group has rejected, stressing that such a move will only reward Israel.

On a visit to Beirut on Tuesday, US envoy [Tom Barrack](/news/2025/8/28/us-envoy-says-calling-lebanon-reporters-animalistic-was-inappropriate)
 said Lebanon had agreed to present a plan aimed at persuading Hezbollah to disarm while Israel would submit a corresponding framework for its military withdrawal from the country.

Barrack said the plan, which is expected to be presented on Sunday, will not involve military coercion but focus on efforts to encourage Hezbollah to surrender its weapons.

A day earlier, Hezbollah Secretary-General [Naim Qassem said](/news/2025/8/25/hezbollah-chief-rejects-disarmament-demands-israel-comply-with-ceasefire)
 the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the ceasefire before talks on a national defence strategy could take place.

“If you truly want sovereignty, then stop the aggression."

In an apparent first, an Israeli Air Force drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran overnight, the Israeli military and Iranian media said.

Footage broadcast by Iran’s state broadcaster IRIB on Wednesday morning showed what appeared to be a crashed Israeli Air Force Hermes 900.

“During operational activity, a surface-to-air missile was launched at an air force unmanned aerial vehicle,” the Israel Defense Forces said later, confirming the drone crashed in Iran.

The IDF said that “there is no fear of information leaking.”

The IAF has been operating over Iran, at a distance of more than 1,500 kilometers from Israel, since early Friday.

The military says it has air supremacy over western Iran and Tehran, and is working to extend it to other parts of the country, to thwart Iranian ballistic missile attacks on Israel.

More than 70 Iranian air defense batteries have been destroyed in strikes so far, according to the IDF.

> Video of wreckage of an Isralei Hermes drone shot down by the Iranian air defense in the Isfahan province this morning. We are constantly engaged in the struggle to maintain air superiority,” the military said.

The IDF said the incident over Isfahan was being investigated further.

The military has denied previous Iranian claims of shooting down Israeli aircraft, which were not backed by any evidence.

Several Hermes drones were [downed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-downs-idf-drone-over-south-lebanon-fires-heavy-rockets-at-north/)
 during the war with Iran’s proxy Hezbollah terror group.

Now in its sixth day, the Israeli operation in Iran was launched Friday with the objective of removing the “existential threat” of the Iranian nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities.

Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran’s top military leaders, nuclear scientists, uranium enrichment sites, and ballistic missile program is necessary to prevent the Islamic Republic from realizing its avowed plan to destroy the Jewish state.

Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones, with the Houthis claiming to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The article mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR reports that Houthi rebels have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen) The Wikipedia article discusses the Red Sea crisis, which began in October 2023, and mentions the Houthis launching attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and receiving retaliatory strikes from the US and allies. The Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs. The article also mentions the US Navy shooting down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea.
