Content: PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, and the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/): 
Content: The Harvard International Review (June 19, 2024) discusses the illicit arms trade in Ukraine, highlighting concerns about weapons theft and circulation on the black market. It mentions Ukraine's history of a large black market for arms, with an estimated $32 billion in military equipment lost between 1992 and 1998. The article notes reports of weapons being stolen since 2022, but also warns about Russian disinformation campaigns exaggerating the issue. The US end-use monitoring program focuses on specific weapon systems, with less attention on small arms and light weapons, which are more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations.

Useful result: From [Source](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/): 
Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) published an article on September 23, 2024, discussing the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine. The article mentions the sale of US-made M240 machine guns for $8,000 and Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launchers for $6,000. It also references seizures of weapons, including an anti-aircraft gun and a US machine gun. <image:1149>, <image:1150>, <image:1151>.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The investigation found evidence of corruption and a black market for arms in Ukraine, but no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. Sources like the [Harvard International Review](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/) and the [Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/) highlight illicit arms trade, but do not provide data on the volume of sales.

So, the overall veracity is: false
