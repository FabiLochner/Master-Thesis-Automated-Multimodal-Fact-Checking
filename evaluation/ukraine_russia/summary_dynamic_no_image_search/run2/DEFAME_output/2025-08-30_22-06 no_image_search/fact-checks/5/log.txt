Content: The article from Truthmeter.mk, published on November 4, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Volodymyr Zelensky bought Hitler's Mercedes-Benz 770 for $15 million. The article states that the claim is disinformation, originating from the "news portal" Seattle Tribune, which was created shortly before the news was published. The article provides evidence that the image of the car was manipulated by superimposing it on another photo. The article also mentions that the car was auctioned in Arizona, USA, as early as 2018. <image:4>, <image:167>. The article also mentions that the claim has been fact-checked by multiple sources.

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Hitler's parade car which was bought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 15 Million US-$.' is false.
