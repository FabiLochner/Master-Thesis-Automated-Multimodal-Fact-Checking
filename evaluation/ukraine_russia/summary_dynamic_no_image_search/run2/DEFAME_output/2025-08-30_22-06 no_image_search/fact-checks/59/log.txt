Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763443697/whats-the-ukraine-story-about-trump-says-it-s-biden-democrats-say-it-s-trump): 
Content: NPR published an article on September 23, 2019, discussing the political conflict between Trump and his opponents regarding Ukraine. The article mentions allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine, which Trump and his aides brought up. The article also mentions that Democrats are investigating the White House's conversations with Ukrainian leaders. <image:9717>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Ukraine released a list of US politicians taking bribes, including Joe Biden receiving $92 million, is not supported by the provided evidence. While there are reports of corruption allegations involving Joe Biden and Ukraine, the search results do not mention any such list or confirm the amounts listed in the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
