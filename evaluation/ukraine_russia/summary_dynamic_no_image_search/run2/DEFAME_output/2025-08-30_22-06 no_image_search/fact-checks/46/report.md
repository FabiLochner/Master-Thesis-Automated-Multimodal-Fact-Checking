NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump)) reported that Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Trump at the White House on April 7, 2025, to discuss the war with Hamas in Gaza. ![image 5288](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461862-739066.jpg), ![image 5289](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461864-391400.jpg) ABC7 ([https://abc7.com/post/trump-netanyahu-may-take-victory-lap-iran-gaza-war-looms-meeting/17007239/](https://abc7.com/post/trump-netanyahu-may-take-victory-lap-iran-gaza-war-looms-meeting/17007239/)) also covered the meeting. ![image 5295](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461875-496107.jpg)

The Soufan Center ([https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/)) published an article discussing the White House visit, focusing on discussions about tariffs, negotiations with Iran, and TÃ¼rkiye-Israel relations. ![image 5302](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461879-793481.jpg) None of the sources mention plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his April 2025 visit to the White House is false, according to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/). The article states that the claim is a misinterpretation of a statement made by Netanyahu on April 7, 2025, at the White House ![image 5312](media/2025-08-29_10-05-1756461908-583993.jpg). CNN reported on August 14, 2025, that Netanyahu was in talks with several countries about taking in displaced Palestinians, including South Sudan, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Libya, and Indonesia.

The Times of Israel's live blog from August 28, 2025, mentions a White House meeting on the future of Gaza with US President Donald Trump and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. It also mentions Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's plan regarding Gaza, and an IDF general promising aid to Gazans <image:i>, and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF is operating in Syria <image:j>.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Evidence from [https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/) indicates that the claim is a misinterpretation of a statement made by Netanyahu. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Netanyahu was in talks with other countries, not Ukraine and Syria, about taking in displaced Palestinians.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Benjamin Netanyahu did visit the White House in April 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that he announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The evidence suggests that the claim is a misinterpretation of a statement made by Netanyahu.
