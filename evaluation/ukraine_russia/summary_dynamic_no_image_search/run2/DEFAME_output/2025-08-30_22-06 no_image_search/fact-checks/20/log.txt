Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_237212.htm): 
Content: On August 18, 2025, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte made remarks at a meeting hosted by Donald J. Trump with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders in Washington, D.C. Rutte thanked Trump for starting a dialogue with Putin and expressed excitement about ending the war in Ukraine. He also thanked Trump for his leadership and willingness to participate in security guarantees.

The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Mark Rutte, as NATO Secretary General, discussed Ukraine with Donald Trump, there is no evidence from sources like [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_237031.htm) and news reports to support the statement that Rutte would expel the United States from the alliance if Trump surrendered Ukraine to Putin.

So, the overall veracity is: false
