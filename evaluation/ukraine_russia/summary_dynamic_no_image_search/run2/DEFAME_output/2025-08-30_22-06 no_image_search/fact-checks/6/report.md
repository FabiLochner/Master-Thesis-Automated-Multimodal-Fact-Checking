### Evidence from `web_search`
Defense News reported on August 29, 2024, that an F-16 jet crashed in Ukraine during a Russian attack, resulting in the pilot's death. The article mentions that some F-16s have been used to intercept Russian missiles.

The War Zone discusses claims of a Ukrainian F-16 shooting down a Russian Su-35S Flanker and mentions a Ukrainian F-16 pilot, Oleksiy Mes, who died in August 2024 after shooting down Russian cruise missiles and a drone.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that F-16s have been used in the Ukraine conflict in August 2024. One F-16 crashed in Ukraine, resulting in the pilot's death. There are also claims of F-16s shooting down Russian missiles and a drone. However, the evidence does not mention a US F-16 being shot down over the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders.

The image provided does not appear to be an F-16. The claim is therefore not supported by the evidence.

The claim is missing information about the type of aircraft in the image.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a MiG-29, not an F-16. While F-16s have been involved in the conflict, there is no evidence to support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down over the Black Sea.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image depicts a MiG-29, not an F-16. While F-16s have been used in the Ukraine conflict, there is no evidence to support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down over the Black Sea in August 2024, as reported by [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/08/29/ukraine-f-16-jet-crashes-during-russian-attack-killing-pilot/) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles).
