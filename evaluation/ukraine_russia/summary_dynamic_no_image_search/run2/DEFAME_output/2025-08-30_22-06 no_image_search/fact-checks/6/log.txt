Content: The Defense News published an article on August 29, 2024, stating that an F-16 jet crashed in Ukraine during a Russian attack, killing the pilot. <image:2853>, <image:2852>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.twz.com/air/claims-swirl-around-russian-su-35s-flanker-shootdown): 
Content: The search result from The War Zone discusses claims of a Ukrainian F-16 shooting down a Russian Su-35S Flanker.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 28, 2024, discussing the Ukraine war. The article mentions that Volodymyr Zelenskiy said F-16s were used to shoot down Russian missiles. <image:2868> shows Ukrainian F-16 fighter planes.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts a MiG-29, not an F-16. While F-16s have been used in the Ukraine conflict, there is no evidence to support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down over the Black Sea in August 2024, as reported by [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/08/29/ukraine-f-16-jet-crashes-during-russian-attack-killing-pilot/) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles).

So, the overall veracity is: false
