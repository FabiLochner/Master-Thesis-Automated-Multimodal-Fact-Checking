### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 24](media/75.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The U.S. denied these claims. The Anadolu Agency also reported on Russia's protest regarding the participation of US private military companies.

The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or its connection to the events in the Kursk region.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin, the identity of the individuals, and their involvement in the events in the Kursk region in August 2024.

## Evidence

Injuredoverseas.com reports that the Forward Observation Group, a private military firm, is active in Kursk, and the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the participation of American PMCs proves the involvement of the United States as a direct party to the conflict. (![image 9777](media/2025-08-30_22-29-1756592974-524114.jpg)) Myth Detector fact-checked the claim that the image shows American fighters in the Kursk region and found it to be disinformation. The photo was taken in the Kharkiv region in 2022, and the person depicted is a Ukrainian actor, Serhii Filimonov.
