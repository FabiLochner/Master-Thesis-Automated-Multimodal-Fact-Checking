Useful result: From [Source](https://www.uawire.org/one-of-putin-s-luxury-limos-explodes-and-burns-in-moscow): 
Content: UAWire reports that one of Vladimir Putin's luxury limousines exploded and caught fire near Moscow's FSB headquarters. <image:k> The fire started in the engine of the "Aurus Senat" vehicle. No casualties were recorded. The incident coincides with heightened "paranoia over potential assassination attempts" surrounding the Russian leader.

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: Reports from various news sources, including Newsweek and The Economic Times, indicate that an incident occurred involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, with mentions of a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided evidence confirms the death of Vladimir Putin, thus the claim is unsubstantiated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
