A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. If he had done so, media outlets would have covered it, yet [none have](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=14c9acc35e76766d&q=musk+last+dollar+for+zelenskyy&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWtG_mNb-HwafvV8cKK_h1a5eSkyfXNgRC6a9SKsMT7FKel2oEVH7CAeL9GJLZ9zSE1b0VTwOacLkI4XgtHWeWNmKPMmJVT-fsL2j8HgVBOedFE0rcv3l9ce7iX7VQHiBT41qOitP2uFNPJwqo3Nj1J21-Gh5tg3bNyqf1kLEJ7mR0Orp4LTigYJIGRfW985SFZs7PWg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKqs7Mt9eJAxU8GFkFHTF9LuMQ0pQJegQIEhAB&biw=1440&bih=812&dpr=2)

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

On October 2, 2023, more than a year before Donald Trump’s re-election, Elon Musk shared a meme on his social media platform X that mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, depicting him as a petulant teen. 

“When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” reads the text on the image, showing Zelensky looking sulky. 

The caricature is meant to mock Ukraine’s requests for financial assistance from the United States to help with the war in Ukraine, requests which Musk believes are too frequent and too demanding. 

 ![Légende: Above is a caricature of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky created by a Russian propaganda agency. The image was [produced by](https://www.france.tv/france-2/complement-d-enquete/7065050-guerres-de-propagande-la-france-en-premiere-ligne.html)
 the Social Design Agency (SDA), a Russian agency that the Russian government pays to create influence operations and cause unrest, according to an investigation by [Complément d’Enquête](https://x.com/tristanwaleckx/status/1912803601694568795)
, a show on French television channel France 2. 

While there is no indication that SDA directed Musk to retweet the image, the fact that he did massively amplified the meme’s reach: it garnered more than 95 million views on his X account.  

To study Musk’s messaging on X, teams from the FRANCE 24 Observers, French media outlet France Info, and Belgian media outlet RTBF analysed around 15,000 posts shared by Elon Musk between November 4, 2024, and April 4, 2025, as part of a project through the Public French-speaking Media association ([Médias Francophones Publics](https://www.lesmediasfrancophones.org/)
).  

In order to analyse all of these tweets, we created a computer program based on ChatGPT’s artificial intelligence (see the sidebar at the end of the article). 

This enabled us to identify the hundreds of tweets that make up Elon Musk's anti-Ukraine rhetoric. Shortly after, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine hit Russia with long-range missiles

For his part, Musk expressed himself on X on [November 19](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1858873944327020864)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/15B8C)
), approving the reactions of American political figures who were criticising the supply of missiles, such as those of Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno who said that “Biden dramatically escalated the war” and Donald Trump Junior who wrote that “the American people want peace, not endless war!” In the days around November 17, Musk published 27 posts supporting Russia or criticising Ukraine. 

 ![This graph shows Musk’s tweets that are either pro-Russia or hostile to Ukraine that he posted between November 2024 and April 2025.](https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6b274e0-2515-11f0-987e-005056bfb2b6/w:980/graph-1-EN.png)

This graph shows Musk’s tweets that are either pro-Russia or hostile to Ukraine that he posted between November 2024 and April 2025. The meeting ended in a clash, with the Americans claiming that Zelensky wasn’t showing enough gratitude for the US aid provided to Ukraine.  

Musk published 138 posts related to this turbulent visit, sharing the highlights (or in this case lowlights) of the clash along with commentary, including when Zelensky’s [choice of clothing](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895524314797220118)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/jc3DQ)
) was criticised, when [Trump](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895532321450967266)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/xFtOW)
) claimed Zelensky was “gambling with World War III”, when Vance told Zelensky he was being disrespectful and when Republican Senator [Lindsay Graham](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895582702923067837)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/qMzxc)
) called for Zelensky to step down after the visit. © X / @elonmusk, FRANCE 24 Observers, MFP

Many of Musk’s posts directly criticise Zelensky.

”Elon Musk is picking up Putin’s narrative against the Ukrainian president,” says Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy, who has a doctorate in American civilisation and wrote the book “Trump’s words” ("Les mots de Trump" published by Dalloz.). Sack joined the Trump administration last December to work on issues relating to artificial intelligence and crypto money. 

Musk is also in contact with figures reputed to have close connections with Russia like Mario Nawfal, a Lebanese-Australian influencer who is known for having interviewed Belarusian President [Alexander Lukachenko](https://x.com/AmbassadeBLR/status/1897202102830518722/)
, a close Putin ally, and Ian Miles Cheong, a Malaysian influencer who used to write for [Russia Today](https://time.com/6694681/ian-miles-cheong-malaysia-execution-internet-trending-israel/)
.

“Elon Musk doesn’t explicitly boost pro-Kremlin accounts,” Jessica Yarin Robinson explains. Thank you, [@KGawkowski](https://x.com/KGawkowski)
 \[Editor’s note: Krzysztof Gawkowski, the Polish minister of digital affairs\] and Poland,” Musk tweeted, clearly pleased to have patched things up with his clients. 

_To study Musk’s messaging on X, teams from the France 24 Observers and Belgian broadcaster RTBF analysed and categorised more than 15,000 tweets and retweets shared by his account (@elonmusk) between November 4, 2024 and April 4, 2025._ 

_In order to analyse all of these tweets, we used a method created by researchers in cognitive science at the French higher education institute l__'É__cole Normale supérieure (for more on the method click_ [_here_](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1365508/full)
_), which allowed us to catagorise text using the ChatGPT language model._

_We asked ChatGPT’s API to categorise each tweet, which enabled us to identify all of the tweets that Musk shared that were either hostile to Ukraine or favorable to Russia, as well as those that criticised Europe and those that showed support for the European far right._ 

_We verified the results by manually analysing each post._  

_We examined Musk’s original posts, as well as the posts he shared (such as his retweets or quote tweets). We also included the transcripts of videos that he posted directly or shared from other accounts._

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

 in Brussels that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders - before Russia annexed Crimea - was unrealistic and that the U.S. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Now, NPR has learned that Russia is using the fires to advance anti-Ukraine propaganda as part of its war against that country. So far, there's no evidence that it happened, and the Ukrainian government has denied it to NPR, but researchers say that it is part of a bigger narrative that Russia has pushed for years. Pro-Russian accounts regularly claim that various Ukrainian officials own luxury goods overseas, like yachts, villas and, in one case, a sports car. The underlying idea is that Ukrainian government is corrupt and does not deserve foreign aid, which it is currently receiving for its war with Russia. How did it spread?

HUO: So fact-checkers traced this narrative to pro-Russian Telegram channels. A lot of these accounts and websites have a history of either being a part of or echoing known Russian-influenced operations. Darren Linvill is a professor at Clemson University and codirects its media forensics lab.

DARREN LINVILL: It's just so typical of what we see from Russia and so despicable to take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends.

HUO: You know, aside from undermining Ukraine, Russia also wants to sow internal discord in the United States. We see this both in this disaster and in the Maui fires in 2023.

KELLY: Yeah.

HUO: Russian state media amplified American - often conservative - voices criticizing the government's disaster response. This didn't get much traction, though.

KELLY: And this specific false claim - has it gotten much traction - traveled very far?

HUO: So it's gotten a million views on X with help from one pro-Russian influencer and then an American influencer."

The story that initially circulated was debunked by professional fact checkers from [Greece](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and the [United States](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
. The influencers have said they did not know the company paying them was linked to Russia.

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government’s response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab told NPR in an email. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts have spread baseless claims that Ukrainian military officials owned mansions that were destroyed in the fires that swept the Los Angeles region.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts and outlets have been spreading a [baseless narrative](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
 that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down [in the Los Angeles wildfires](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)
. Researchers who study Russian influence operations say it is part of the Kremlin’s larger campaign to discredit the Ukrainian government and [undermine U.S. support for Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)
.

“It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves.” Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

“It’s just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends,” said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Within hours, it was amplified by several other sources, including another Telegram channel which labeled it as satire, an X account, and a website that resembles a [pro-Russian network](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20240212_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_PORTAL-KOMBAT-NETWORK_ENG_VF.pdf)
 that French authorities previously identified. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council’s Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as “Russian propaganda.” It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The Ukrainian government denied to NPR that any general’s homes were affected by the fire.

The next day, an influencer using the handle @OlgaBazova, who has previously echoed narratives pushed by known Russian influence networks, [shared the story](https://archive.ph/wZHZb)
 in English with its 700,000 followers on X. The account’s bio describes itself as “specializing in humoristic geopolitical analytics, exposing hypocrisy and satire.”

Later in the evening, Robert “Buzz” Patterson, an American conservative influencer with 400,000 followers on X, [repeated the claim](https://archive.ph/2BL9c)
, seemingly without irony, in a post that has been viewed over a million times, according to X’s data.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:

When contacted by NPR on X about the post, @OlgaBazova responded with a link to a Russian-language article that cited the original Telegram claim about the mansions.

Patterson did not respond to messages from NPR asking why he had posted the claim.

Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova (<image:4830>) and the spread of wildfires in Los Angeles County (<image:4831>). The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, stating that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to California fire victims (<image:4838>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

The new evidence reinforces the previous findings. It highlights that Russia leveraged the California wildfires to sow division and spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. However, the evidence still does not mention any offers of assistance from Russia.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence focuses on Russia's use of the wildfires for propaganda purposes, not on providing aid.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

#### Maria Zakharova

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman

U.S. uses forced labor by involving inmates in fighting Los Angeles fires, while sanctioning China for using forced labor in Xinjiang.

[Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025](https://ria.ru/20250112/zaharova-1993301092.html "Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025")

False

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the United States of “obscurantist hypocrisy” for allowing inmates to fight Los Angeles wildfires. has been condemning for years.

"Hundreds of prisoners have been recruited to fight wildfires in southern California … In recent years, U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized China for using forced labor, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region … \[W\]ill Congress impose sanctions on the California government, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to fight fires."

The claim is false.

[In California, inmates voluntarily join firefighting crews](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5254122/inmate-firefighters-california-wildfires)
 if they meet the program’s qualifications, which consider physical fitness and behavioral records. government is impoverishing its own citizens.

Speaking at a January 14 press conference on the results of Russian diplomacy in 2024, Lavrov said, that Americans “burned almost all of California,” and the damage is estimated $250 billion, which is “comparable” to what the U.S. pledged to [Ukraine](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine)
 about $66.2 billion in [security assistance](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/09/2003626079/-1/-1/1/KEY-ACHIEVEMENTS-AND-FACTS-US-SECURITY-ASSISTANCE-TO-UKRAINE.PDF)
 between 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and February 2022 when Moscow launched a war, and about $66.5 billion since.

Lavrov’s claim that by aiding Ukraine the U.S. society, in part due to the [Russian propaganda influence](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5101895/doj-says-russia-paid-right-wing-influencers-to-spread-russian-propaganda)
.

Experts, however, argue that opposite to draining American economy, the large portion of the Ukraine aid is being reinvested domestically, [boosting defense manufacturing industry and sustaining jobs](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/us-aid-ukraine-helps-american-economy-and-boosts-us-jobs)
.

Russian propaganda exploited the Ukrainian angle in the Los Angeles fires trying to spread false accusations against Ukraine’s military command of misappropriating the Western aid.

Russia’s newly emerged group of social media influencers nicknamed “milbloggers” as most members are either Russian combatants or pro-war reporters from the battle lines in Ukraine, played key role in creating and spreading such false claims.

Russian Telegram channel Voennyj obozrevatel' (Military Observer) alleged on January 11, that eight mansions worth a total of $90 million owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military officials, were destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires.

“According to Ukrainian sources, 8 mansions owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military personnel were burned during large-scale wildfires in Los Angeles. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began.”

Russian state-controlled news sites and media outlets, including Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, News.ru, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Tsargrad, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta used the post in their news coverage.

[Multiple fact-checking outlets](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and even some Russian news media debunked the post as lacking merit and unsubstantiated.

Yet the claim about the luxury villas of Ukrainian generals allegedly burning down in Los Angeles spread on X the following days, receiving millions of views and thousands of reposts.

In another disinformation plot, on January 13-14, Russian state-owned news sites sought to undermine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision to send Ukrainian firefighters to Los Angeles to help put out the wildfires.

State-owned RIA Novosti, RT, and others used an X post by “Ukrainian journalist” Diana Panchenko, who wrote responding to Zeleskyy’s announcement: "I am glad that hundreds of men will have the opportunity to leave Ukraine these days."

Russian news outlets generalized the post, speculating it signaled that Ukrainian journalists oppose Ukraine's fight for independence and the Ukrainian men are desperate to leave the country.

In fact, Reporters Without Borders exposed [Diana Panchenko as Russian propagandist](https://rsf.org/en/diana-panchenko-ukrainian-propagandist-working-kremlin)

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Расплата за Иловайск: оккупанты понесли огромные потери при бегстве из Балаклеи, видео

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)
.

  

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)
.

Украинский журналист **Денис Казанский** опубликовал красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ «селфятся» на фоне лежащего на земле оккупанта.

«Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!», - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне убегали так быстро, что бросали тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, отмечает журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист **Анатолий Цаплиенко** сообщает, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)

 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

The evidence indicates that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The U.S. denied these claims. The Anadolu Agency also reported on Russia's protest regarding the participation of US private military companies.

The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or its connection to the events in the Kursk region.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin, the identity of the individuals, and their involvement in the events in the Kursk region in August 2024.

Content: "<image:9777>

A recent photo confirms that Forward Observation Group, a private military firm under contract with Ukraine, is active in Kursk.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the participation of the American PMCs on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the invasion of the Kursk region proves the involvement of the United States as a [direct party to the conflict](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/08/22/mercenaries-from-the-forward-observation-group-pmcs-were-destroyed-in-the-kursk-region-video)
, and mercenaries automatically become a legitimate military target. To avoid a fair fight with an experienced lawyer, most insurance companies settle DBA claims on victim-friendly terms prior to this hearing.

For more information about DBA lost wage replacement, contact [Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A.](https://www.injuredoverseas.com/contact-us/)

  American Private Military Contractors Are in Kursk - Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A. The Foreign Ministry stressed that in relation to the American citizens involved, in accordance with the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the necessary investigative actions will be carried out to bring them to justice.

The Russian press accused FOG contractors of targeting civilians during the fighting. Then, things changed.

Ukraine’s Kursk offensive is the latest phase in this war and marks the first time fighting has occurred on Russian soil. Prior to the Kursk incursion, Russia was taking roughly 1,000 casualties a day, with corresponding equipment losses. It would likely require several months of recruitment and military production to stop Ukrainian advances and secure Kursk. Alternatively, Russia could continue operations in the Donbas and pay the domestic price of ignoring the Ukrainian incursion and effectively ceding parts of Kursk and Belgorod to Ukraine. But Ukrainian mobile operations in Kursk require much more dynamic air operations, and Ukrainian drones have downed numerous Russian drones. Russia is now forced to fly longer distances in attempts to stop Ukraine in Kursk. Longer flights mean fewer Russian bombs dropped per day. 

#### **What Contractors Do**

That last section touched on the major responsibilities of American private military contractors operating independently of U.S."

Injuredoverseas.com reports that the Forward Observation Group, a private military firm, is active in Kursk, and the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the participation of American PMCs proves the involvement of the United States as a direct party to the conflict. (<image:9777>) Myth Detector fact-checked the claim that the image shows American fighters in the Kursk region and found it to be disinformation. The photo was taken in the Kharkiv region in 2022, and the person depicted is a Ukrainian actor, Serhii Filimonov. (<image:9785>, <image:9778>, <image:9779>)
