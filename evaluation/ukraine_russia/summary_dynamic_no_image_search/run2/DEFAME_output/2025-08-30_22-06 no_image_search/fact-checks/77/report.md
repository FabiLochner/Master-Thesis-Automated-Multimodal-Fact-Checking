## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported on a Polish military parade in Warsaw on August 15, 2024, for Armed Forces Day, which included over 2,500 troops and military vehicles. The parade was also mentioned in an article by Polish Radio on August 12, 2024, which stated that the parade would take place on August 15 and showcase military hardware, including South Korean-made K2 battle tanks and US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks. The parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East. ![image 25](media/77.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a military parade did take place in Poland on August 15, 2024, not August 14, as stated in the claim. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and included military vehicles. The evidence also suggests that the parade was a display of strength, possibly in response to external threats.

The claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence. While the parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East, this does not explicitly mean it was preparing for war.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim's veracity.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a Polish military parade that took place on August 15, 2024, not August 14, as stated in the claim. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and included military vehicles. The evidence does not support the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Polish military parade that occurred on August 15, 2024, as reported by the Associated Press and Polish Radio, not on August 14 as the claim states. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and showcased military hardware. While the parade was described as a display of strength, there is no evidence to support the claim that it was specifically preparing for war with Russia.
