The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

**A US National Football League (NFL) quarterback has refused to stand for the national anthem in protest at what he sees as racial injustice.**

Colin Kaepernick, who plays with the San Francisco 49ers, remained seated as the anthem was played.

"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour," he explained.

Some fans booed the player when he took to the field.

But his team said they supported his right to protest, which took place as the 49ers hosted the Green Bay Packers in a pre-season game on Friday.

"We recognise the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem," the team said.

An NFL spokesman said players were "encouraged but not required" to stand during the anthem.

From [Source](https://www.vogue.com/article/colin-kaepernick-nfl-player-protest): 
Content: "However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

This past Friday, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem during a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick, 28, [later said](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem)
. Common arguments online include: _How dare Kaepernick disrespect the very country that enabled him to become a rich athlete?_ (his current contract is reported to be worth $114 million), and, _He’s only making a political statement now because his career is on the decline_ (he’s struggled to bounce back after three surgeries).

This feverish level of ire is ironic when you consider that, in recent years, NFL players have committed a laundry list of criminal offenses that prompted less outcry. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” When “I feel like that flag represents what it’s supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way that it’s supposed to,” he continued, “I’ll stand.”

Though the likes of the NBA’s LeBron James and Dwyane Wade have voiced their support for #BlackLivesMatter, and WNBA team the Minnesota Lynx wore black practice jerseys after the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, Kaepernick is weathering a bigger backlash. (So be it, Kaepernick said: “If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”) Fringe websites are alleging he has covertly converted to Islam, which, some people still don’t get, would say absolutely nothing about his patriotism. The only crime by an NFL player that the general population seemed as angry about as Kaepernick’s sitting during the national anthem was Michael Vick’s role in a dogfighting ring.

“Of all the offensive things professional football players do, taking a political stance seems to be one of the least objectionable,” Michael Ian Black sagely tweeted over the weekend.

So why does Kaepernick’s peaceful and perfectly legal protest strike more of a chord than, say, killing a man? Because many people believe patriotism is all or nothing: You either comply with the standard, traditional means of loving your country—standing for the national anthem with your hand firmly over your heart (an oversight Gabby Douglas was bullied for during the Olympics)—or you may as well be a Russian spy with ISIL ties. Those people have a right to burn Kaepernick jerseys and disagree with him, just like he has a right to peaceful protest. Though we may all agree on some things, even many things, ultimately my lens as the daughter of a Cuban immigrant may differ from Kaepernick’s as a mixed-race man (I don’t care how rich he is), and a blue-blooded daughter of the Mayflower does not know the particular struggle of an African-American boy raised in poverty in inner-city L.A.

The truth is that patriotism is not one-size-fits-all, and loving your country—like loving anyone or anything—is not complete, total, and unwavering. Why can’t Kaepernick care about his country, while also calling it out, and holding it to a higher standard?"

# Your Summary

Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Colin Kaepernick's protest is 'dumb and disrespectful'
===========================================================================

This article is more than 8 years old

The US supreme court justice in an interview with Katie Couric said sitting out national anthem is a ‘terrible thing’ for the NFL quarterback to do but not illegal

NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protest is “dumb and disrespectful”, the supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview released on Monday.

In a [wide-ranging interview](https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/ruth-bader-ginsburg-on-trump-kaepernick-and-her-lifelong-love-of-the-law-132236633.html)
 with Yahoo News’s Katie Couric, Ginsburg said she thought that while Kaepernick’s protest was legal, it was “a terrible thing to do”.

“What do I think? Kaepernick he was protesting against racial injustice in America, especially against police brutality.

It caught national attention and later inspired a host of [other NFL players](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football)
 and [sports stars](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/megan-rapinoe-national-anthem-protest-usa-soccer)
 to follow suit.

But Kaepernick’s protest has also drawn criticism, with some calling it disrespectful towards military servicemen and women. She [later said](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/14/ruth-bader-ginsburg-regrets-donald-trump-remarks-faker)
 those remarks were ill-advised.

 Kaepernick was exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. [At a CNN town hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=279&v=VPqOotT_ta8)
 a few weeks later, he said he wanted both sides to listen to each other.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump [said Kaepernick](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest)
 “should find a country that works better for him”.

Ginsburg caused controversy earlier this year when [she said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump)
 she could not imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as president. I think it’s dumb and disrespectful. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act.”

Ginsburg went to some lengths to say that the protest was legal but that she disagreed with Kaepernick and other athletes’ stance.

“If they want to be stupid, there’s no law that should be preventive. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that.”

In August, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Kaepernick began sitting or kneeling during the national anthem in the pre-game buildup. Kaepernick has reiterated that it is not targeted at members of the military.

Barack Obama has also weighed in on Kaepernick’s protest."

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

*   Russia's online disinformation campaign extended well beyond 2016 and focused heavily on the NFL kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to stoke racial tensions, according to a new Senate report.

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
.

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Meeting between US and Ukraine presidents descends into chaos at White House – here’s what they said, word for word

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Vance**: That’s exactly what you’re doing …

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

On February 28, 2025, [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")
, the [president of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
, [JD Vance](/wiki/JD_Vance "JD Vance")
, the [vice president of the United States](/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States "Vice president of the United States")
, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, the [president of Ukraine](/wiki/President_of_Ukraine "President of Ukraine")
, held a highly contentious bilateral meeting televised live in the [Oval Office](/wiki/Oval_Office "Oval Office")
 at the [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")
 in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. Trump subsequently criticized him on his social media platform, [Truth Social](/wiki/Truth_Social "Truth Social")
, where he accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy a "dictator" for not holding elections – even though the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during [martial law](/wiki/Martial_law_in_Ukraine "Martial law in Ukraine")
, which was in effect in Ukraine at the time.[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)
 The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a European-backed [General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
 [resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-11/7 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/7")
 on February 24, 2025, to condemn Russia and demand a withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

The Trump administration initially intended to cancel Zelenskyy's trip to Washington one week beforehand but was persuaded by French president [Emmanuel Macron](/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron")
 to proceed with it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)
 The administration urged Ukraine to agree to share revenue from its raw minerals with the United States,[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)
 and Zelenskyy had reportedly been planning to sign a [framework agreement](/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93United_States_Mineral_Resources_Agreement "Ukraine–United States Mineral Resources Agreement")
 related to raw minerals during his visit.[\[37\]](#cite_note-37)
 The idea for the agreement was originally proposed by Ukraine to the Biden administration in 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-woda25-30)
[\[38\]](#cite_note-mysp25-38)
 In January 2025, Ukraine signed a 100-year partnership with the United Kingdom also involving minerals.[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 Prior to Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump, senator [Lindsey Graham](/wiki/Lindsey_Graham "Lindsey Graham")
 told Zelenskyy to focus on the present minerals agreement and to discuss a ceasefire and security guarantees later.[\[6\]](#cite_note-:8-6)

President Donald Trump suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “not a man that wanted to make peace,” while claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin does want to end the war.

The Russian president by contrast, Trump said, “is going to want to make it, he wants to make it, he wants to end it.”

The comments from Trump came after an earlier meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart [devolved into an angry exchange](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/trump-zelensky-vance-oval-office/index.html)
 over the nature of US support and whether Zelensky had shown enough gratitude.

Asked whether he was considering cutting off military aid to Ukraine, Trump responded: “It doesn’t matter what I’m considering. He also said he was “grateful for the unwavering bicameral and bipartisan support.”

The US Agency for International Development’s $25 million contribution to an initiative to support Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure against Russian attacks was terminated this week, according to a source familiar.

NBC News was [first to report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/state-department-terminates-us-support-ukraine-energy-grid-restoration-rcna194259)
.

**Some context:** The termination was among thousands foreign assistance awards canceled this week and came ahead of President Donald Trump’s contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The money was for the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, which supports the Ukrainian government’s effort to support and repair their energy infrastructure, which has faced relentless Russian attacks throughout the course of the war.

Although the cancellation occurred before the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelensky, it comes amid a radical shift in policy toward Ukraine that has left some longtime diplomats shocked.

“I’m literally sick to my stomach,” one diplomat told CNN Friday.

“I fear for the fallout,” they said, predicting that “no one in Ukraine will sleep well tonight.”

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)
, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

[!U.S. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers.

Zelenskyy tried to object, saying he has "all the respect for your country" and saying, "I said thanks," as Trump raised his voice to speak over him.

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled. Zelenskyy left the White House but didn't take questions.

Zelenskyy came to Washington and was expected to [sign a deal](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312880/trump-zelenskyy-minerals-ukraine-russia)
 that would give the United States access to [Ukrainian rare earth and critical minerals](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)
. We're trying to solve a problem."

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

### Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. 28, 2025

An earlier headline incorrectly said President Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "ungrateful." Trump said Zelenskyy was "not acting at all thankful."

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)

 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)

, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that it would cost Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. The article also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war. The article also states that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While a British Army official estimated that 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties would be needed to control four regions of Ukraine, the provided sources do not confirm that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops. The Russia Matters article states that over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. Additionally, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died by the end of 2024.

The evidence indicates that the number of casualties is high, but it does not support the specific figure of 1.5 million troops lost as of February 2025. The data from Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides estimates up to December 2024, which is not aligned with the claim's timeframe.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses in February 2025 would be needed.

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Shortfalls in required monitoring by American officials mean the U.S. cannot track more than $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to [Ukraine to fight invading Russian forces](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-lithuania-estonia-latvia-22ee93052cc1a6f21ea5ab586f42a3de)
, according to a Pentagon audit released Thursday.

The findings mean that 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear that the U.S. has provided Ukraine and was directed to guard against misuse or theft remained “delinquent,” the report by the Defense Department’s office of the inspector-general, the watchdog body for the Pentagon, said.

While Biden administration officials stressed Thursday that there was no evidence the weapons had been stolen, the audit undermines two years of lavish assurances from the administration that rigorous monitoring would keep U.S. The audit findings are likely to make Biden’s task even harder.

House Republican opposition for months has stalled Biden’s request to Congress [for $105 billion more](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ukraine-israel-budget-3762a0bdf00653e3c8a38175d3c3d3cb)
 for Ukraine, Israel and other national security objectives. The end-use monitoring was required for gear that had sensitive technology and was smaller, making it more vulnerable to arms trafficking.

The Pentagon inspector general’s report said that the Defense Department had failed to maintain an accurate serial-number inventory of those defense articles for Ukraine as required.

Reasons for the shortfall in monitoring included limited staffing; the fact that procedures for carrying out end-use monitoring in a war zone weren’t put in place until December 2022; restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine; and a lack of internal controls on inventory, the report said.

While the U.S. had improved monitoring since the first year of the war, “significant personnel limitations and accountability challenges remain,” auditors said; full accounting of the gear was impossible as long as those shortfalls remained, they said.

Kirby said administration officials “has for many months now been interested in improving accountability over the end use of material that is provided to Ukraine.”

The audit didn’t attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. It noted the Defense Department inspector-general’s office now had people stationed in Ukraine, and that its criminal investigators were still looking into allegations of criminal misuse of the security assistance.

Defense Department officials told auditors they expected to have systems for improved oversight in place this year and next.

From [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/): 
Content: "Storch announced today that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released the “Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine.” This audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies.

“Robust internal controls are the backbone for efficiency and accountability,” said IG Storch. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Inspector General Robert P. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose."

Verification within Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program

A video report, supposedly from The Wall Street Journal, is being [circulated](https://t.me/sheyhtamir1974/94005)
 online claiming that the U.S. Department of Defense is demanding that Kyiv conduct a full audit of all American weapons supplied to Ukraine. This demand is alleged to be due to the anticipated reduction or even complete cessation of arms supplies to Ukraine following Donald Trump’s potential victory in the presidential elections.

**However, this is a fake. Department of Defense’s [website](https://www.defense.gov/News/?Page=5)
 does not mention any requirement for Ukraine to conduct such an audit.

Furthermore, all quotes attributed to The Wall Street Journal’s national security and intelligence correspondent, [Warren Strobel](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/warren-p-strobel)
, are fabricated — he has not written about any audit in his articles or on [social media](https://twitter.com/wstrobel)
. On June 18, 2024, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a [report](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smoke-on-the-horizon-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-conflict-in-Ukraine-GI-TOC-June-2024.v3.pdf)
 on arms market trends in the context of Russian aggression. It stated that while any war carries the risk of increased international arms trade, Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to prevent these risks and has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures. The report notes that arms control is one of the state’s priorities.

The narrative that military aid to Ukraine ends up in the hands of terrorists and criminal groups is primarily aimed at a Western audience. Additionally, there is no [information](https://archive.ph/zkuGs)
 online about a supposed 20-day Pentagon deadline for a weapons audit. WSJ colleagues would not have made such an error.

Warren Strobel has also not written about the risk of weapons supplied to Ukraine ending up on the black market."

Content: The Associated Press published an article stating that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine. The Pentagon's inspector general found that 59% of the $1.7 billion in defense gear provided to Ukraine remained "delinquent". The article mentions that the reasons for the shortfall in monitoring include limited staffing, restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine, and a lack of internal controls on inventory. The audit did not attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. <image:k>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

*   Jets, drones, helicopters, tanks and air defenses popular
*   Foreign military sales up 45.7%
*   Direct commercial sales up 27.5%

Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments in 2024 surged 29% to a record $318.7 billion, the State Department said on Friday, as countries sought to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine and prepare for major conflicts.

The figures from the Biden administration's final year underpin expectations of stronger sales for U.S. [Trump wants](/world/us/trump-says-not-sure-us-should-be-spending-anything-nato-2025-01-23/)
 other members of NATO to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense – a huge increase from the current 2% goal and a level that no NATO country, including the United States, currently reaches.

Defense contractors are straining to meet the surge of demand that has mushroomed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. is seeking to replenish stockpiles of weaponry and munitions sent to Kyiv.

Arms sales and transfers are viewed as "important U.S. weapons makers, which are expecting that orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, hundreds of Patriot missile interceptors, and a surge in orders for armored vehicles will underpin their results in coming quarters.

There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. arms trade and defense industry. Mike also spends a lot of his time writing on Ukraine and how industry has adapted, or faltered as it supports that conflict. Before his time in Washington Mike’s coverage focused on mergers and acquisitions for oil and gas companies, financial institutions, defense companies, consumer product makers, retailers, real estate giants, and telecommunications companies.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

The Trump administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine, providing a potentially powerful tool to Kyiv as it continues to face a [relentless assault by Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-attack-hnk-intl)
.

The announcement of the proposed $825 million sale Thursday comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have yet to yield a result and following a deadly night of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital.

It was announced after President Donald Trump met this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin and separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Although the Trump administration has approved a number of sales of equipment to sustain existing weapons, this appears to be the first major arms sale of new weapons to Ukraine announced by the administration.

A source familiar said that if the sale is concluded as expected, the missiles – which have a range of 150-280 miles – could be delivered later this year.

It is unclear whether there will be restrictions on their use.

“Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase,” the notice from the State Department said. “The ERAM is an example of working together with our NATO allies to develop a capable and scalable system capable of being delivered on a fast timeline.”

“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,” it said.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

 the homes and offices of arms dealers across the country Tuesday as part of a corruption investigation launched by Ukraine, officials said.

The raids, carried out in multiple regions including Sofia, followed a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is probing alleged overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv.

Acting Interior Ministry Secretary General Miroslav Rashkov said no arrests had been made and that the searches were being conducted under the supervision of the National Investigation Service. Bulgaria Raids Arms Dealers in Ukraine-Led Corruption Probe
===========================================================

Law enforcement teams search homes and offices in multiple cities at Kyiv’s request, but no arrests have been made so far.

Raids were conducted in several areas, including Sofia, in response to a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating suspected overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv. Many deliveries are routed through intermediaries before reaching Ukrainian buyers, a process now under scrutiny in several countries.

Rashkov said the operation remained underway Tuesday afternoon and declined to speculate on possible arrests or charges.

The Supreme Prosecution Office of Cassation said it was overseeing the searches, which form part of an international effort to combat corruption and abuse in the arms trade. Bulgarian officials have not named the targets of the raids or confirmed whether any evidence has been found.

Ukrainian investigators allege certain intermediaries, including foreign-based arms dealers, profited from wartime defense contracts by inflating prices. It is unclear whether any seized materials will be shared directly with Ukrainian authorities.

Bulgaria is a producer and transit hub for weapons supplied to Ukraine, with exports surging since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

 for arms in Europe, with around 300,000 small arms and light weapons reported lost or stolen during the Russian invasion of Crimea between 2013 and 2015. This number is small compared to the estimated US$32 billion [lost](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 in Ukrainian military equipment stolen and sold on the black market between 1992 and 1998. Facts or False Alarms: The State of Illicit Arms in Ukraine
===========================================================

19.Jun.2024 . These two problems, which continue to plague lawmakers in Washington, have been exacerbated by the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine.

### The Illegal Movement of Weapons

_Weaponry Theft in Ukraine: Reality or Russian Disinformation?_

The invasion of Ukraine has [led](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 to a larger quantity of weapons entering Europe, and thus a greater possibility for weapons to go missing. Since 2022, there have been sporadic [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/pentagon-watchdog-report-ukraine-weaponry/index.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 of small and large arms being stolen in Ukraine. Although it is difficult to confirm when and where weapons are stolen, the sheer scale of [weapon transfers](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 means that it is highly likely that some weapons will go missing over the course of the conflict.

However, when examining the extent to which illicit weapons are being used or sold in Ukraine, it is important to acknowledge the massive amount of Russian [disinformation](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4403926-pentagon-watchdog-ukraine-military-aid/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 about these weapons. Reports about Finnish gangsters, French rioters, Nigerian fighters, and Mexican cartels gaining weapons—like rifles and grenade launchers—from Ukraine have all been [debunked](https://riskbulletins.globalinitiative.net/ukr-obs-001/01-monitoring-illicit-arms-flows-from-the-conflict-in-ukraine.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 as Russian propaganda attempting to sway the United States and NATO allies to decrease arms transfers. The current US end-use monitoring program [focuses](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems and Anti-Tank/All-purpose Tactical Guided Missiles because of the classified information used to build those weapons. Contrarily, monitoring efforts have paid little attention to small arms and light weapons, yet those are the weapons more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations in Ukraine."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Harvard International Review (June 19, 2024) discusses the illicit arms trade in Ukraine, highlighting concerns about weapons theft and circulation on the black market. It mentions Ukraine's history of a large black market for arms, with an estimated $32 billion in military equipment lost between 1992 and 1998. The article notes reports of weapons being stolen since 2022, but also warns about Russian disinformation campaigns exaggerating the issue. The US end-use monitoring program focuses on specific weapon systems, with less attention on small arms and light weapons, which are more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations.

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

From [Source](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/): 
Content: The Harvard International Review (June 19, 2024) discusses the illicit arms trade in Ukraine, highlighting concerns about weapons theft and circulation on the black market. It mentions Ukraine's history of a large black market for arms, with an estimated $32 billion in military equipment lost between 1992 and 1998. The article notes reports of weapons being stolen since 2022, but also warns about Russian disinformation campaigns exaggerating the issue. The US end-use monitoring program focuses on specific weapon systems, with less attention on small arms and light weapons, which are more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel
---------------------------------------------

### News Release

[< Back to News Room](/news)

! <image:1348>

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

### Weapons used by Houthi militants

According to [Armament Research Services](/wiki/Armament_Research_Services "Armament Research Services")
, Houthi weapons are mostly of Russian, Chinese or Iranian origin.[\[107\]](#cite_note-115)
[\[108\]](#cite_note-116)
 They are known to use [surface-to-surface missiles](/wiki/Surface-to-surface_missile "Surface-to-surface missile")
, [artillery rockets](/wiki/Artillery_rocket "Artillery rocket")
, [loitering munitions](/wiki/Loitering_munition "Loitering munition")
 and [unmanned aerial vehicles](/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle "Unmanned aerial vehicle")
 (UAVs).[\[109\]](#cite_note-117)
 They have several missiles and UAVs capable of reaching Israel from Yemen:

*   [Toufan](/w/index.php?title=Toufan_(missile)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Toufan (missile) (page does not exist)")
     – a [surface-to-surface missile](/wiki/Surface-to-surface_missile "Surface-to-surface missile")
    , with a range of 1,800 km (1,100 mi).[\[110\]](#cite_note-amwaj-118)
    
*   [Cruise missiles](/wiki/Cruise_missile "Cruise missile")
     – from the Iranian [Soumar](/wiki/Soumar_(missile) "Soumar (missile)")
     family, with strike ranges of about 2,000 km (1,200 mi).[\[110\]](#cite_note-amwaj-118)
    
*   [Quds-2 missile](/wiki/Quds_cruise_missile#Quds-2 "Quds cruise missile")

     – UAVs/loitering munitions with ranges of 1,800 km (1,100 mi) and further.[\[111\]](#cite_note-mei-119)
    
*   [Wa'id drones](/w/index.php?title=Wa%27id_drones&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wa'id drones (page does not exist)")
     – similar to Iran's [Shahed 136](/wiki/Shahed_136 "Shahed 136")

Houthi attacks on commercial vessels
------------------------------------

Main article: [Houthi attacks on commercial vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")

Houthi forces began attacking shipping vessels affiliated with [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 passing through the Red Sea on 19 November 2023. The video game's developers, [Bohemia Interactive](/wiki/Bohemia_Interactive "Bohemia Interactive")
, said that action taken against the videos was ineffective, saying: "With every video flagged, debunked, or taken down, ten more can be uploaded each day."[\[122\]](#cite_note-cbsnews20240605-130)
 Footage from the video game has also been misrepresented as attacks on shipping[\[128\]](#cite_note-136)
 and a US fighter jet being shot down by the Houthis over Sanaa.[\[129\]](#cite_note-137)

### Foreign involvement

#### Iran

_[Reuters](/wiki/Reuters "Reuters")
_, citing [unnamed Iranian sources](/wiki/Anonymous_source "Anonymous source")
 and "a security official close to Iran", has claimed that Iranian personnel are in Yemen, working with [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
 militants. An insurance group earlier stated that an Iranian-made missile was used after examining debris aboard the vessel.[\[133\]](#cite_note-Noor-141)
[\[134\]](#cite_note-142)

[NBC News](/wiki/NBC_News "NBC News")
, citing two US officials, reported in September 2024 that Iran was directly assisting the Houthis with targeting and attacking American [MQ-9 Reaper](/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper "General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper")
 drones, several of which were shot down or damaged during the Red Sea crisis. ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-fn1_9-0)
     [_**b**_](#cite_ref-fn1_9-1)
     Saudi Arabia and Egypt have not joined the coalition against the Houthis, but they have shot down Houthi missiles over their own territory.

The **Red Sea crisis** ([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language")
: أزمة البحر الأحمر) began on 19 October 2023, when the [Iran-backed](/wiki/Iranian_support_for_the_Houthis "Iranian support for the Houthis")
 [Houthis](/wiki/Houthis "Houthis")
 in [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen")
 launched missiles and armed drones at [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
, demanding an end to the [invasion of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip")
.[\[84\]](#cite_note-aljazeera20231219-92)
[\[85\]](#cite_note-AP14Jun2024-93)
 The Houthis have since [seized or bombarded dozens of merchant and naval vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")
 in the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea")
 and received hundreds of retaliatory air strikes by the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
 and allied forces.[\[86\]](#cite_note-Diakun-94)
 The crisis is linked to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
, the [Iran–Israel proxy war](/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_proxy_war "Iran–Israel proxy war")
, and the [Yemeni crisis](/wiki/Yemeni_crisis "Yemeni crisis")

[\[88\]](#cite_note-theguardian20240103-96)
[\[89\]](#cite_note-cnbc20240103-97)

Since 2014, the Houthis, who oppose [Yemen's internationally recognized government](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
, have controlled a considerable swath of the country's territory along the Red Sea. The sources also stated that Iran has escalated its provision of advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, since the outbreak of the Gaza war.[\[3\]](#cite_note-hez-4)

US officials told _[Semafor](/wiki/Semafor_(website) "Semafor (website)")
_ that commanders and advisors from Iran's [Revolutionary Guards](/wiki/Revolutionary_Guards "Revolutionary Guards")
 are currently stationed in Yemen, and are directly involved in the Houthi attacks on commercial traffic in the Red Sea. The [Qods Force](/wiki/Qods_Force "Qods Force")
, has overseen the transfer of the attack drones, cruise missiles, and medium-range ballistic missiles which have been used in the strikes on Red Sea and Israeli targets in recent weeks.[\[1\]](#cite_note-semafor-2)

According to Western intelligence officials, the Iranian [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps")
 placed an intelligence gathering ship to guide Houthi attacks on ships that switch off radios and identifiers.[\[130\]](#cite_note-138)
 According to the Institute for the Study of War, this was likely [MV _Behshad_](/wiki/MV_Behshad "MV Behshad")
, which had replaced [MV _Saviz_](/wiki/MV_Saviz "MV Saviz")
 (which had been used to supply weapons and intelligence to the Houthis until it came under an Israeli [limpet mine](/wiki/Limpet_mine "Limpet mine")
 attack in April 2021).[\[131\]](#cite_note-139)
 The [Iranian](/wiki/Iranian_Navy "Iranian Navy")
 frigate [_Alborz_](/wiki/IRIS_Alborz_(72) "IRIS Alborz (72)")
 later also entered the Red Sea.[\[132\]](#cite_note-Al_Arabiya_English-140)

In July 2024, the [Defense Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency "Defense Intelligence Agency")
 reported that the Houthis used an Iranian-made missile in their attack on the Norwegian-flagged _Strinda_ on 11 December 2023. The officials did not elaborate on how Iran was helping the Houthis, but Michael Knights of the American think tank [Washington Institute for Near East Policy](/wiki/The_Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy "The Washington Institute for Near East Policy")
 said the Houthis received Iranian surface-to-air missiles, such as the [358](/wiki/358_missile "358 missile")
 and [SA-2](/wiki/S-75_Dvina "S-75 Dvina")
, that allowed them to improve their air defenses and target US drones.[\[135\]](#cite_note-143)

#### North Korea

[Voice of America](/wiki/Voice_of_America "Voice of America")
 reported that [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea")
 may have shipped weapons to the Houthis via Iran based on [Hangul](/wiki/Hangul "Hangul")
 writing that was found on Houthi-launched missiles.[\[136\]](#cite_note-North_Korea-144)

#### China

Two China-based companies were sanctioned by the US in 2024 for providing "dual-use materials and components needed to manufacture, maintain, and deploy an arsenal of advanced missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against U.S."

From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/us/drone-sightings-east-coast): 
Content: "The flying objects have been spotted over residential neighborhoods, restricted sites and critical infrastructure.

The sightings have put intense pressure on [federal agencies](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/politics/mysterious-drone-sightings-lawmakers-criticize-response/index.html)
 to provide more information about the aircraft, as officials have urged calm and emphasized there is no evidence suggesting the sightings pose a security threat.

The Biden administration has not identified “anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risks over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the Northeast,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday.

“We assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircrafts, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,” Kirby said. [](#maincontent)

Are drones spotted over NJ dangerous? And calls for military intervention.

This isn’t the plot of “War of the Worlds,” but rather the result of numerous possible drone sightings in recent weeks. While the FBI is still checking out 100 or so tips, none of them appear nefarious, he said.

“I can’t rule out the fact that we might find some sort of illegal or criminal activity, some nefarious activity, (but) all I can do is tell you that right now we see none of that,” Kirby said.

The US is sending drone detection and tracking systems to two military facilities in New Jersey, according to three defense officials Monday. The systems are in the process of moving to Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, in northern New Jersey and Naval Weapons Station Earle in central New Jersey, the officials said.

Drones have been spotted near [Picatinny Arsenal](https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1866933937467166857)
 and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to [military officials](https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1866933937467166857)
 and [state lawmakers](https://x.com/SenBooker/status/1866607594837848396/photo/1)
. The sightings prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.

“Several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” were also reported above [Naval Weapons Station Earle](https://cnrma.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NWS-Earle/)
, a US Navy base south of Middletown, although no direct threats were identified.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy received a briefing from the FBI on Sunday night regarding the drone sighting investigation around Naval Weapons Station Earle, he said in [a post on X](https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1868499153153855491)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```

web_search("drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones, with the Houthis claiming to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The article mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR reports that Houthi rebels have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen) The Wikipedia article discusses the Red Sea crisis, which began in October 2023, and mentions the Houthis launching attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and receiving retaliatory strikes from the US and allies. The Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs. The article also mentions the US Navy shooting down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The NPR article states that the Houthis have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. The Wikipedia article mentions that the Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs.

The image's location is most likely in Israel. The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the type of aircraft involved.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the Houthis have shot down US drones. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun offered condolences to the soldiers who were killed and injured, stressing that the military “is paying, in blood, the price of preserving stability in the south” of the country.

The deadly incident came as Israel has been carrying out near-daily attacks on Lebanon despite [a ceasefire reached](/news/2024/11/26/ceasefire-between-lebanons-hezbollah-and-israel-what-to-know)
 with Hezbollah in November.

It also coincides with a United Nations Security Council vote to wind down a UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has for decades been tasked with maintaining a buffer between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces.

The [mandate](/news/2025/8/28/un-security-council-renews-unifil-mission-in-lebanon-until-end-of-2026)
 for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was extended through the end of 2026, but after that, the UN will carry out an “orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal” over the following year.

The resolution aims to make Lebanon’s military “the sole provider of security” in southern Lebanon, a goal complicated by Israel’s continued presence in the country. Both Israel and its top ally, the United States, have been pushing to end the UNIFIL mission.

“The process of withdrawing its 10,800 military and civilian personnel and equipment would start immediately in consultation with the Lebanese government, to be completed within a year,” Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr explained.

The US has also been pressuring Lebanon’s government to agree to a plan to disarm Hezbollah – something the Lebanese group has rejected, stressing that such a move will only reward Israel.

On a visit to Beirut on Tuesday, US envoy [Tom Barrack](/news/2025/8/28/us-envoy-says-calling-lebanon-reporters-animalistic-was-inappropriate)
 said Lebanon had agreed to present a plan aimed at persuading Hezbollah to disarm while Israel would submit a corresponding framework for its military withdrawal from the country.

Barrack said the plan, which is expected to be presented on Sunday, will not involve military coercion but focus on efforts to encourage Hezbollah to surrender its weapons.

A day earlier, Hezbollah Secretary-General [Naim Qassem said](/news/2025/8/25/hezbollah-chief-rejects-disarmament-demands-israel-comply-with-ceasefire)
 the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the ceasefire before talks on a national defence strategy could take place.

“If you truly want sovereignty, then stop the aggression."

Content: "(IRIB screenshot)

In an apparent first, an Israeli Air Force drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran overnight, the Israeli military and Iranian media said.

Footage broadcast by Iran’s state broadcaster IRIB on Wednesday morning showed what appeared to be a crashed Israeli Air Force Hermes 900.

“During operational activity, a surface-to-air missile was launched at an air force unmanned aerial vehicle,” the Israel Defense Forces said later, confirming the drone crashed in Iran.

The IDF said that “there is no fear of information leaking.”

The IAF has been operating over Iran, at a distance of more than 1,500 kilometers from Israel, since early Friday.

The military says it has air supremacy over western Iran and Tehran, and is working to extend it to other parts of the country, to thwart Iranian ballistic missile attacks on Israel.

More than 70 Iranian air defense batteries have been destroyed in strikes so far, according to the IDF.

> Video of wreckage of an Isralei Hermes drone shot down by the Iranian air defense in the Isfahan province this morning. We are constantly engaged in the struggle to maintain air superiority,” the military said.

The IDF said the incident over Isfahan was being investigated further.

The military has denied previous Iranian claims of shooting down Israeli aircraft, which were not backed by any evidence.

Several Hermes drones were [downed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-downs-idf-drone-over-south-lebanon-fires-heavy-rockets-at-north/)
 during the war with Iran’s proxy Hezbollah terror group.

Now in its sixth day, the Israeli operation in Iran was launched Friday with the objective of removing the “existential threat” of the Iranian nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities.

Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran’s top military leaders, nuclear scientists, uranium enrichment sites, and ballistic missile program is necessary to prevent the Islamic Republic from realizing its avowed plan to destroy the Jewish state.

Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. [Skip to main content](#main-content)
