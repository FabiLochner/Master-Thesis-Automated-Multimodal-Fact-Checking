## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." (![image 2335](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598606-937437.jpg))

The claim originated on a pro-Russian Telegram channel and was later reposted without any mention of it being a joke. The Forbes article mentions Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former Ukrainian four-star general, as one of the individuals named in the claims. (![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg))
