Useful result: From [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/): 
Content: The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Houthis claimed to have shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper in the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen on December 28, 2024. The Houthis also claimed to have downed a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The Houthis use Iranian weapon systems or technology, such as the Sayyad-2C missile. The article also mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen): 
Content: NPR reports that Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The article was published on April 25, 2025, and was written by The Associated Press. <image:20> The U.S. has been using warships, fighter jets, bombers, and drones to strike the Houthis.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission): 
Content: The CNN article, published on April 25, 2025, discusses the Houthis successfully shooting down at least seven US drones, hindering the US military campaign against the group in Yemen. <image:i>. The article mentions that the US launched a major military campaign on March 15, 2025, and has since conducted over 300 airstrikes. The Houthis have launched numerous missiles and drones at US forces and Israel. The article also notes that the US has spent nearly $1 billion on the operation in the first three weeks.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the evidence does not confirm the use of Russian missiles or the location of the image. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis used Iranian weapon systems or technology to down the drones, and NPR and CNN confirm that the Houthis have shot down US Reaper drones.

So, the overall veracity is: false
