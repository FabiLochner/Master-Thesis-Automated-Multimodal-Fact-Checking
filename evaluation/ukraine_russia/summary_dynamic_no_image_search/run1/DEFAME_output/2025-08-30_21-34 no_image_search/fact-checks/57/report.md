## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that Donald Trump did not criticize Keir Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine in an interview with Theo Von in August 2024. One source discusses an AI-generated audio recording of Trump criticizing Starmer, overlaid on a video interview with Theo Von on August 21, 2024, but neither Trump nor Von discussed the UK or Ukraine in the original video. Another source confirms that Trump did not make such a criticism. A Yahoo article about the interview does not mention Keir Starmer or a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine. ![image 1220](media/2025-08-06_18-35-1754505335-902827.jpg)
