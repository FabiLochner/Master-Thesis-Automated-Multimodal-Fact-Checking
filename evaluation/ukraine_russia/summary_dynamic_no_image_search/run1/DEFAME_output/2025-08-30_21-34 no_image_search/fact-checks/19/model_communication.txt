Ukraine allies criticise G20 statement for not naming Russia’s role in conflict
===============================================================================

Scholz, Starmer, Trudeau and Macron among leaders who say communique finalized by Lula ‘not strong enough’

[Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
’s western allies have criticised the final [G20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20)
 communique as inadequate for failing to highlight [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
’s invasion of its neighbour in 2022 as the conflict enters its 1,000th day.

The final agreed text from the summit in [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil)
 was significantly weaker than [that of the previous year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/09/g20-leaders-agree-joint-declaration-after-deal-on-ukraine-statement)
, only highlighting humanitarian suffering in Ukraine and the importance of territorial integrity.

The Ukrainian president, [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, accused G20 leaders of failing to act after his Russian counterpart, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, signed a decree easing Moscow’s rules for using nuclear weapons.

“Today, G20 countries are sitting in [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil)
. Starmer himself used a more diplomatic tone, saying it was important to include language on sovereignty but conceding that directly blaming Moscow was difficult while Russia was still part of the discussions.

Putin did not attend the summit in Rio de Janeiro for the third year running, but his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was at the meeting.

The weaker language will be a blow to Starmer, who spoke repeatedly about “doubling down on support for Ukraine” and said ahead of the summit that it was the top item on his agenda.

[Justin Trudeau](https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau)
, Canada’s prime minister, told reporters that G7 nations and “advanced economies” felt a much stronger statement was needed to reflect the “illegal invasion” of Ukraine by Russia. We would compare it to the G7 statement at the weekend, which reiterated our strong and unwavering support for Ukraine, and I think as that statement said, Russia remains the sole obstacle to a just and lasting peace.”

Starmer said he had used “every opportunity” both in the main sessions and in bilateral meetings during the summit to make clear “what we need to do to double down”.

----------- It fell short of the position we could have had,” the French president, [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron)
, told reporters on Monday night.

“This does not change anything in France’s position: it is a war of aggression launched by Russia against Ukraine, and our priority today is to obtain a lasting peace.”

In London, a No 10 spokesman said the lack of explicit language about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “not unexpected, given the G20 brings together a range of countries who have differing views. He said the final wording reflected the broader perspective of the G20 has broader perspectives, but said: “It’s not strong enough for me.”

Trudeau, whose government is bracing for a possible shift in relations following the re-election of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
, said the summit came “at a particularly challenging time in the world, for geopolitics but also for citizens all around the world”, because of inflation, war and climate change.

In such circumstances, finding consensus on the [G20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20)
 statement at the summit has proved especially challenging.

Communiques are typically issued at the end of a meeting, but Brazil’s president, [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva)
, came under fire for approving a final text a day early, while leaders of France, Germany and the United States were allegedly not in the room.

“The communique was closed by President Lula. Nothing,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference, accusing the G20 of failing to form a “strong strategy”.

[Olaf Scholz](https://www.theguardian.com/world/olaf-scholz)
, the chancellor of Germany, said he was disappointed that the communique did not make any reference to Russia’s role in starting the conflict.

“It is too little when the G20 cannot find the words to make it clear [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 is responsible,” he said at his press conference.

A spokesman for [Keir Starmer](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer)
, the UK’s prime minister, said the shift in language was “disappointing but not surprising”. Not least it includes representatives of the Russian government in attendance."

​​​​​​​**LONDON**

The Italian Prime Minister said Tuesday she understands the US approval of the use of long-range missiles for Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice, according to Italian news agency, ANSA.

Giorgia Meloni told reporters at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that the US decision was a "response" to Russia's war against Ukraine.

She said, however, that Italy pledges "support" for Ukraine as long as there is a war there.

US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response that the use of Western missiles by Ukraine may be considered an attack by a non-nuclear state with nuclear support, potentially justifying Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

Moscow has revised its nuclear doctrine, reducing the barriers to deploying nuclear weapons in a conflict. 

"We have always been focused on the issue of anti-aircraft defense," said Meloni. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House on February 28, 2025. The NPR and Al Jazeera articles describe a "heated meeting" and an "abrupt end" to the visit. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The specific statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not mentioned in the search results.

A fresh wave of disinformation targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has surged online, accusing him of being corrupt and prolonging the war. From February 18 to February 24, 2025, NewsGuard identified about 27,600 social media posts and articles mentioning "Zelenskyy" alongside terms like "villa," "yacht," "winery," or "mansion" — a 2,524% increase from the previous six-day period, which saw just 1,050 such mentions. It has been falsely claimed that Zelenskyy swore at Trump and demanded US troops fight in Ukraine.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy Donald Trump White House February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "[2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)" describes a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>. The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025.

NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about an abrupt end to a White House visit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) <image:517>. Al Jazeera also published an article on February 28, 2025, detailing a heated meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The articles mention disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House on February 28, 2025. The NPR and Al Jazeera articles describe a "heated meeting" and an "abrupt end" to the visit. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The specific statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not mentioned in the search results.


## Actions
```
web_search("Zelenskyy \"send their sons and daughters\" Trump February 2025")
```

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "[2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)" describes a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>. The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025.

NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about an abrupt end to a White House visit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) <image:517>. Al Jazeera also published an article on February 28, 2025, detailing a heated meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The articles mention disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House on February 28, 2025. The NPR and Al Jazeera articles describe a "heated meeting" and an "abrupt end" to the visit. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The specific statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not mentioned in the search results.

“Zelenskyy now directly threatening us and claiming American sons and daughters will have to fight and die for Ukraine.”

[Source: Twitter, February 28, 2023](https://twitter.com/MonicaCrowley/status/1630727982196183040 "Source: Twitter, February 28, 2023 ")

False

On February 24, the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a press conference underscoring his belief that his country would emerge victorious.

But an edited excerpt of Zelenskyy’s comments has widely circulated online, with commentators claiming that the Ukrainian president expects American citizens will be sent to fight in the war.

In the viral 19-second video clip, Zelenskyy can be heard saying the following through simultaneous interpretation:

_“The U.S. will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war. will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending \[our\] sons and daughters to war. support for Ukraine, including a decision to send it 31 M1 Abrams battle tanks, is intended to help Ukraine “defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity,” and “is not an offensive threat to Russia.”

This isn't the first time manipulated video has been disseminated to show Zelenskyy in an unfavorable light or undermine Ukraine's war effort.

In November, 2022, [Polygraph.info reported](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-misleading-video-falsely-portrays-zelenskyy-as-threatening-war-he-said-just-the-opposite-/6820594.html)
 how comments by Zelenskyy, in which he stressed his desire to end the war and bring peace to his country, were selectively edited to falsely portray the Ukrainian leader as threatening war.

No, Zelenskyy Did Not Say American Sons and Daughters Will Have to Die in Ukraine

#### Monica Crowley

Host of the Monica Crowley Podcast and a former U.S. assistant secretary of the treasury, [retweeted](https://twitter.com/monicacrowley/status/1630727982196183040?s=46&t=MkWuMjIrkku9SokUO8Tqvg)
 the clip with the following commentary:

_“Zelensky now directly threatening us and claiming American sons and daughters will have to fight and die for Ukraine. HELL NO”_

Others have offered similar assessments.

The claim that Zelenskyy said the United States would have to send its citizens to “fight and die in Ukraine” is false.

The edited clip removes the context from Zelenskyy’s statement, which concerned a hypothetical situation in which Ukraine loses the war and Russia moves against members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a 30-member military alliance of which the U.S. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) <image:9019>

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "[2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)" describes a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>. The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025.

NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about an abrupt end to a White House visit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) <image:517>. Al Jazeera also published an article on February 28, 2025, detailing a heated meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The articles mention disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House on February 28, 2025. The NPR and Al Jazeera articles describe a "heated meeting" and an "abrupt end" to the visit. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The specific statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not mentioned in the search results.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of India published an article on March 7, 2025, about disinformation following the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, including false claims that Zelenskyy demanded US troops fight in Ukraine ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms)). The Associated Press and Voice of America fact-checked claims that Zelenskyy said Americans would have to send their sons and daughters to war in Ukraine, finding them false. The Voice of America article, published on March 2, 2023, clarifies that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023 ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) <image:9019>.


# Your Analysis

Leaders in Europe joined in the call for continued support for Ukraine.

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)
, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

[!U.S. We're trying to solve a problem."

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

### Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers. 

"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., [said in a statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/28/leader-jeffries-statement-on-white-house-meeting-with-president-zelensky/)

An earlier headline incorrectly said President Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "ungrateful." Trump said Zelenskyy was "not acting at all thankful."

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled."

===================================================================================

The bitter exchange was unlike any other in the Oval Office in modern times.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

February 28, 2025, 4:00 PM

With Ukraine's future in the balance, a high-stakes meeting on Friday between President [Donald Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a shouting match.

The stunning exchange, before cameras and one unlike any other in the Oval Office in modern times, saw Trump and Vice President JD Vance rebuke Zelenskyy for his handling of the war, again falsely blaming the Ukrainian leader for a conflict that began when Russia's Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to sign an agreement that would give the U.S. But that was before boiling tensions exploded into public view as Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being "disrespectful" toward the [United States](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/us-military)
 and the Trump administration.

"He made it hard for the American people to believe he is a good investment," he added. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as well as other Democratic and Republican senators, gathered for an hourlong "encouraging" meeting with Zelenskyy ahead of his visit to the White House, the three lawmakers posted on their social media accounts.

Graham said he urged Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting with Trump not to "take the bait," but he wasn't the only one, sources told ABC News. They noted that Graham was very blunt, telling Zelenskyy to "suck up a bit" and thank the president extensively.

But senators on both sides of the aisle tried to provide Zelenskyy with "friendly coaching," according to two people who were in the room during the bipartisan meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

During a contentious Oval Office meeting on Friday, Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/jd-vance)
 accused Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 of campaigning for former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris)
 during the 2024 presidential race.

_Newsweek_ reached out to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment via email.

Why It Matters
--------------

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, on February 24, 2022. It spurred investigations from House Republicans about whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars.

"The Committee is investigating any coordination or communication among the  
Biden-Harris Administration, Pennsylvania's Office of the Governor, and President Zelensky for use or solicitation of use of government property to politically benefit Vice President Harris's presidential campaign," Representative James Comer, Kentucky [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 who leads the House Oversight Committee, wrote in a letter to the White House.

, with Vance raising concerns about Zelensky's visit to Pennsylvania last year.

Left to right, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance attend a fiery meeting in the Oval Office regarding Ukrainian minerals on February 28. Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who is trying to save your country," Vance said.

His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time.

Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, of Missouri, wrote on X at the time that Zelensky was "campaigning for [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats)
 in battleground Pennsylvania today some 50 days out from our Presidential election."

Zelensky also faced criticism around that time for describing Vance as "too radical" in an interview with _The New Yorker._

Sept. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Vaughn Hillyard, Kyle Stewart, Olympia Sonnier and Monica Alba contributed. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. “Everything is going to be on the table,” he said.

Republicans criticized Zelenskyy for traveling to a swing state and being seen alongside Democrats there.

“It was a real tactical misstep on Zelenskyy’s part to appear at that Scranton arsenal alongside Casey and Cartwright, because it looks like he’s joining a whistle-stop tour on their re-election,” said Reid Smith, vice president of foreign policy at Stand Together, a nonprofit libertarian organization founded by Charles Koch. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept."

Content: "President Donald Trump said Monday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wanted “so badly” for Vice President Kamala Harris to win the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

“I see Zelenskyy is here, I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history,” Trump [said at a rally in Pennsylvania.](https://www.youtube.com/live/92ZhB1tNuCQ?si=DA4e3HftrD7eRhte)

Zelenskyy on Sunday visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania — a critical swing state in November’s knife-edge election — as part of a tour to shore up support for Kyiv’s resistance against Russia’s war, providing a fillip to the Harris campaign, which riled Trump.

“Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion … He wants them \[the Democrats\] to win this election so badly, but I would do it differently, I will work out peace,” Trump said.

The Republican candidate added that if he wins the election, “the first thing I’m gonna do is call up Zelenskyy and call up President Putin and I’m gonna say, ‘You gotta make a deal, this is crazy.’”

Trump has repeatedly vowed to negotiate an end to the conflict, though he has declined to give further details and [wouldn’t say](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/11/trump-ukraine-foreign-policy-approach-00178595)
 whether he wanted Ukraine to defeat Russia when pressed at the presidential debate with Harris earlier this month. Biden [beat](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/pennsylvania/)
 Trump in Pennsylvania in 2020 by about 80,000 votes.

Harris recently hired Filip Jotevski as a “national diaspora and ethnic engagement director.” And a giant fundraising group supporting Harris [produced an ad](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 posted on Facebook specifically targeting Polish voters.  

Republicans have also been targeting the Poles of Pennsylvania.

Trump was initially supposed to meet Polish President Andrzej Duda on Sunday in Pennsylvania, where they would attend the unveiling of a new memorial to the Polish anti-communist workers’ “Solidarity” movement. Long wary of Moscow, Warsaw has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies since Putin launched his full-scale invasion.

Zelenskyy’s trip to Pennsylvania is a boon for Harris, who has sought to use U.S. He has also [threatened](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/)

.

The Republican candidate did post a [congratulatory message](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113181668600678553)
 to Polish Americans on his Truth Social platform, and Duda urged the diaspora to vote — without an endorsement: “Our political strength, your votes cast in American elections, decide the future of America but also the future of Poland,” he said, per [TVP World](https://tvpworld.com/82462537/president-duda-calls-on-polish-americans-to-vote-in-us-presidential-election)
.

Zelenskyy is slated to meet with Trump in the coming days after first speaking with U.S. President Joe Biden and Harris, and attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

While he avoided mentioning Trump by name, Zelenskyy said last Friday during an [interview](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-victory-sets-a-deadline-for-partners-speedy-and-strategic-steps-needed-from-today-and-until-december/)
 that if Western partners really want Ukraine to win the war they have to do everything they can to help Kyiv win “today, while all the officials who want the victory of Ukraine are in official positions.”

Zelenskyy’s office refused to confirm the swing state trip was chosen for any purpose other than “to pay a visit of gratitude” to the Scranton munitions factory, which manufactures shells used by Ukraine’s military.

“This is a key plant, they increased the 155 mm \[shells\] production specifically for us. aid to Ukraine.

During the debate, Harris tore into Trump over his stance on the war, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin “would be sitting in Kyiv right now” with Poland in his sights if Trump were in the Oval Office. And that would be logical to thank them,” a Ukrainian official close to the president told POLITICO on condition of anonymity, adding that Zelenskyy planned to visit a different state every time he goes to the U.S.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be "at war" with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons.

Zelenskyy’s visit to Pennsylvania weapons factory upsets speaker as Trump continues attacks on Ukrainian president

The US House speaker, [Mike Johnson](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-johnson)
, has demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington as the feud between Donald Trump and Volodymr Zelenskyy escalated and Republicans accused the Ukrainian leader of election interference.

In a public letter, [Johnson demanded that Zelenskyy fire the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1839022358360649796)
, over a visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, last week where the Ukrainian president thanked workers for providing desperately needed shells to his outgunned forces.

Johnson complained that Markarova had organised the visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant as a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats”. The event was attended by the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who has campaigned in support of Kamala Harris.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because – on purpose – no [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans)
 were invited,” Johnson wrote in a letter on congressional letterhead addressed to the Ukrainian embassy.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant on Sunday. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.”

The accusations against Zelenskyy came after a controversial interview with the New Yorker in which he questioned Trump’s plan to end Ukraine’s war with Russia and sharply criticized Republicans’ vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, as “too radical”.

Vance had earlier said a peace in Ukraine could entail Russia retaining the Ukrainian land it had occupied and the establishment a demilitarised zone with a heavily fortified frontline to prevent another Russian invasion.

“His message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice,” Zelenskyy said in the interview with the New Yorker. She should be removed from her post immediately.”

On the same day, Trump in a campaign event in North Carolina attacked Zelenskyy directly and accused him of “refusing” to negotiate a peace deal with Vladimir Putin.

“The president of [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)

, Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington to present his “victory plan” to Joe Biden at the White House.

In his letter, Johnson also referred to Ukrainian officials criticizing Trump and Vance in remarks to the media.

“Additionally, as I have clearly stated in the past, all foreign nations should avoid opining on or interfering in American domestic politics,” he said. “Support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested and needlessly tarnished when the candidates at the top of the Republican presidential ticket are targeted in the media by officials in your government.”

Other top Republicans had criticized Zelenskyy this week after his remarks about Trump and Vance were published.

“I don’t mind him going to a munitions plant thanking people for helping Ukraine."

### Evidence from `web_search`
JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race, according to a Newsweek article (<image:9064>, <image:9063>). The article mentions Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024, which Republican Senator Eric Schmitt criticized. NBC News also reported on Zelenskyy's visit to the munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election.

Politico reports that Donald Trump said Zelenskyy wanted Kamala Harris to win the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a critical swing state.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This visit was criticized by some Republicans, who viewed it as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election. JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. Donald Trump also stated that Zelenskyy wanted Kamala Harris to win the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris. However, the visit to Pennsylvania, a swing state, and the criticisms from Republicans suggest that the visit was perceived as a form of election interference.

To fully verify the claim, more information is needed to confirm whether Zelenskyy's actions were intended to influence the election and whether he explicitly campaigned for Kamala Harris.

Zelenskyy's trip to Pennsylvania sparked a flurry of criticism from representatives of the Republican Party. In addition, the plant was visited by Democrats Bob Casey and Matt Cartwright, who represent the Scranton constituency in the Senate and House of Representatives.

  

There were no Republican representatives at the event, which angered some Republicans.

  

**Zelenskyy and interference in the US elections**
--------------------------------------------------

  

On 25 September, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announced an investigation into Zelenskyy's visit to the plant to see if the purpose of the visit was to ‘interfere in the US election’.

  

At the same time, House Speaker Mike Johnson publicly called on Zelenskyy to fire Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova. He claims that she allegedly organised the visit and did not specifically invite Republicans.

  

‘The visit was obviously part of a political campaign to help Democrats and is a clear interference in the election,’ Johnson said.

**Trump did not stand aside**
-----------------------------

  

US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump also made several harsh statements against Zelenskyy, in particular, accusing the Ukrainian president of ‘dirty tricks’.

  

‘Zelenskyy is making dirty little attacks on your favourite president, me,’ Trump said.

  

**The consequences of the scandal are already being felt**
----------------------------------------------------------

  

Zelenskyy's trip to the US is very important for America's continued support for Ukraine. What is the essence of the scandal and what are its consequences already felt, we tell in this article

A scandal erupted during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the United States. Senior US politicians called on the Ukrainian leader to dismiss the Ukrainian ambassador, and Zelenskyy himself was accused of interfering in the US election. What happened, what statements have already been made, and what to expect next, we will tell you below.

  

**What is the reason for the scandal?**
---------------------------------------

  

On 23 September, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, during his visit to the United States. It can give one of the candidates 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed.

  

Zelenskyy visited the plant in the company of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is a popular figure in the Democratic Party and is also considered close to presidential candidate Kamala Harris. In addition, Zelenskyy planned to address the US Congress.

  

However, during the visit, plans began to change dramatically. Congress Speaker Mike Johnson said he would not be able to meet with Zelenskyy, allegedly ‘due to his workload’. He added that if the meeting did take place, he would discuss with Zelenskyy the situation with Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova."

Figures from Poland’s main opposition party, the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), have criticised Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky after he used his visit to Warsaw to aim apparent criticism at PiS’s presidential candidate and present an award to the main ruling party’s candidate.

They have accused him of “brazen interference” in the campaign for [May’s presidential election](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/01/08/dates-of-polish-presidential-election-announced/)

The Ukrainian president’s words and actions during his visit prompted criticism from PiS politicians, who accused him of interfering in the campaign for May’s presidential election.

“Volodymyr Zelensky is brazenly engaged in the election campaign in Poland on the side of the pro-German Rafał Trzaskowski and attacks Karol Nawrocki, who is a Polish politician and defends Polish interests,” tweeted PiS MP Janusz Kowalski.

Last week, Karol Nawrocki, whose bid for the presidency is supported by PiS, [said](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/01/09/opposition-presidential-candidate-cant-currently-envision-ukraine-in-nato-and-opposes-ending-abortion-ban/)
 that he “does not envision Ukraine in the EU or NATO” until it resolves issues relating to the [Volhynia massacres](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/07/15/controversial-memorial-to-victims-of-wwii-massacres-by-ukrainian-nationalists-unveiled-in-poland/)
, in which Ukrainian nationalists killed around 100,000 ethnic Poles during World War Two.

That prompted an angry response from Kyiv, where the foreign ministry immediately [issued a statement](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/01/10/poland-announces-breakthrough-on-exhumation-of-ww2-massacre-victims-in-ukraine/)
 accusing Nawrocki of making “manipulative” and “unacceptable” claims that “contribute to the hostile efforts” by Russia to “destroy Ukrainian-Polish friendship and mutual understanding”.

On Wednesday, during a visit to Warsaw to meet with Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda, Zelensky addressed Nawrocki’s remarks when asked about them by the Polish media.

“If Ukraine is not in the EU and is not in NATO, if Ukraine does not have a guarantee of security, then Mr Nawrocki should start training already, because it may turn out that he will have to take up arms to defend his country together with his compatriots,” said the Ukrainian president.

“After Ukraine, Russia will be on Poland’s border and then \[Nawrocki\] will not have political contests, he will be fighting for his life,” continued Zelensky.

Earlier in the day, Zelensky had met with Rafał Trzaskowski, who is the mayor of Warsaw but also the [presidential candidate of Tusk’s centrist Civic Coalition](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/11/23/main-polish-ruling-party-names-rafal-trzaskowski-as-presidential-candidate-after-primary-election/)
 (KO). A Ukrainian comedian cannot interfere in the Polish presidential elections.”

> Wołodymyr Zełenski bezczelnie angażuje się w kampanię wyborczą w Polsce po stronie proniemieckiego Rafała Trzaskowskiego i atakuje Karola Nawrockiego, który jest polskim politykiem i broni polskich interesów. Nie ma miejsca dla Ukrainy w UE.

Trzaskowski himself was also asked about Zelensky’s remarks and whether they constituted him taking sides in the ongoing election campaign.

“Above all, I would like no one in Poland to get involved in the campaign on Putin’s side,” said Trzaskowski, quoted by the _Rzeczpospolita_ daily."

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris. However, the visit to Pennsylvania, a swing state, and the criticisms from Republicans suggest that the visit was perceived as a form of election interference.

To fully verify the claim, more information is needed to confirm whether Zelenskyy's actions were intended to influence the election and whether he explicitly campaigned for Kamala Harris.

Zelenskyy with NATO secretary general [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg")
 in June 2019

During the 2019 presidential campaign, Zelenskyy promised bills to fight [corruption](/wiki/Corruption_in_Ukraine "Corruption in Ukraine")
, including removal of immunity from the [president](/wiki/President_of_Ukraine "President of Ukraine")
, [members](/wiki/People%27s_Deputy_of_Ukraine "People's Deputy of Ukraine")
 of the [Verkhovna Rada](/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada "Verkhovna Rada")
 (Ukraine's national parliament) and judges, a law about impeachment, reform of election laws, and providing efficient trial by jury. He promised to bring the salary for military personnel "to the level of [NATO](/wiki/NATO "NATO")
 standards."[\[349\]](#cite_note-353)

Although Zelenskyy had earlier stated that he prefers elections with [open list](/wiki/Open_list "Open list")
 election ballots (such as in his inauguration speech[\[114\]](#cite_note-inaugurationspeech-118)
), after he called the snap [2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election](/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election "2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election")
, his draft law "On amendments to some laws of Ukraine in connection with the change of the electoral system for the election of people's deputies" proposed to hold the election with closed lists because the 60-day term to the snap election did not "leave any chances for the introduction of this system."[\[115\]](#cite_note-UPclosedlistsrejected-119)
 However, this bill was rejected by parliament.[\[113\]](#cite_note-uawireclosedlists-117)

Zelenskyy and Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](/wiki/Narendra_Modi "Narendra Modi")
 at the [COP26 climate summit](/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference "United Nations Climate Change conference")
 in Glasgow, November 2021

Zelenskyy opposed targeting the Russian language in Ukraine and banning artists for their political opinions (such as those viewed by the Government as [anti-Ukrainian](/wiki/Anti-Ukrainian_sentiment "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment")
).[\[350\]](#cite_note-354)
[\[351\]](#cite_note-355)
 In April 2019, he stated that he was not against a [Ukrainian language](/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language")
 quota ([on radio and TV](/wiki/Ukrainization#Mass_media "Ukrainization")
), although he noted they could be tweaked.[\[352\]](#cite_note-/7212672/_Zelensky-356)
 He also said that Russian artists "who have turned into (anti-Ukrainian) politicians" should remain banned from entering Ukraine.[\[339\]](#cite_note-3daysbUpeZi-343)

In response to a petition demanding equal rights for same-sex couples, Zelenskyy affirmed that democracies were measured by how they ensure equal rights for all citizens, that "all people are free and equal in their dignity and rights",[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
 and that the family "consists of persons who live together, are connected by common life, have mutual rights and obligations";[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 he asked the [Prime Minister of Ukraine](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Ukraine "Prime Minister of Ukraine")
 to review [civil partnerships](/wiki/Civil_union "Civil union")
 for same-sex couples and called this "part of the work on establishing and ensuring human rights and freedoms".[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 However, he said that [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage")
 could not be introduced during wartime as this would require amending the Constitution of Ukraine, which defines marriage as "based on the free consent of a woman and a man", and the Constitution cannot be changed during martial law.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
[\[355\]](#cite_note-359)
[\[356\]](#cite_note-blade-360)
 Civil rights organizations such as [Kyiv Pride](/wiki/Kyiv_Pride "Kyiv Pride")
 praised the statement,[\[356\]](#cite_note-blade-360)
 though [Holos](/wiki/Holos_(political_party) "Holos (political party)")
 MP [Inna Sovsun](/wiki/Inna_Sovsun "Inna Sovsun")
 criticised the lack of details about legal proposals for civil partnerships.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)

On 2 December 2022, Zelenskyy said his administration would enter a bill in the Verkhovna Rada that would ban "religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation", referring to the [Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)](/wiki/Ukrainian_Orthodox_Church_(Moscow_Patriarchate) "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)")
 (UOC-MP), from operating in Ukraine.[\[357\]](#cite_note-361)
 The bill was passed by parliament and signed by Zelenskyy in August 2024,[\[358\]](#cite_note-uocmp-362)
 after opposition parties protested the bill's delay.[\[359\]](#cite_note-uocmpdelay-363)
 The law treats each parish individually and gives it nine months to cut ties with the UOC-MP, following which a special commission will inspect individual parishes and file lawsuits against non-compliant ones; the court can then decide on a ban in each case.[\[360\]](#cite_note-uocmpexplain-364)

White House official: Secondary sanctions coming on Friday

A White House official says US envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin today went well, but Washington is still planning to impose secondary sanctions on Friday, Donald Trump's deadline for Vladimir Putin to end the war.

Secondary sanctions are designed to prevent third parties from trading with countries subject to sanctions. 

The official added that Russia was "eager" to continue engaging with the US.

In the meantime, Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have reportedly ended their call now.

Rubio says US to decide on Russia sanctions soon

The US secretary of state said he had spoken to special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is on his way back from a trip to Russia, and would have more discussions throughout the day. 

He told reporters there would hopefully be some announcements soon: "Maybe positive, maybe not." 

The Kremlin said Witkoff held "useful and constructive" talks with Vladimir Putin today, two days before the expiry of a deadline set by Donald Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.

India: US tariffs 'unfair, unjustified and unreasonable'

Tariffs placed on India by the US over its imports of Russian oil are "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable", New Delhi's foreign ministry says.

Donald Trump earlier issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India over its continued imports of Russian (see 15.10 post).

The US president said he believed declining global energy prices could pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

In a statement, the Indian government labelled Trump's decision as "unfortunate", adding it will take "all actions necessary" to protect its national interests.

It says the country's imports are "based on market factors" and done with the objective of "ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people".

Ukraine war latest: Trump gives update on US-Putin talks - after doubling India tariffs in oil row
==================================================================================================

Donald Trump has hit India with new tariffs for buying Russian oil, while his envoy has held talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, two days before the US president's deadline for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Russia must end the war that it itself started. Thank you to everyone who stands with Ukraine."

'Russia isn't serious about Trump's deadline'

As we've mentioned, it appears the US will impose secondary sanctions on Russia on Friday - but is Moscow taking Washington seriously on its threats?

America's former ambassador to Ukraine says he's seen nothing from Trump in his seven months in office that would suggest he'd actually apply any serious sanctions on Moscow.

"The problem is that Trump set in the spring, maybe three times, deadlines of two weeks," Steven Pifer told [chief presenter Mark Austin](https://news.sky.com/author/mark-austin-983)
.

"Each time, the Russians did nothing to meet the deadline and Trump did nothing in terms of punitive measures against Moscow, so I'm not sure how serious they're treating this Friday deadline."

Pifer says that Vladimir Putin has consistently tried to portray himself as being prepared to engage with peace talks "without making any real compromise".

"I think what Putin is trying to do is string Trump along while he continues to let the Russian military do its thing against the Ukrainians on the ground."

Instead of placing tariffs on countries like India who still purchase Russian oil, Pifer says the best course of action to hurt Moscow would be to seize the nearly $300bn in frozen Russian assets and make those funds available for Ukraine. 

"That would signal to Putin that Ukraine will have the funding to continue this war for five, six, seven years."

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That is down from 90 percent in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52 percent in December 2024. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address."

Top Questions

### 

When did the Russia-Ukraine War begin?

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, was the expansion of a war between the two countries that had begun in February 2014, when disguised Russian troops [covertly invaded and took control](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukraine-crisis#ref323583)
 of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of [Crimea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crimea)
. It also estimated Ukrainian military casualties since 2022 to be 400,000, including an estimated 60,000–100,000 soldiers killed.

### 

Why did Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine in 2022?

[Vladimir Putin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Putin)
’s invasion followed years of tension between [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)
 and [Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine)
 as Ukraine moved toward closer ties with the West, which Putin viewed as a threat to Russia’s influence. The overwhelming majority of these casualties, which were verified by UN personnel, occurred in Ukraine.

### 

How has Russia’s war against Ukraine affected Ukraine’s population?

More than eight million people fled Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion, and a similar number were internally displaced. In March 2023 the International Criminal Court concluded that Russia’s mass kidnapping campaign constituted a war crime.

Russia’s [destruction of Kakhovka Dam](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine/The-Ukrainian-counterattack#ref374607)
 on the Dnipro River in June 2023 is also an example of how Russian forces have attacked Ukrainian infrastructure to inflict suffering on Ukraine’s population: some 240 square miles (620 square km) of territory were flooded, scores of people died, and dozens of towns were inundated, with up to 1 million people left without drinking water.

### 

How has the war in Ukraine impacted Russia’s military capabilities?

Russia’s visually confirmed losses as of early 2024 totaled more than 8,000 armored vehicles, including some 2,700 tanks. In recognition of Russia’s continued hybrid warfare campaign against Ukraine, the framework called for mediated talks between the two governments rather than any attempts at bilateral engagement.

Content: "Putin responded by invading Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

Second, the Biden administration has reacted to the outbreak of the war by doubling down against Russia. In response, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbass between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government.

One often hears the argument that in the eight years between when the crisis broke out in February 2014 and when the war began in February 2022, the United States and its allies paid little attention to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point succinctly at a press conference on January 14th, 2022, when he said, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”

Nevertheless, the efforts of Lavrov and Putin to get the United States and its allies to abandon their efforts to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border failed completely. The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine War
==============================================

_**! We live in perilous times.

Let me now lay out my argument in greater detail, starting with a description of the conventional wisdom about the causes of the conflict.

The Conventional Wisdom

It is widely and firmly believed in the West that Putin is solely responsible for causing the Ukraine crisis and certainly the ongoing war. In his July 12th, 2021, article about Russian-Ukrainian relations, which proponents of the conventional wisdom often point to as evidence of his imperial ambitions, he tells the Ukrainian people, “You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!” Regarding how Russia should treat Ukraine, he writes, “There is only one answer: with respect.” He concludes that lengthy article with the following words: “And what Ukraine will be—it is up to its citizens to decide.” It is hard to reconcile these statements with the claim that he wants to incorporate Ukraine within a greater Russia.

In that same July 12th, 2021 article and again in an important speech he gave on February 21st, 2022, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts “the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.” He reiterated that same point for a third time on February 24th, 2022, when he announced that Russia would invade Ukraine. In short, Russia did not have the capability to subdue all of Ukraine, much less conquer other countries in Eastern Europe.

To take this argument a step further, Putin and other Russian leaders surely understand from the Cold War that occupying counties in the age of nationalism is invariably a prescription for never-ending trouble. Let me now turn to the real cause of the Ukraine crisis.

The Real Cause of the Crisis

The taproot of the crisis is the American-led effort to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s borders. From his perspective, that would be a declaration of war.”

The Bush administration, which was pushing such a decision for NATO however, cared little about Moscow’s “brightest of red lines” and pressured the French and German leaders to agree to issuing a public pronouncement that said unequivocally that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually join the alliance.

Unsurprisingly, the American-led effort to integrate Georgia into NATO resulted in a war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008—just four months after the Bucharest summit. He made a series of moves—like shutting down pro-Russian TV stations and arresting an especially close friend of Putin and charging him with treason—that were sure to anger Moscow.

President Biden, who moved into the White House in January 2021, had long been committed to bringing Ukraine into NATO and was also super-hawkish towards Russia."

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

From [Source](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/): 
Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Amazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break Ukraine’s democracy.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

Ukraine's air force on Sunday confirmed that a third Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot had been killed in action, a unwelcome blow for a military with a limited number of fourth-generation Western jets and a small pool of pilots trained to fly them.

Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Ustimenko intercepted seven incoming Russian air targets in his F-16 jet before his aircraft was damaged and started to lose altitude, Ukraine's air force said in a statement on Sunday.

He is the third known F-16 pilot to be killed while operating the U.S.-made aircraft, which Ukraine has been using for little under a year.

Kyiv had long clamored for donations of the Lockheed Martin-manufactured F-16s to boost its Soviet-era aircraft while staring down Russia's more advanced—and much more numerous—fleet that has taken far fewer hits in the war than Moscow's land forces.

Ukrainian Air Force F-16 fighter jets fly over an undisclosed location in Ukraine on August 4, 2024. Losing pilots is also a painful prospect, he told _Newsweek_.

In late August, just weeks after Kyiv confirmed it was operating the first of its donated jets, Ukraine said Oleksiy Mes — a famed pilot also known by his call sign, Moonfish — had died while "repelling a massive Russian combined air and missile attack."

A second F-16 was shot down over the northeastern Sumy region in mid-April this year, killing its 26-year-old pilot, Pavlo Ivanov.

The following month, the air force said it had lost communication with an F-16 intercepting Russian attacks, but that the pilot had managed to eject from the aircraft. Ustimenko "mastered four types of aircraft, and his record includes truly significant achievements for Ukraine," the Ukrainian leader said in his evening address.

Kyiv's military reported in the early hours of Sunday that Russia had launched hundreds of drones and decoys at the country overnight, as well as various different types of missiles. Languages: English, Spanish.You can reach Ellie via email at [e.cook@newsweek.com](mailto:e.cook@newsweek.com)

Newsweek AI is in beta. Ukrainian Air Force F-16 fighter jets fly over an undisclosed location in Ukraine on August 4, 2024. Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's chief of staff, said Moscow had "struck energy facilities, infrastructure, and residential areas."

Ukraine has repeatedly used its F-16 fighter jets, as well French-made Mirage 2000 aircraft Kyiv received in early 2025, to intercept Russian attacks on the country.

"This loss and earlier losses clearly point at the dangers of intercepting low-flying targets at close range with low-flying aircraft," Mertens said, adding the drive to "do the utmost and take serious risks" when in the air can be especially strong when trying to shield civilians and residential buildings.

It's not clear exactly how many of the approximately 85 F-16s committed by Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium are now being used by Ukraine.

Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's defense minister, said in February that Denmark had "already delivered most of the promised F-16s, with the remaining ones to arrive soon." Umerov's Danish counterpart, Troels Lund Poulsen, said shortly after that Copenhagen had transferred 12 out of the 19 jets it had promised Ukraine.

It's not immediately apparent whether the remaining seven jets have been delivered. Standing next to Zelensky during a press conference in April in the Ukrainian capital, the Belgian prime minister said Brussels would send two F-16s for spare parts in 2025 and two more aircraft the following year.

Belgium's current defense minister, Theo Francken, said in May Brussels "would try to deliver the aircraft even earlier," according to remarks reported by the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty outlet. Her work focuses largely on the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. Search and rescue teams quickly located and evacuated the pilot, the military said.

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 said on Sunday he had ordered a full investigation into Ustimenko's death. Ignat told _Newsweek_ it was the highest number of aerial threats recorded since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022.

Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement it had launched a "massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons," including Kinzhal missiles, targeting Ukraine's military industry and the country's oil refineries."

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, June 29 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack that involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, authorities said on Sunday, as Moscow intensifies night-time air barrages in the [fourth year of war](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the pilot, Maksym Ustymenko, and bestowed upon him posthumously the title of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest decoration.

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Faerospace-defense%2Fleast-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29%2F)

He also called for more support from Washington and Western allies to bolster Ukraine's air defences after the attack, which damaged homes and infrastructure across the country and injured at least 12 people, according to local authorities.

In Kyiv, families huddled in metro stations for shelter after air raid sirens rung out. Kyiv has not revealed the size of its F-16 fleet, but they have become a central and heavily used part of Ukraine's defences.

The pilot flew the damaged jet away from a settlement but had no time to eject before it crashed, the Ukrainian Air Force said.

"The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude," the Air Force said on Telegram.

Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan, speaking earlier this month, said the F-16 was not ideally suited to all tasks in the war, particularly repelling drones which swarm Ukrainian cities, as it is better used against higher-speed targets.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said Ustymenko had been flying missions since the time of a campaign that began in 2014 against Russian-financed separatists who had seized parts of eastern Ukraine.

"He mastered four types of aircraft and had important results to his name in defending Ukraine," he said. Machine-gun fire and explosions were heard across the capital and in the western city of Lviv, where such attacks are less common.

The governor of the Lviv region, bordering Poland, said the raid targeted critical infrastructure.

Ukraine has now [lost](/world/europe/ukraine-pilot-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-lost-ukrainian-military-says-2025-06-29/)
 three F-16s since it began operating the U.S.-made jets last year. "It is painful to lose such people."

The Ukrainian military said in total Russia launched 477 drones and 60 missiles of various types to Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces destroyed 211 of the drones and 38 missiles, it said, while 225 more drones were either lost due to electronic warfare or were decoys that carried no explosives.

Writing earlier on X, Zelenskiy said: "Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes." He said Russia had launched around 114 missiles, 1,270 drones, and 1,100 glide bombs just in the past week.

Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency said one person was killed by a Ukrainian drone in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's Luhansk region. Both Ukraine and Russia say they do not attack civilian targets.

POLITICAL WILL
--------------

Ukraine says recent attacks highlight the need for further support from Washington, which under President Donald Trump has not committed to new military aid for Ukraine.

Trump said he was considering a Ukrainian request [for more Patriot missile, opens new tab](europe)
 batteries after he met Zelenskiy at a NATO summit last Wednesday.

"This war must be brought to an end - pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection," Zelenskiy said in his X post. "Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence - the thing that best protects lives."

He said Ukraine was ready to buy the American air defence systems and it counts on "leadership, political will, and the support of the United States, Europe, and all our partners."

Russia has launched large-scale strikes on Ukrainian cities every few days in recent weeks, causing widespread damage, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more.

During the latest barrage, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors said. One woman was injured in western Ivano-Frankivsk region.

Rescuers evacuated residents from apartment blocks in Cherkasy that had charred walls and broken windows.

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines. Makeshift signs and barriers warning people not to enter are a common sight on the edges of fields and forests and near roads.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the country “has made a difficult but necessary political decision” to withdraw from the Ottawa convention, saying the government was “convinced” it was necessary to do so.

At the start of this year, the pact had 165 member states – although several major powers, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the United States, have never signed up to it.

Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – which all border Russia – have also made moves to pull out of the treaty arguing they were essential for defense.

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Poland celebrated Armed Forces Day on August 15th, 2024, with a military parade. The parade was part of a four-day celebration. Flypasts were scheduled for August 14th and 15th.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024. While the evidence confirms military events around that date, it does not explicitly confirm the image's context.

To verify the claim, information is missing about the specific event depicted in the image and whether it was indeed a military parade on August 14, 2024.
