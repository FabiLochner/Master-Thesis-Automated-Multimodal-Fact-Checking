## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "[2025 Trumpâ€“Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)" describes a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>. The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025.

NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about an abrupt end to a White House visit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg). Al Jazeera also published an article on February 28, 2025, detailing a heated meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The articles mention disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House on February 28, 2025. The NPR and Al Jazeera articles describe a "heated meeting" and an "abrupt end" to the visit. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The specific statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not mentioned in the search results.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of India published an article on March 7, 2025, about disinformation following the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, including false claims that Zelenskyy demanded US troops fight in Ukraine ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms)). The Associated Press and Voice of America fact-checked claims that Zelenskyy said Americans would have to send their sons and daughters to war in Ukraine, finding them false. The Voice of America article, published on March 2, 2023, clarifies that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023 ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) ![image 9019](media/2025-08-30_21-44-1756590242-895698.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Fact-check articles from the Times of India, Associated Press, and Voice of America debunked the statement attributed to Zelenskyy. The Voice of America clarifies that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference in February 2023, not during the White House meeting in February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The initial search confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February 2025 but did not find evidence to support the specific quote. A subsequent search revealed that the claim was debunked by multiple fact-checkers, including the Associated Press and Voice of America. The Voice of America clarified that the statement was taken out of context from a 2023 press conference.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, the statement attributed to Zelenskyy was debunked by fact-checkers like the Associated Press and Voice of America. The Voice of America clarified that the statement was taken out of context from a 2023 press conference ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)).
