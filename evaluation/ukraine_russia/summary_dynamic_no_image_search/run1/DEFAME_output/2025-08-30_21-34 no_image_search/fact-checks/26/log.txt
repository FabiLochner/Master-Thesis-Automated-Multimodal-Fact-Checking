Useful result: From [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms): 
Content: The Times of India published an article on March 7, 2025, titled "Fact check: Disinformation spikes after Trump-Zelenskyy row." The article states that a fresh wave of disinformation targeting Zelenskyy has surged online, including false claims that Zelenskyy swore at Trump and demanded US troops fight in Ukraine. The article mentions a recent dispute in the Oval Office between Zelenskyy, US President Donald Trump, and vice president JD Vance.

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159): 
Content: The Associated Press published a fact check article stating that Zelenskyy did not say that Americans would have to send their sons and daughters to war in Ukraine. The article includes a photo of Zelenskyy.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html): 
Content: The Voice of America published an article on March 2, 2023, fact-checking a claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die in Ukraine. The article states that the claim is false and that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023. The original statement referred to a hypothetical situation where Russia attacks a NATO member. The article includes a tweet from Monica Crowley, who claimed Zelenskyy was threatening the U.S. <image:9019>.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, the statement attributed to Zelenskyy was debunked by fact-checkers like the Associated Press and Voice of America. The Voice of America clarified that the statement was taken out of context from a 2023 press conference ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
