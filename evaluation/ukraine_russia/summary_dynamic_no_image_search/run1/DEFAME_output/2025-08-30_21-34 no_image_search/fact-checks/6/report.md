There are also claims of F-16s shooting down Russian missiles and even a Russian Su-35S Flanker fighter. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the location (Black Sea) or the reason for the jet being shot down.

However, the claim's specific details, such as the location (Black Sea) and the reason for the jet being shot down, are not confirmed by the evidence.
