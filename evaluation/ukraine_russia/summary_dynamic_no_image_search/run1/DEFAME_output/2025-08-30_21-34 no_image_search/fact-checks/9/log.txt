Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-bringing-war-back-russia-zelenskyy-after-new/story?id=117408954): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on January 7, 2025, discusses the ongoing conflict in the Kursk region of Russia. It reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine is bringing the war "back to Russia" and that Russia has lost over 38,000 troops in the area since August. The article mentions a new Ukrainian offensive in the region, with fighting reported near Sudzha, which Ukraine captured in August. <image:3094> The article also mentions that the Ukrainian presence in Kursk may give Kyiv more leverage in peace talks with Moscow. The author of the article is David Brennan.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim, which shows Volodymyr Zelensky, was taken in May 2022 in the Kharkiv region, not in August 2024 in the Kursk region as the claim states. While there are reports of a Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, the image is misrepresented.

So, the overall veracity is: false
