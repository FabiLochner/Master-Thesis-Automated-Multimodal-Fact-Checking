Content: The Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) published on August 26, 2024, states that the claim that BlackRock asked Ukraine not to bury soldiers on its land is false. The AFCL cites a claim made by a Bulgarian politician, Plamen Paskov, which was shared by Russian and Chinese media. The AFCL states that BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine and that the claim has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations. <image:8882>

Useful result: From [Source](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military): 
Content: Detector Media states that propagandists spread the claim that BlackRock owns 47% of Ukraine's territory and asked not to bury soldiers on their lands. Detector Media found that the claim that BlackRock banned Ukraine from burying its military is wrong. In late 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyi held a meeting with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss projects for the country's recovery. In 2023, the Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund to attract private investment to restore the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military. The Georgian fact-checking portal Mythdetector found a recording from a Telegram channel that this claim is based on, which may be satirical or false.

The claim 'BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checkers, including the Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)), have debunked the claim, stating that BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
