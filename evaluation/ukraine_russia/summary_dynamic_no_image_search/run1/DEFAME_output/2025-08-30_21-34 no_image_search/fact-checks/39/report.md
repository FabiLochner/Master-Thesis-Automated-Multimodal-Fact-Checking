## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not definitively supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, the evidence presents conflicting information regarding the hit list.

Some sources, such as ABC News and Global News, do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. However, The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast and The Latin Times report that White may have been on a Ukrainian hit list, with the latter stating that Alex Jones and his supporters allege this.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on allegations and conspiracy theories. More information is needed to verify the claim.
