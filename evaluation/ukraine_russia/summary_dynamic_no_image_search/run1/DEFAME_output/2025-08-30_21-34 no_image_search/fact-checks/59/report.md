Content: Euronews published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing the resurfacing of false claims about Ukrainian kickbacks to US politicians. The article states that an image circulating on social media lists US politicians, including Joe Biden, and alleges they received bribes from Ukraine. The article debunks these claims, stating there is no evidence to support them and that the claims have been debunked by other fact-checkers. The article mentions that the image has been circulating since at least 2023.

## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. Multiple sources debunk the allegations, and the image has been circulating since at least 2023. `false`
