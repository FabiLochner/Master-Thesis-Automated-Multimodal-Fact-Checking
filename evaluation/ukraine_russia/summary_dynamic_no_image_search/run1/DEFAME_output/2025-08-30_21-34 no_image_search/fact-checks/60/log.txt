Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html): 
Content: The AOL article, published on November 13, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Elon Musk posted a "last dollar" image for Zelenskyy. The article states that the claim is false, and there is no evidence that Musk posted it. The article includes an image of the purported tweet and mentions that the image is fabricated. The article also notes that a wider internet search and a review of Musk’s X account did not yield any results for this claim. <image:2360>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: The article from Politico.eu reports that Elon Musk mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on X (formerly Twitter) using a meme. The article mentions Musk's troubled relationship with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article also mentions that Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-ukraine-stopped-using-the-starlink-system-and-insulted-elon-musk-united24/): 
Content: The search result from StopFake.org refutes a fake story about Elon Musk. The article mentions a previous debunked fake about Elon Musk. The article also states that Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system.

The claim '<image:19> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic X post from Elon Musk on November 6, 2025 saying 'The last dollar for Zelenskiy'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image in the claim is a fabricated image of a dollar bill with Donald Trump's face on it, which has been found on websites selling custom dollar bill art ([https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/1407539034/custom-dollar-dollar-bill-art-100-dollar](https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/1407539034/custom-dollar-dollar-bill-art-100-dollar)). A web search confirmed that the claim was fact-checked and found to be false, with no evidence of the post on Elon Musk's X account ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)).
