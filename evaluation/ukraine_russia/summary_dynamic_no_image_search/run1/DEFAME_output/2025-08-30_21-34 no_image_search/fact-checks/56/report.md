Ben Stiller denied claims that his trip to Ukraine was funded by USAID, stating that he self-funded his humanitarian trip in June 2022. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed that Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel. The claim that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for his trip to Ukraine was amplified by Elon Musk.
