## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine has been the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan in late 2024 and a freeze on military aid by President Trump in early March 2025. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) reported on August 5, 2025, that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022, and that President Trump announced a new arrangement to send weapons last month. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)), published on February 11, 2025, discusses the Trump administration's military aid, including $652 million in weapons sales and the continuation of aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is inaccurate. The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The CSIS article from February 11, 2025, mentions $652 million in weapons sales. The claim of $350 billion is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided significantly less than $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. The provided sources mention figures around $75 billion and $652 million, respectively, which contradict the claim. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to a report by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war), the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022, which is significantly less than the claimed $350 billion. Additionally, a [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) article from February 11, 2025, mentions $652 million in weapons sales.
