## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, France 24 reported on President Biden's response to Hurricane Helene, including his planned visit to North Carolina and the rising death toll. The article does not mention aid for Ukraine. ([https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118))

The BBC published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing misinformation about the government's response to Hurricane Helene, including images of the hurricane's impact and rescue efforts ![image 9157](media/2025-08-30_21-51-1756590699-742406.jpg), ![image 9163](media/2025-08-30_21-51-1756590702-482235.jpg), ![image 9165](media/2025-08-30_21-51-1756590704-437699.jpg). The Associated Press reported that on September 29, President Joe Biden said he would visit areas impacted by Hurricane Helene <image:i>.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the Associated Press reported that President Biden said he would visit areas impacted by Hurricane Helene on September 29, 2024, there is no mention of him announcing a halt to aid for the affected areas or additional aid for Ukraine. The France 24 article focuses on Biden's response to the hurricane, and the BBC article discusses misinformation related to the event, neither of which mentions the claim's specifics.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that President Biden did make remarks on September 29, 2024, regarding Hurricane Helene. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Biden announcing a halt to aid for the hurricane-affected areas or additional aid for Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While President Biden did make remarks on September 29, 2024, regarding Hurricane Helene, as reported by the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-recover-biden-visit-823be75adbed4fa1d7c108a207dbb3e3), there is no mention of him announcing a halt to aid for the affected areas or additional aid for Ukraine.
