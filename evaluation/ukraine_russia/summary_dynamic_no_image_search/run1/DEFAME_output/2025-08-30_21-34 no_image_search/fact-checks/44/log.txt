Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing misinformation about the government's response to Hurricane Helene. The article mentions claims made by Donald Trump and JD Vance regarding FEMA funds and the government's response to the hurricane. The article includes images of the hurricane's impact and rescue efforts <image:9157>, <image:9163>, <image:9165>. The article also mentions that President Biden condemned the promotion of disinformation about the government's hurricane response.

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-recover-biden-visit-823be75adbed4fa1d7c108a207dbb3e3): 
Content: The Associated Press reports that on September 29, President Joe Biden said he would visit areas impacted by Hurricane Helene this week if it doesn't disrupt rescue and recovery operations. <image:i>

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While President Biden did make remarks on September 29, 2024, regarding Hurricane Helene, as reported by the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-recover-biden-visit-823be75adbed4fa1d7c108a207dbb3e3), there is no mention of him announcing a halt to aid for the affected areas or additional aid for Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
