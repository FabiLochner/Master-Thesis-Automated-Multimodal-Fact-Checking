The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: Following a call on February 12, 2025, between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Trump announced the beginning of peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, as reported by sources like Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). However, the evidence indicates that they agreed to start peace talks, not that an agreement to end the war was reached.

So, the overall veracity is: false
