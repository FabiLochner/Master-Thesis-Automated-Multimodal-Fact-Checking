## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call where they discussed ending the war in Ukraine. According to a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)), Trump shared details of the conversation and agreed to begin peace talks. The article also mentions a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels on the same day.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that after the call, Trump announced that he and Putin had agreed to begin peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call)) states that they agreed to start talks toward a ceasefire. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)) reported that Trump ordered officials to begin talks.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war, but rather that they agreed to begin peace talks.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Trump and Putin had a call on February 12, 2025, and that they discussed ending the war in Ukraine. Following the call, Trump announced the beginning of peace talks.

The claim is not entirely accurate. While the call and subsequent discussions about ending the war are confirmed, the claim states that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that they agreed to begin peace talks, not that an agreement to end the war was reached. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Following a call on February 12, 2025, between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Trump announced the beginning of peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, as reported by sources like Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). However, the evidence indicates that they agreed to start peace talks, not that an agreement to end the war was reached.
