## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal but does not mention the claim. Another source, from Newsweek, states that the claim originated from social media and right-leaning commentators, but there is no evidence to support it. The Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX. ![image 2147](media/2025-08-07_20-01-1754596899-160228.jpg)

The Associated Press published a fact check stating that Russian influencers promoted the narrative. The Ukrainian government never invested any funds into FTX. FTX's co-CEO also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates. The AP's assessment is false.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is likely false. The Newsweek article states that the claim originated on social media and from right-leaning commentators, with no supporting evidence. The Associated Press fact-check also found the claim to be false. The image shows Joe Biden and Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-CEO of FTX, which backed the Ukrainian government's crypto donation website. However, the evidence does not suggest any connection between the US aid to Ukraine and the laundering of funds to Democrat candidates.


## Final Judgement
The search results and fact-checks indicate that the claim is not supported by evidence. The claim originated from social media and right-leaning commentators, and the Associated Press found the claim to be false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates is not supported by evidence. A search revealed that the claim originated on social media and from right-leaning commentators, and a fact-check by the Associated Press found the claim to be false.
