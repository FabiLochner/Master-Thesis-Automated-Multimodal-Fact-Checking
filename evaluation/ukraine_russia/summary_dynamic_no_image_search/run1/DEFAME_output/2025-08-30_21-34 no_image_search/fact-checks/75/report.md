### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and stated that those involved would be considered legitimate military targets. Experts suggest that even if American PMCs were present, it wouldn't necessarily mean the U.S. government directed the raid. The article was published on August 20, 2024. ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273)) ![image 3404](media/2025-08-22_22-10-1755900652-609245.jpg), ![image 3401](media/2025-08-22_22-10-1755900648-897066.jpg), ![image 3403](media/2025-08-22_22-10-1755900651-766075.jpg)

The Anadolu Agency published an article on August 20, 2024, stating that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that US mercenaries were fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The article mentions an incursion into the Kursk region that began on the night of August 5-6.

## Elaboration
The image (![image 24](media/75.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in question has been identified in articles from September 2022, which discuss the Ukrainian army's actions in the Kharkiv region, specifically in Balakleya, and the retreat of Russian forces. The web search results indicate that Russia protested the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during an incursion in August 2024.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is from September 2022 and does not depict the events in Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The image is being misrepresented in a new context. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image provided in the claim is from September 2022 and depicts events in the Kharkiv region, not the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as the claim suggests. While there are reports of Russian protests regarding the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region in August 2024 ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273), [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755)), the image itself does not support this claim.
