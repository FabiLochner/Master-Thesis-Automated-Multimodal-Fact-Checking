7,BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.,False,False,"The claim is false. According to the Asia Fact Check Lab ([source](https://www.example.com/)), the claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was shared by Russian and Chinese media. BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine, and foreign companies are prohibited from purchasing arable land under Ukrainian law. Detector Media also debunked a similar claim, stating that BlackRock did not request restrictions on burying soldiers.
",True,"However, a representative for BlackRock said the claim was baseless.
""This is completely false,"" the spokesperson told AFP on August 22. ""BlackRock Inc. does not own any land in Ukraine.""
A spokesperson for the land committee of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UCAB) told AFP on the same day: ""We haven't heard about anything like that.""
Frederic Mousseau, policy director at the US-based Oakland Institute think tank -- which has published reports on agricultral land reform in Ukraine -- confirmed BlackRock does not own land in the country, although it does hold other Ukrainian assets (archived link).
""According to our research over large land leases in Ukraine presented in our report; 'War and Theft, the Takeover of Ukraine's Agricultural Land', BlackRock doesn't own any land in Ukraine"", he told AFP on August 22 (archived link).

While the search results confirm that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and that Zelensky was present in the area, the context of the image is not confirmed. The evidence does not verify that the image depicts Zelensky arriving in Sudzha or meeting with representatives of the people there.
",True,"A reverse image search and subsequent keyword searches on Google found the same photo -- distributed by the Ukrainian presidential office -- published in AFP's archives on May 29, 2022.

He said the Ukrainian government's use of the camera's original RAW file further suggests it ""is not fake or manipulated."" RAW files retain all of the data from the camera's sensor, without any automatic retouching to the image.
Farid said a model trained to distinguish real pictures from those created by artificial intelligence uncovered no signs of AI generation, either. But he added that he could not rule out whether the toys had been propped up or otherwise staged for dramatic effect.

Car Lovers, the firm that owns the Bugatti dealership in Paris, called the document ""fake news"" in a July 2 press release (archived here).
""The Car Lovers group vehemently denies both that this transaction took place and, therefore, that this invoice exists,"" the company said.

",False,"The photo of a suited Zelenskiy shaking Klaus Schwab’s hand is from January 2020, two years before Russia invaded Ukraine.
A photo of a suit-wearing Volodymyr Zelenskiy shaking hands with the World Economic Forum’s founder has been presented online as evidence of double-standards by the Ukrainian president, though online discourse omits context that the photo is from years before Zelenskiy adopted more simple, military-style attire in solidarity with his citizens at war with Russia."

",True,"However, a poll, carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, opens new tab (KIIS) found 63% of Ukrainian respondents approved of Zelenskiy, up from 56% in May 2024.
The White House, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment.
The latest poll, part of a project funded by The British Academy, surveyed 1,600 people between November 2024 and January 2025. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of Zelenskiy's actions as president, 26.1% of respondents said they “completely approve” and 36.9% said they “tend to approve”.
Another KIIS survey, carried out from February 4-9 this year, found 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskiy. The poll showed 37% of respondents do not trust him.
Anton Hrushetskyi, director of KIIS, told Reuters that while similar, trust and approval are not identical concepts. He said a person can approve of someone's activities, but that does not necessarily mean that they trust them.
Olga Onuch, a professor in comparative and Ukrainian politics at the University of Manchester who worked with KIIS to produce the surveys, said in a statement on Wednesday, opens new tab: “Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic - Zelenskiy remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine. Spreading misinformation about his legitimacy directly aids Kremlin propaganda and undermines the Ukrainian people's right to determine their own future.”"

He did also say that he saw no reason to speak to Trump.
However, these comments presented alone lack important context, as Zelenskiy said he saw no reason to speak to Trump, because Trump was not yet the sitting president."

",True,"It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.
Trump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false."

While we could not independently confirm that the claim was true, several reputable news organizations from various countries, including CNN and French newspaper Le Figaro (archived), all reported that Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine and served alongside Ukrainian forces for three years, and provided sufficient photographic evidence."
26,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.,False,False,"The claim is false. While a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House in February 2025, and was reportedly contentious, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy was not made during that meeting. Fact-checks from sources like [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159) confirm that Zelenskyy did not make the statement, and it appears to be taken out of context from a 2023 speech.
",True,"Zelenskyy did say, ""The U.S. will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending [our] sons and daughters to war."" However, he was talking about a hypothetical situation in which Ukraine losing the war against Russia would lead to a broader conflict resulting in Americans being pulled into fighting. He made this statement in February 2023, two years before the exchange with Trump took place."

",True,"The Ukrainian president submitted a 2024 asset declaration to the National Agency on Corruption Prevention covering 2023 that detailed his owned properties, income, bank accounts and vehicles. The NACP is a Ukrainian government unit that takes asset declarations from all politicians who receive a salary from the state. 
According to the declaration, Zelenskyy owned fewer than 15 properties, none of them in the U.S., owned no planes and had an annual income of around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. Records searches in Florida's 67 counties revealed no properties in Zelenskyy's name.
The declaration listed just one overseas bank account holding 350,272 euros (around $377,000). Given the above, we rate this claim false."

",True,"What's True
Zelenskyy did meet with Democratic U.S. senators ...
What's False
... but that meeting also included at least three Republican senators. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, emphatically rejected claims that the Democrats of the U.S. Senate delegation had dissuaded Zelenskyy from taking the minerals deal. Further, Zelenskyy confirmed to reporters two days after the meeting that his country was ready to accept the deal."
30,"In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.",False,False,"The evidence from August 2025, including articles from Reuters and The Guardian, indicates that while peace talks were ongoing, no peace deal between Ukraine and Russia had been reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but do not confirm the existence of a peace deal.
",True,"Claims of a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia actually repeat key parts of a proposed U.S.-Ukraine agreement for sharing revenue from Ukraine's natural assets, including minerals. This agreement is not a peace deal but would bring Americans to Ukraine and give the U.S. a vested interest in peace in the country."
31,"In August 2024, Ukraine passed legislation banning the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.",False,True,"In August 2024, Ukraine enacted a law prohibiting religious organizations linked to the Russian Orthodox Church, as confirmed by sources such as the [Law of Ukraine ""On the Protection of the Constitutional Order in the Field of Activities of Religious Organizations""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Ukraine_%22On_the_Protection_of_the_Constitutional_Order_in_the_Field_of_Activities_of_Religious_Organizations%22).

",False,"What's True

… the law does not pertain to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the church to which the majority of Ukrainian Christians belong. Claims that Ukraine banned the Orthodox Church entirely or that it outlawed Christianity are false."
32,"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said, 'Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong.'",True,False,"The claim is partially accurate. The search results confirm that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia, as stated in the claim ([IMDb.com](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)). However, the claim includes the phrase ""So basically that's wrong,"" which is not part of the original quote.
",False,"Harris made the statement in March 2022, responding to a journalist's request to explain the situation in Ukraine in layman's terms. She continued, ""And it goes against everything that we stand for. There are terms that we use, we say, 'We respect the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of countries,' right? Their independence. Russia has gone into Ukraine militarily, unprovoked, with no justification other than to exercise its power to take over another country."""

",True,"The claim was false, however. If Putin had made such a request, reliable news sources in either Russia or the United States would have reported on it. That had not happened. If Russia wanted to extradite Fauci, it would likely have to file a Red Flag Notice with Interpol. That, too, had not happened.
Even if the claim came from a reliable source of information, there's a major hurdle standing in the way: The United States and Russia do not have an extradition treaty with each other. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. does not generally extradite without a treaty. "
36,Russian state TV aired nude photos of Melania Trump shortly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election.,True,True,"The claim is true.

",True,"The photos of Melania Trump used in the broadcast were not new or leaked images but widely known and previously published photos from her modeling career. Melania Trump addressed the photos in September 2024, saying: ""Why do I stand proudly behind my nude modeling work? The more pressing question is, why has the media chosen to scrutinize my celebration of the human form in a fashion photo shoot? Are we no longer able to appreciate the beauty of the human body?"""
37,In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.,False,True,"The claim is supported by evidence that Joe Biden boarded a plane after three freed Americans arrived in the U.S. in August 2024. Sources such as the [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms) and [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html) confirm this, with the former stating the plane was empty and the latter suggesting Biden boarded to speak to those who helped bring the prisoners home.
",False,"In sum, Biden did not board an ""empty plane."" Video evidence and information from eyewitnesses show Biden walked onto the plane to visit at least one pilot and possibly other people who were still onboard."
38,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.,False,False,"Based on reports from sources like Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Pennsylvania and met with Kamala Harris before the 2024 US presidential election. While Republicans, including JD Vance and Donald Trump, accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Democrats, and Le Monde suggested his actions signaled involvement in the election, there is no direct evidence of explicit campaigning for Kamala Harris. Therefore, the claim is considered false.
",True,"A Facebook post said Zelenskyy ""engaged in election interference by campaigning"" in Pennsylvania for Harris.
In September 2024, Zelenskyy visited a Scranton ammunition plant to thank its workers who were producing munitions for Ukraine. A video of his visit shows Zelenskyy touring the site and thanking workers.
Although Shapiro served as a Harris campaign surrogate, he attended the Scranton event in his official capacity as governor. Harris did not attend the Scranton event. Zelenskyy met with Harris and Trump separately later the same week.
Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton plant was not covert, and experts said it doesn’t meet any definition of foreign election interference.
We rate this statement False."

While White claimed to be on such a list, and Alex Jones spread misinformation, the Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack, and evidence suggests White was not on any such list ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html), [https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)).
",True,"After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was fatally shot March 10 in Austin, Texas, police said they believe the suspects were burglarizing White’s car when White interrupted them.
White is not on a Ukrainian enemies list. In June 2024, Texty.org.ua, an independent Ukrainian media outlet, shared online a list of research subjects as part of its analysis of rhetoric opposing Ukrainian aid. White was among the people whose statements were analyzed.

However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.
",True,"The post is not on Elon Musk’s X account.
A search for news reports about Musk saying he would ban Volodymyr Zelenskyy from X yielded no results.
The spelling of Zelenskyy’s name in the screenshot is not the same spelling Musk uses on X when criticizing Zelenskyy."

While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, such as the one reported by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973), this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.
",True,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country’s military has received only a portion of the more than $175 billion in U.S. aid earmarked for Ukraine’s war against Russia. Now, critics of that U.S. support are floating an unsupported claim: that the funding has been misused through corruption or money laundering.
Much of the money the U.S. has dedicated for Ukraine aid is spent in the U.S. on domestic weapons manufacturers and U.S. military and government operations.
Direct military support to Ukraine totaled about $70 billion out of the $175 billion Congress has appropriated. 
The money isn’t being laundered, it’s being spent as Congress intended."

A Yahoo News article, referencing a PolitiFact fact-check, debunks the assertion that Biden announced no further aid for Hurricane Helene victims while simultaneously allocating funds to Ukraine. Furthermore, The Guardian reported on the White House's efforts to secure disaster relief, contradicting the claim.
",True,"No link between Ukraine and Helene aid, and Joe Biden didn’t rule out future hurricane aid
In Sept. 29 remarks to reporters, President Joe Biden did not say no more aid would be provided for areas affected by Hurricane Helene. He also did not tie hurricane funding to Ukraine war funding; a Ukraine aid package Biden announced days earlier came from money Congress already appropriated.
Biden said all available resources were in place before the storm made landfall. A fact sheet detailed numerous steps the White House had taken, including issuing disaster and emergency declarations for affected states.
In a Sept. 30 White House address, Biden said he expects to ask Congress for a supplemental spending bill for hurricane aid."

",True," Misbar reviewed Trump and Netanyahu’s full meeting, finding that the claim originated from a misinterpretation in Netanyahu’s statement about the situation in Gaza. After a reporter asked Trump whether the resettlement plans for Gaza were still on the agenda or not, Trump passed the question to Netanyahu, who said that Gaza is “closed in.” Netanyahu answered that people in other war zones, specifying Syria and Ukraine, had a choice to leave the country. Gaza, however, is the only place where people are locked in. He claimed Israel was not restricting them. Netanyahu then asked, “What is wrong with giving people a choice?” referring to the resettlement plans for Gazans."

However, the search results do not support the claim that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US.
",True,"Germany’s Foreign Minister Criticized Europe’s Exclusion From U.S.-Russia Talks. The claim emerged after Germany’s Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, criticized the exclusion of European countries from U.S.-Russia talks on the Ukrainian war, which were recently held in Saudi Arabia. Baerbock argued that lasting peace in Europe cannot be achieved without European involvement, warning that temporary peace would allow Russia to regroup for future conflicts. She also stated that downplaying Europe’s role would benefit Russia and called for greater confidence in dealing with the new U.S. administration."

While Scholz was aware of Trump's peace plan, there is no evidence to support the claim that he declared a state of emergency in response to it.
",True,"Contrary to the viral claim, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not call for a state of emergency in Germany after Trump’s recent peace talks. A closer review of Scholz’s speech reveals that he referred to “Notlage,” not “Notstand” as claimed. In the video, Scholz said, “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.” In German, “Notstand” means a state of emergency that would severely restrict citizens’ rights. However, “Notlage” appears in the German Basic Law and signifies an urgent situation, but it does not equate to a government-imposed state of emergency.”"
52,"After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.",False,False,"Following the phone call between Trump and Putin on February 12, 2025, they agreed to begin negotiations and peace talks, as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call). However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war.
",True,"Misbar’s team searched for the claimed statement from Trump but did not find any reports from credible media outlets. However, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he had a call with Putin on February 12, 2025, during which they discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, energy, artificial intelligence, and various other subjects. During the call, both presidents agreed to have their teams start negotiations immediately. Trump said he would call President Zelenskyy to inform him of their decision, which he planned to do while writing the post. Media outlets also reported that Ukraine talks would start, citing Trump’s post, but did not report that Trump had reached an agreement to end the war."
53,"As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.",False,False,"The claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, and PBS News reported that Russian losses topped 1 million by June 2025 ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war)), the exact figure for February 2025 is not explicitly stated.
",True,"For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term ""lost"" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was ""interested primarily from the standpoint of death,"" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: ""Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months."" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were ""recoverable."" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a ""minimum"" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550."
54,Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States,False,False,"The investigation found evidence of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine, including the sale of US-made weapons, as reported by the [Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/). However, the evidence does not specify the percentage of arms being sold, thus the claim cannot be verified.
",True,"Claims that NATO weapons and ammunition are being put on sale on the dark web have re-surfaced in recent months, but as other outlets have reported, there is no evidence that any such products have actually made it into the hands of a prospective buyer. A Newsweek analysis of similar claims made in 2022, the year the war began, reveals a coordinated effort by Russian disinformation networks to spread false narratives about Ukraine's handling of Western-supplied weapons. This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support."

",True,"Misbar investigated the circulating claim and found the claim to be fake; Ben Stiller has publicly denied these allegations, stating that he completely self-funded his trip and received no payment from USAID. Stiller met with Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv as part of his role as an ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in 2022. In response to the circulating video, Stiller took to X to refute the claims, stating, ""These are lies coming from Russian media. I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind. 100% false."" Furthermore, there is no evidence to support that E! News posted that video."

61,Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.,False,False,"While reports from sources like Newsweek, The Economic Times, and India Today indicate that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's motorcade was involved in an incident, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. Furthermore, although there are speculations about Putin's health and potential death, as discussed in the Wikipedia article ""Claims of Vladimir Putin's incapacity and death"" and Legion Magazine, these are not confirmed. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.
",True,"Putin is alive. On April 11, Putin met US envoy Steve Winkoff in Saint Petersburg to discuss “various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement.” The Kremlin leader also recently met Russian nationals who were freed following their captivity in the Gaza strip.

In his French accent, Macron replied that he would never offer advice to Trump. He added that he ceased his discussions with Putin “after Bucha and the war crimes,” explaining that, at the time, Macron believed that France “had nothing to get from him.” In the press conference clip, published by several outlets including CTV News, the word “Bucha” is clearly audible in Macron’s French accent, not “butcher.”"
