### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)" ([Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. ![image 3835](media/2025-08-22_23-51-1755906677-227417.jpg) and ![image 3836](media/2025-08-22_23-51-1755906677-937291.jpg) ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While the DoD OIG audit revealed documentation issues, it does not confirm the aid is a money-laundering operation. The ISW fact sheet indicates oversight of the aid. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)) details allegations of corruption and investigations. The BBC News reported on January 28, 2024, that Ukraine's security service uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973)) ![image 4464](media/2025-08-23_11-50-1755949825-724000.jpg), ![image 4465](media/2025-08-23_11-50-1755949826-081475.jpg).


## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money-laundering operation. The AP interview does not mention the amount of US aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, including an arms purchase uncovered by Ukraine's security service, this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The AP interview with Zelenskyy, as reported by the [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14), does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, such as the one reported by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973), this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.
