### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether Thune had the power to block Schiff's assignments and whether he actually did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Schiff was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy, not Thune.
