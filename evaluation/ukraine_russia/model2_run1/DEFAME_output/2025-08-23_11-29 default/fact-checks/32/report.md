## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
IMDb.com ([Source](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)) contains a quote by Kamala Harris: "Ukraine is a country in Europe. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country." ![image 1](media/0.jpg) PBS News ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-harris-meets-with-ukraines-zelenskyy-as-russia-makes-nuclear-warning)) reports on Kamala Harris's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where she criticized suggestions that Ukraine should cede territory for peace with Moscow. The Brookings article ([Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-trump-and-harris-handle-the-russia-ukraine-war/)) discusses how Harris would handle the Russia-Ukraine war, mentioning her commitment to supporting Ukraine and maintaining sanctions on Russia. ![image 2002](media/2025-08-07_19-31-1754595091-239131.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence from IMDb.com ([Source](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)) confirms that Kamala Harris made a statement that includes the following: "Ukraine is a country in Europe. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country." The claim accurately reflects this statement. However, the claim also includes the phrase "So basically that's wrong," which is not present in the provided quote.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The first part of the claim, which quotes Harris, is accurate. The second part, which adds the phrase "So basically that's wrong," is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim accurately reflects a quote by Kamala Harris about Ukraine and Russia, but it adds a phrase ("So basically that's wrong") that is not present in the original quote.

The claim is partially accurate because it correctly quotes Harris but includes an unsupported addition. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially accurate. The search results confirm that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia, as stated in the claim ([IMDb.com](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)). However, the claim includes the phrase "So basically that's wrong," which is not part of the original quote.
