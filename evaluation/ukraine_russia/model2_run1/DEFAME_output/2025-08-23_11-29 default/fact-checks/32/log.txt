Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-harris-meets-with-ukraines-zelenskyy-as-russia-makes-nuclear-warning): 
Content: PBS News published on September 26, 2024, reports on Kamala Harris's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Harris criticized suggestions that Ukraine should cede territory for peace with Moscow. The article does not contain the quote in the claim.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-trump-and-harris-handle-the-russia-ukraine-war/): 
Content: The Brookings article, published on October 1, 2024, discusses how Trump and Harris would handle the Russia-Ukraine war. It mentions that Harris is committed to supporting Ukraine militarily, economically, and politically, and maintaining sanctions on Russia. The article also references a CBS News article where Harris promised to stand strong with Ukraine and NATO allies. <image:2002>

The claim 'U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said, 'Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. The search results confirm that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia, as stated in the claim ([IMDb.com](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)). However, the claim includes the phrase "So basically that's wrong," which is not part of the original quote.

So, the overall veracity is: false
