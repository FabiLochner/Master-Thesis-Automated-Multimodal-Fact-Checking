## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, The New York Times reported that President Biden approved a revised nuclear strategy to prepare for potential nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea, focusing on deterring these countries simultaneously. The Pentagon anticipates China's nuclear stockpiles will rival those of the U.S. and Russia in the next decade. The Guardian also reported on Biden's approval of a US nuclear strategy for possible confrontations with the same countries, with the White House stating the plan was approved earlier in the year. ![image 4560](media/2025-08-23_11-56-1755950169-054514.jpg)

The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published an article discussing the cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, mentioning that the United States has identified China as its main adversary. The article also mentions that North Korea sent Russia millions of munitions in exchange for food in February 2024. ![image 4561](media/2025-08-23_11-56-1755950182-645916.jpg)
