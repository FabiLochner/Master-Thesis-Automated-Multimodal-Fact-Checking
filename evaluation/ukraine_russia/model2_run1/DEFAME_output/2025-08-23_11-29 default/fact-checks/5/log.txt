Content: The Forbes article, published on October 9, 2024, debunks the claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bought Hitler's parade car for $15 million. The article states that the story originated from a fake news site and was part of a disinformation campaign. The car in question is a Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, which was used by Hitler. The article mentions that the car was previously listed by Worldwide Auctioneers in 2018 and is now in a private collection. <image:199>

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Hitler's parade car which was bought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 15 Million US-$.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.

The image was doctored, and the car was auctioned in 2018. A Forbes article ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/)) also confirms the story's origin in a fake news site.
