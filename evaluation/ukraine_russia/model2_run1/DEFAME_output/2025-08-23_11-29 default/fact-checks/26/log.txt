Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118): 
Content: DW.com published a fact-check article that addresses disinformation related to a dispute between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House. The article mentions a claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to war, but the article states that the quote is taken out of context from a speech Zelenskyy gave on February 24, 2023. The article also mentions a manipulated video that allegedly shows Zelenskyy swearing at Trump. The article states that the video is false.

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159): 
Content: The Associated Press published a fact check article stating that Zelenskyy did not say that Americans will have to send their "sons and daughters" to war in Ukraine. The article includes a video clip and states that the claim is missing context. The article also mentions a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. <image:i>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/world/2025/3/7/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row-0826): 
Content: The ABS-CBN article, published on March 7, 2025, discusses disinformation following a row between Trump and Zelenskyy. <image:4184>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House in February 2025, and was reportedly contentious, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy was not made during that meeting. Fact-checks from sources like [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159) confirm that Zelenskyy did not make the statement, and it appears to be taken out of context from a 2023 speech.

So, the overall veracity is: false
