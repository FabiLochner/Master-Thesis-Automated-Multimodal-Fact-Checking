LONDON (Reuters) - A Russian man serving time in prison for burning a copy of the Koran was found guilty by a court on Monday in a separate treason case and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

A regional court in Volgograd in southwestern Russia said it had convicted Nikita Zhuravel, 20, of state treason for corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation."

Zhuravel's case drew attention last year when Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov published video showing his son Adam, then 15, beating and kicking him while he was in prison in Chechnya awaiting trial for burning a Koran in Volgograd, his hometown.

Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Islamic faith in the overwhelmingly Muslim republic, where Zhuravel was transferred after what Russian investigators said was public pressure from Chechens.

The office of Russia's Prosecutor General said last month that Zhuravel had also been accused of sending footage of a freight train carrying warplanes, and information about the movements of a car linked to a Russian military base to a representative of Ukrainian intelligence.

Zhuravel had pleaded guilty to the crime, the court said in a statement on Telegram on Monday, adding that he had been opposed to what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Russia rarely comments on individual criminal cases.

Zhuravel is serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence following his conviction in February under Russia's law against offending religious believers. Investigators said he had confessed to publicly burning the Koran in a stunt paid for by Ukrainian intelligence.

It was not clear under what circumstances the alleged confession was made.

The number of such cases has risen sharply in Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, as intelligence agencies pursue a crackdown on suspected foreign spies and agents.

Yevgeny Smirnov, a member of a Russian lawyers' association called Pervy Otdel (First Department) which has in the past helped defend people accused of treason, said Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, sometimes tries to entrap people.

He said the FSB contacts people known to be opposed to the war over the internet and encouraged them to commit crimes, such as setting fire to military buildings or sending sensitive information related to the Russian military.

Reuters could not independently verify his assertion. News and World Report.

A Russian man went on trial Thursday for allegedly sending a video of Russian equipment to a Ukrainian official.

The Volgograd District Court began hearing a new case against Nikita Zhuravel, who has been accused of high treason.

Russia's definition of treason has been expanded to include providing vaguely defined "assistance" to foreign countries or organizations, which has effectively made anyone in contact with foreigners vulnerable to prosecution.

What Did Nikita Zhuravel Do?
----------------------------

Zhuravel allegedly filmed a trainload of military equipment and warplanes in 2023 and sent the video to a representative of Ukraine's security agency.

He faces possible life in prison if he is convicted.

In a separate case, a military court sentenced a man named Sergei Andreev, who was convicted of treason and terrorism, on Thursday to 24 years in prison.

Andreev set a military recruitment office in Moscow on fire in November 2023. More AP Photo

Zhuravel Beaten in Russian Custody
----------------------------------

Zhuravel is seen as a political prisoner by rights activists.

He is currently serving a 3-and-a-half-year sentence for burning a Quran outside of a mosque.

Before his current sentence, Zhuravel was beaten while in pretrial custody by the teenage son of Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of the mostly Muslim region of Chechnya.

Ramzan Kadyrov posted a video of the beating on social media and praised his son, which caused a public outcry. Prosecutors said Andreev attacked the office on instructions from the Ukrainian special services that he was sent on a messaging app.

Spike in Treason and Espionage Cases
------------------------------------

Treason and espionage cases have soared in Russia and a wide range of suspects have been targeted including, people critical of the Kremlin, independent journalists and scientists.

Lawyers and experts say prosecutions for these high crimes started to increase after 2014—the year Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and supported a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.

But since Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, treason and espionage cases skyrocketed.

Advocates from Memorial, Russia's oldest and most prominent human rights group, have declared a number of people accused and convicted of treason to be designated as political prisoners. In December 2021, Memorial and its sister organization were ordered to close by Russian courts.

_Sign up to receive CFR President Mike Froman’s analysis on the most important foreign policy story of the week, delivered to your inbox every Friday. commitment has been called into question in 2025, with President Donald Trump freezing all military aid to Ukraine in early March, and then lifting the freeze shortly after, following cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia.

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

In late 2024, the United States also provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan, funded by interest generated from frozen Russian assets.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

The $128 billion figure counts committed aid, much of which has yet to be delivered, according to an [analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraine-now-doomed "analysis")

Why has the United States provided aid to Ukraine?

Much of the U.S. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defense and counteroffensive against Russia.

What weapons and equipment has the United States sent Ukraine?

NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the [risk of a nuclear war](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war "risk of a nuclear war")
. In addition, after widely broadcast friction between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a February 28 Oval Office visit, European nations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all stepped up pledges of support. 

For nearly three years of war, the United States has provided or agreed to provide Ukraine with a long list of defense capabilities."

Critical Questions by Mark F. While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided significant military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the specific amount of $350 billion as of February 2025. One source mentions approximately $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). Another source mentions a $20 billion loan in late 2024 ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)). The evidence also mentions weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific data on the total military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025. The provided evidence does not include the exact amount.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 has been a target of pro-Russian propaganda for years, but a fresh wave of accusations and defamation against him and his country is surging online.

This latest disinformation campaign was fueled by a [recent dispute in the Oval Office](/en/trump-zelenskyy-white-house-fight-ukrainian-reactions/a-71795975)
 between Zelenskyy, [US President Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 and Vice-President [JD Vance](/en/jd-vance/t-70177094)
.

"NewsGuard has seen a significant increase in false claims about Ukraine on US social media in recent weeks, particularly since Donald Trump accused Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for US military support," Madeline Roache, managing editor at misinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told DW.

"We've seen an avalanche of different disinformation campaigns, influence campaigns, different means trying to portray President Zelenskyy personally as a bad leader, the person that should resign, the person that made everything wrong and that Ukraine is bad, corrupt and should stop the war. From February 18 to February 24, 2025, NewsGuard identified about 27,600 social media posts and articles mentioning "Zelenskyy" alongside terms like "villa," "yacht," "winery," or "mansion" — a 2,524% increase from the previous six-day period, which saw just 1,050 such mentions.

[DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of the viral claims.

Did Zelenskyy swear at Trump on camera in London? 
--------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Zelensky burning a very big bridge," [claimed](https://archive.ph/F7L06 "External link — claimed")
an X user in a post that garnered 4 million views. The post features a video allegedly showing Zelenskyy swearing at Trump while arriving to meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the day after their argument in the Oval Office. This claim appeared in several viral posts on [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/fIBtH "External link — X")
, accompanied by a short video clip in which Zelenskyy says, "The US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war. "Okay, thank you so much", Zelenskyy answered.

Did Zelenskyy demand Americans fight in Ukraine?
------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** President Zelenskyy "demanded" that the US send its "sons and daughters" to fight in Ukraine. The video, originally [posted on TikTok](https://archive.ph/w5cIM "External link — posted on TikTok")
, suggests Zelenskyy used the words "F\*\*\* him" or "F\*\*\* Trump" to reporters on his way inside, using a "beep" sound in order to cover the alleged expletive.      

**DW Fact Check:** False.

The TikTok video allegedly showing Zelenskyy swearing at Trump garnered milions of views on XImage: Tiktok/DW

A comparison of the [original footage](https://x.com/AlexSeale/status/1895890187789431191 "External link — original footage")
 (also [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHErhW-BP8k "External link — here")
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toHE7I4kPP4 "External link — here")
) of Zelenskyy's arrival at 10 Downing Street with the shared video shows that the Ukrainian President neither mentioned Trump nor used any expletives against him. And they will have to fight… and they will be dying."

The video was shared by [users such as Alex Jones,](https://archive.ph/PsoJL "External link — users such as Alex Jones,")
 an American far-right radio host with a history of spreading conspiracy theories, reaching millions of viewers.

**DW Fact check:** False. 

The video clip is from [a speech Zelenskyy gave on February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZT4hXPiwgGU?t=5782s "External link — a speech Zelenskyy gave on February 24, 2023")
. A January 2025 [US Department of State fact sheet](https://archive.ph/FGy87 "External link — US Department of State fact sheet")
 on US military aid to Ukraine stated that SOF received a total of $42 million, which was allocated for training and other services to develop SOF and Ukraine's National Guard, conventional forces, non-commissioned officer corps, and combat medical care since 2014.

Did Ukraine stage war scenes to get more money from the US?
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Ukraine 'soldiers' have resorted to faking combat in order to appear 'war torn' so the slush fund from the US keeps churning money their way!"  [claimed](https://archive.ph/Mhho8 "External link — claimed")
an X user, posting a video showing a woman in combat uniform receiving professional makeup and asking in Ukrainian whether she should tighten her helmet.

The post went viral, garnering 8.1 million views. And that Ukraine wants to prolong the war rather than stop it," Roman Osadchuk, an open source and disinformation researcher at the National University of Kyiv, told DW.

Many of these claims [align with pro-Russian propaganda narratives](/en/fact-check-russian-fake-news-targets-ukraines-zelenskyy/a-68346906)
 about the [war in Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
, often depicting Zelenskyy as corrupt and profiting from the conflict. A 2024 [report (pages 24–27)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/14/2003647338/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF "External link — report (pages 24–27)")
 by the Special Inspector General to the US Congress, which monitored government activity related to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024, explained Congress appropriated $182.75 billion for Ukraine-related efforts. USAID's share was approximately $39.9 billion, with the bulk allocated to humanitarian aid, governance programs, and public service support.

There was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center."

If USAID were spending $140 million per month (roughly $1.68 billion annually) on a single program, that amount would dwarf the agency's entire budget for operating expenses, inspection, and health programs combined during the same period.

According to [the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://archive.ph/UkbYb "External link — the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense")
, the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF)."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy Donald Trump White House February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy met at the White House on February 28, 2025. The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025, and the meeting was contentious. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) <image:1>

NPR reported that Zelenskyy's visit to the White House on February 28, 2025, ended abruptly after a spat in the Oval Office. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) <image:517> Al Jazeera reported on a "shouting match" between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, 2025, but the article does not contain the quote in the claim. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy and Trump met at the White House on February 28, 2025, and that the meeting was contentious, with reports of a "spat" and a "shouting match." However, none of the provided sources mention Zelenskyy making the specific statement attributed to him in the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive.

“If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election. X is now relying on it too much, and it is ironic that leadership is now complaining that it isn’t working well.”

Musk’s broadside against Zelenskyy comes as the Ukrainian leader and the Trump administration have been [engaged in a war of words](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 over Washington’s efforts to reach a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” after the Ukrainian leader rejected his claims that Kyiv was to blame for the war and raised concerns about being sidelined in Washington’s negotiations with Moscow.

Trump also claimed that Zelenskyy was “very low” in the polls in his country, echoing his earlier claim that the Ukrainian leader had an approval rating of just 4 percent.

In an opinion poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Wednesday, 57 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy, up five points from December.

The Ukrainian leader’s popularity, however, has waned as the war has gone on, dropping from 90 percent in March 2022 to 64 percent in February last year, according to the institute’s polling.

Since taking control of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has been [heavily criticised](/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 for allowing, and in some cases promoting, misinformation on the platform.

An analysis published by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate found that nearly three-quarters of a sample of false or misleading posts about the 2024 US elections did not display accurate notes correcting the record.

“I think there’s a strong chance that X/Twitter becomes a propaganda arm for Musk/Trump – and, in fact, it’s already happening,” Gordon Pennycook, a professor of psychology at Cornell University who studies misinformation, told Al Jazeera.

“I think Musk wants to reform community notes because he doesn’t like being corrected, as is typical for authoritarian oligarchs.”

Musk, one of Trump’s [most powerful allies](/news/2025/2/12/elon-musk-appears-at-white-house-defending-doges-work)
 as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X’s community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

The Tesla CEO, who later on Thursday appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference waving a chainsaw in homage to Argentina’s cost-cutting president Javier Milei, also did not substantiate a claim that widely reported polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology was “Zelensky-controlled” and “not credible.”

Lucas Graves, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches misinformation and disinformation, described Musk’s comments as “extremely concerning”.

“As is often the case with this kind of rhetoric, the accusations are a guide to what we have to look out for from the accuser – a world where private platforms like X can be systematically gamed to favour the political interests and alliances of their owners,” Graves told Al Jazeera.

“A well-designed community notes system can be a useful check on misinformation. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

“In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election,” Musk said, referring to Zelenskyy’s decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion.

“I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this."

 Thursday that he intends to "fix" Community Notes because it "is increasingly being gamed by governments & legacy media." He provided no evidence to support his claim.

What apparently set Musk off was information members added in Community Notes correcting posts on X that claimed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country's elected president, had low approval ratings among its citizens.

For X owner [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/)
, the solution to monitoring misinformation online has been the community, rather than a group of fact checkers. The polling contradicted [President Donald Trump's](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)
 claim that Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

*   [U.S. There's also Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot that is owned by Musk's startup xAI and is used on X.

[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-grok-ai-not-a-good-person/)
 published a story in January about the many negative responses Grok provides when users ask if Musk is a good person. [Futurism](https://futurism.com/the-byte/grok-blasts-elon-musk-misinformation)
 published a similarly themed piece in December, with the headline "Elon Musk's Grok AI blasts Elon Musk as huge spreader of misinformation."

Musk calls Grok a "maximally truth-seeking" AI that is also "anti-woke." Earlier this week, xAI introduced its latest AI model, [Grok 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/elon-musk-xai-grok-3-model-release-ai-competition-.html)
, claiming it can outperform offerings from OpenAI and China's DeepSeek based on early testing, which included standardized tests on math, science and coding. 

Musk did admit during the demo that the model isn't perfect.

"We should emphasize that this is kind of a beta, meaning that you should expect some imperfections," Musk said. Under its constitution, Ukraine can't hold elections while it's at war and under martial law.

In his post Thursday, Musk wrote, "It should be utterly obvious that a Zelensky-controlled poll about his OWN approval is not credible!!" However, there are other available sources.

A consortium that's been conducting extensive polling in Ukraine since 2014 found "63% of Ukrainians now approve of Zelensky's performance as president, a notable increase from the previous year," Joe Stafford, the news and media relations lead at the University of Manchester, wrote in a [post](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/trump-is-making-false-claims-about-zelenskys-popularity/)
 Wednesday.

High favorability ratings for Zelenskyy undermine the narrative that Trump and Musk want to tell.

"If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election," Musk wrote, again without evidence. "It's not a paid person with the job of fact checking."

Musk is not immune
------------------

Additionally, while Musk has pitched Community Notes as a way to replace fact checkers, a recent [study](https://files.maldita.es/maldita/uploads/2025/02/maldita_informe_community_notes_2024.pdf)
 by the Spanish fact-checking nonprofit Maldita showed that many X users still rely on information from professionals."

Musk vows to “fix” X after polls show high support for Ukraine’s Zelensky
=========================================================================

People in this story
--------------------

*   [John Wihbey](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/john-wihbey/)
    

Al Jazeera February, 2025

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country. Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

Content: "You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. ![Donald Trump](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-20T032938Z_1960498084_RC22YCAIM23O_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1740037743.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

“I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it’s going very well,” [Trump said](/news/2025/2/19/trump-says-he-will-probably-meet-putin-this-month-hits-out-at-ukraine)
, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address. In 1994, Ukraine agreed with the US, the United Kingdom and Russia to exchange its nuclear arsenal, the world’s third-largest, for security guarantees.

But the rush of post-Soviet history grated on Putin, analysts say.

Putin has served as Russia’s top leader since 1999, with a four-year period in which he was nominally number two but was widely considered the country’s ultimate centre of power.

He has long sought to establish the theoretical foundations for escalating the war in Ukraine, a country with about one-third the population of Russia and, before the war, about one-ninth the gross domestic product.

As early as 2008, Putin told then-President George W Bush that “Ukraine is not a country”."

Russia’s UK ambassador falsely claims Zelenskyy started Russia-Ukraine war

#### Andrei Kelin

Russian Ambassador to the UK

"Zelenskyy said he would quickly make peace with Russia, but instead, he started a war."

[Source: YouTube, February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gve08si3Oaw&t=989s "Source: YouTube, February 20, 2025")

False

On Feb. By 2019, when Zelenskyy won the presidency, the war had been ongoing for five years.

**Key events:**

*   **2014:** Russia annexed Crimea, and covert Russian forces seized government buildings in Donbas, escalating tensions.

*   **2015:** Putin signed the Minsk agreements, which were designed to solidify Russian control over eastern Ukraine.

*   **2019:** Zelenskyy was elected president, vowing to end the war but refusing to concede to Russia's demands.

*   **2022:** Putin launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. <image:2119>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference after the "Support Ukraine" summit, marking the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Feb. 24, following months of disinformation campaign and military buildup, dismissing global warnings.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Russia controlled parts of eastern Ukraine as early as May 2014.

**Conclusion:** Russia, not Ukraine, initiated the conflict, which escalated significantly in 2022 with Putin’s full-scale invasion.

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. But a planned visit by [Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg](https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-ukraine-russia-war-kellogg-68b413ecde625f6643aebe5759a752e7)
, was postponed “for legal reasons” Zelenskyy said. [Membership in the NATO alliance](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-nato-membership-summit-4156df4062e69e0da38e7c18bf657285)
, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

 said his administration has had “very serious” discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate.

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

Inspector General Robert P. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose. 

An official website of the United States government

Here's how you know

**Official websites use .mil**

A **.mil** website belongs to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization in the United States.

**Secure .mil websites use HTTPS**

A **lock (lock )** or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to the .mil website. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Content: "<image:3835>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Claim%20-%20Fact%20US%20Ukraine%20Support%202.0_0.png)

**US aid to Ukraine does not lack oversight nor has corruption in Ukraine diverted it.**

Claim: _US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine._

Fact: US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability is extensive and growing.

*   Critics point to a recent corruption case in which a small Ukrainian defense enterprise embezzled $40 million from public ammunition procurement funds, **without noting that the Ukrainian government caught the thieves and recovered the money.****\[1\]**
*   Ukraine has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts within its government and defense industrial base enterprises as part of efforts to increase domestic defense production.\[2\]
*   President Zelensky fired the previous defense minister after domestic corruption scandals unrelated to Western assistance emerged, and his replacement, the current minister, is aggressively rooting out corruption.\[3\] The Ukrainian government is also leveraging the robust and expansive Ukrainian NGO community to assist with its anti-corruption efforts.
*   Ukrainian and DoD personnel have been working aggressively to continue to improve monitoring and tracking of US aid, and US DoD officials have stated that there is no evidence that US-provided military assistance to Ukraine has been misappropriated.\[4\]
*   84% of the funds for Ukraine in the current proposed package would go to US companies, the US military, and other allied militaries, not Ukraine, which would get hardware and training from those funds.\[5\]
*   Western-provided weapons are being used as intended.  Mountains of evidence show advanced Western systems being used against Russian forces in Ukraine.\[6\]

**America’s NATO and Asian allies and other European states have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States.**

Claim: _The United States is giving more support to Ukraine than Europe, and Europe hasn’t stepped up._

Fact: America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

*   The EU and its member states have made available $148.5 billion (138 billion euros) - including its recently announced support package of $54 billion (50 billion euros) - to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\[7\]
*   The United Kingdom has pledged $15.1 billion (£12 billion) in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion (£7.1 billion) is for military assistance.\[8\]
*   Canada has committed $1.8 billion (over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022.\[9\] The Canadian military has also has trained approximately 40,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel since 2015, and Canada expanded and extended this program until March 2026.
*   Norway reached a multi-year agreement with Ukraine in February 2023 for a support program that will provide Ukraine with $7 billion (75 billion Norwegian kroner) between 2023 and 2027.\[10\] Norway pledged to allocate to Ukraine around $1.4 billion (15 billion Norwegian kroner) per year and had already provided around one billion dollars (10.7 billion Norwegian kroner) to Ukraine in 2022 and about $1.9 billion (19.9 billion Norwegian kroner) in 2023.
*   NATO member Turkey is building a new drone production facility and service center in Ukraine. Turkey’s leading drone maker, Baykar, announced in September 2023 that Turkey would open a drone production facility and service center for Bayraktar TB2 drones, which reportedly will become operational by early 2025.\[11\]
*   NATO member North Macedonia has sent 10 batches of military aid to Ukraine including Soviet-era military equipment as of November 2023.\[12\] North Macedonia is also training batches of Ukrainian military personnel and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine.\[13\]
*   South Korea is expanding its production of critical 155mm artillery shells to refill Western stockpiles and support the continued provision of ammunition in Ukraine.\[14\]
*   Japan pledged $4.5 billion to Ukraine in December 2023.\[15\] Japan also pledged an additional $37 million contribution to a NATO fund to provide additional support for Ukrainian defense in January 2024.\[16\]
*   Australia provided approximately $590 million (910 million Australian dollars) in overall military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as of late October 2023.\[17\]
*   New Zealand provided Ukraine with more than $48.7 million (80 million New Zealand dollars) in military and humanitarian assistance as of July 2023.\[18\]

**Ukraine is not a “forever war” for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war.**

Claim: _Ukraine is another 'forever war' for the United States._

Fact: This is not an American war.  It’s another nation’s war against an American enemy.

*   Ukrainians are fighting this war, not Americans.
*   The US is helping Ukraine fend off the Russian attack to reduce the risk that the US will have to fight Russia in the future. 
*   A Putin victory over Ukraine would embolden him and encourage him to test America’s willingness to defend its NATO allies, increasing the risk of a US-Russia war.\[19\]
*   Russian victory would also let Russian forces move closer to current NATO borders, forcing the US to commit more troops to the defense of its NATO allies.\[20\]
*   Ukraine is building up its own military and defense industry to be able to reduce its dependence on the US and will be able to do so if the US continues its support.\[21\]
*   Ukraine already has a significant defense industry and was one of the world’s leading weapons suppliers before the Russian invasions and is investing its own money and attracting foreign investors to dramatically increase this capability.\[22\]

**Sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness and reduces the risk that the United States will have to fight Russia itself.**

Claim: _Sending military aid to Ukraine degrades America's military readiness_.

Fact: Sending military aid to Ukraine has enabled the United States to modernize its own military to be better prepared to fight the next war.

*   The US is supporting Ukraine in part so that the US won’t have to fight Russia itself.
*   The overwhelming majority of military assistance is going to build up the US defense industrial base.\[23\]  It is allowing the expansion of current production lines of essential military supplies that the US military will need in any future war.
*   The equipment the US has been giving Ukraine is mostly old and sometimes inoperable.\[24\]  The US is purchasing new systems to replace what it gives Ukraine, modernizing the American military in the process.
*   American allies are also reinvigorating their defense industries and modernizing their militaries as consequences of support to Ukraine, which benefits the US.\[25\]

**The United States is not sending Ukraine a “blank check.”**

Claim: _The United States is/was sending Ukraine a "blank check."_

Fact: The United States has not given Ukraine a blank check. <image:3836>

Content: The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine. The audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies. The audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. The DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)". The release date is not mentioned.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. <image:3835> and <image:3836> ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")

The scandal came to light when a [whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower")
 report revealed that President Trump had asked Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 in July 2019 to investigate [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
, Trump's political opponent in the [2020 presidential election](/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election")

 Trump acknowledged he had told Zelenskyy "we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son \[contributing\] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[\[25\]](#cite_note-trump_acknowledges-25)
 According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President [Mike Pence](/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence")
, and Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Balsamo-190926-26)

In 2014, the [Obama administration](/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama "Presidency of Barack Obama")
 was trying to provide diplomatic support to the post-[2014 Ukrainian revolution](/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution "2014 Ukrainian revolution")
 [Yatsenyuk government](/wiki/First_Yatsenyuk_government "First Yatsenyuk government")
 in Ukraine, and then-vice president Joe Biden was "at the forefront" of those efforts.[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)
 Biden's son [Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden")
 joined the board of directors of [Burisma Holdings](/wiki/Burisma_Holdings "Burisma Holdings")

 Hunter, then an attorney with [Boies Schiller Flexner](/wiki/Boies_Schiller_Flexner_LLP "Boies Schiller Flexner LLP")

 In a December 2015 interview, Joe Biden said he had never discussed Hunter's work at Burisma.[\[73\]](#cite_note-bloomberg-73)
 Joe Biden traveled to Ukrainian capital [Kyiv](/wiki/Kyiv "Kyiv")
 on April 21, 2014, and urged the Ukrainian government "to reduce its [dependence on Russia for supplies of natural gas](/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector "Russia in the European energy sector")

Since 2012, the [Ukrainian prosecutor general](/wiki/Prosecutor_General_of_Ukraine "Prosecutor General of Ukraine")
 had been investigating Burisma's owner, oligarch [Mykola Zlochevsky](/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky "Mykola Zlochevsky")
, over allegations of [money laundering](/wiki/Money_laundering "Money laundering")
, [tax evasion](/wiki/Tax_evasion "Tax evasion")
, and corruption.[\[68\]](#cite_note-sorting-68)
 In 2015, [Viktor Shokin](/wiki/Viktor_Shokin "Viktor Shokin")
 became the prosecutor general, inheriting the investigation. A transcript of the Trump–Zelenskyy call confirmed Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son [Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden")

[\[11\]](#cite_note-helderman-11)

Former acting chief of staff [Mick Mulvaney](/wiki/Mick_Mulvaney "Mick Mulvaney")
 said one reason why Trump withheld aid to Ukraine was Ukrainian "corruption related to the DNC server", referring to a debunked theory that Ukrainians framed Russia for [hacking into the DNC](/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak "2016 Democratic National Committee email leak")
 system.[\[12\]](#cite_note-becket-12)
 Trump has publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.[\[13\]](#cite_note-tremendous-13)
 The Trump administration's top diplomat to Ukraine, [Bill Taylor](/wiki/William_B._Taylor_Jr. The abuse of power charge stemmed from allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden by withholding $391 million in military aid approved by Congress, while the obstruction charge accused him of systematically blocking congressional subpoenas and witness testimony during the inquiry. Trump first claimed it was withheld because of corruption in Ukraine, but later said it was because other nations, including those in Europe, were not contributing enough aid to Ukraine.[\[49\]](#cite_note-:0-49)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025. The interview, also covered by U.S. News & World Report, focused on Zelenskyy's concerns about excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks and his views on NATO membership. The AP article does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)" ([Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. <image:3835> and <image:3836> ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.


## Actions

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While the DoD OIG audit revealed documentation issues, it does not confirm the aid is a money-laundering operation. The ISW fact sheet indicates oversight of the aid. More information is needed to verify the claim.

The SBU said defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided

**Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m).**

The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.

It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.

Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.

Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

The SBU said an investigation had "exposed" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, "who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells".

"According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement," it said.

The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, "not a single artillery shell" was ever sent.

One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said.

Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.

Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.

The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.

In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.

Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a [2022 corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022)
 by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.

But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim cannot be verified. The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money-laundering operation. The AP interview does not mention the amount of US aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, including an arms purchase uncovered by Ukraine's security service, this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)" ([Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. <image:3835> and <image:3836> ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While the DoD OIG audit revealed documentation issues, it does not confirm the aid is a money-laundering operation. The ISW fact sheet indicates oversight of the aid.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. The Houthi arsenal of surface-to-air missiles [includes](https://www.csis.org/analysis/missile-war-yemen)
 Russian-made missiles originating from prewar Yemeni army stocks, such as the SA-6/Faster (Innovator) surface-to-air missile and the Thaqib (Piercer) missile family. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. The shootdowns of US drones boost morale for Houthi supporters at a time of great hardship under Western and Israeli air strikes. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks, a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the [Iran-backed militants.](https://apnews.com/hub/houthis)

According to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week — suggesting the militants’ targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.

“Military leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within U.S operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do,” their letter said.

In addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.

Hegseth decided in March to beef up the Navy warship presence in the Middle East, ordering the USS Harry S. had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.

The Houthis have been waging [persistent missile and drone attacks](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-israel-hamas-red-sea-shipping-ab6fee82e73170b7e2edbab90ed6c14c)
 against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as an effort to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and [killing four sailors.](https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba)
 That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.

### Operation Prosperity Guardian: American-led military coalition

While the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them.[\[204\]](#cite_note-212)
[\[205\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-213)
 In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden")
 region.[\[205\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-213)
 The operation, codenamed [Operation Prosperity Guardian](/wiki/Operation_Prosperity_Guardian "Operation Prosperity Guardian")
,[\[206\]](#cite_note-214)
 was formally launched on 23 December 2023.[\[176\]](#cite_note-Gronholt-pedersen-184)
 It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf")
 and [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz")
 during the "[Tanker War](/wiki/Tanker_War "Tanker War")
" of the 1980s,[\[205\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-213)
 and the ongoing maritime security operations of [Combined Task Force 153](/wiki/Combined_Task_Force_153 "Combined Task Force 153")
, the US Navy-led task force based in [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain")
.[\[164\]](#cite_note-Wintour2023-172)
 The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat [Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa](/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia")
, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats.[\[207\]](#cite_note-215)

#### Independent naval patrols for maritime security

France, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the [French frigate _Languedoc_](/wiki/French_frigate_Languedoc "French frigate Languedoc")
 intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate [_Virginio Fasan_](/wiki/Italian_frigate_Virginio_Fasan_(F_591) "Italian frigate Virginio Fasan (F 591)")
 under the Secure Mediterranean operation.[\[16\]](#cite_note-itdec-20)
 India has also sent two [_Kolkata_\-class destroyers](/wiki/Kolkata-class_destroyer "Kolkata-class destroyer")
 to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea.[\[20\]](#cite_note-HT19dec-24)

### Pro-Palestinian protests

Main article: [Houthi attacks on commercial vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")

Houthi forces began attacking shipping vessels affiliated with [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 passing through the Red Sea on 19 November 2023. The video game's developers, [Bohemia Interactive](/wiki/Bohemia_Interactive "Bohemia Interactive")
, said that action taken against the videos was ineffective, saying: "With every video flagged, debunked, or taken down, ten more can be uploaded each day."[\[122\]](#cite_note-cbsnews20240605-130)
 Footage from the video game has also been misrepresented as attacks on shipping[\[128\]](#cite_note-136)
 and a US fighter jet being shot down by the Houthis over Sanaa.[\[129\]](#cite_note-137)

Since 2014, the Houthis, who oppose [Yemen's internationally recognized government](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
, have controlled a considerable swath of the country's territory along the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea")
. The sources also stated that Iran has escalated its provision of advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, since the outbreak of the Gaza war.[\[3\]](#cite_note-hez-4)

US officials told _[Semafor](/wiki/Semafor_(website) "Semafor (website)")
_ that commanders and advisors from Iran's [Revolutionary Guards](/wiki/Revolutionary_Guards "Revolutionary Guards")
 are currently stationed in Yemen, and are directly involved in the Houthi attacks on commercial traffic in the Red Sea. The [Qods Force](/wiki/Qods_Force "Qods Force")
, has overseen the transfer of the attack drones, cruise missiles, and medium-range ballistic missiles which have been used in the strikes on Red Sea and Israeli targets in recent weeks.[\[1\]](#cite_note-semafor-2)

According to Western intelligence officials, the Iranian [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps")
 placed an intelligence gathering ship to guide Houthi attacks on ships that switch off radios and identifiers.[\[130\]](#cite_note-138)

In October 2024, _[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is associated with the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and not with a US drone being shot down by the Houthis. The geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Israel. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the provided image does not depict such an event.

([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/))

The Associated Press reports that Houthi rebels have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The article was published on November 20, 2024. The image <image:20>

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is associated with the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and not with a US drone being shot down by the Houthis. The geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Israel. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the provided image does not depict such an event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:20>) appears in articles about the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center ([FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel)) and TURDEF ([Israel Defence News - TURDEF](https://turdef.com/country/israel-news?page=5)) both feature the image. The Times of Israel also published the image in an article about the Hamas attack ([The Daily Edition | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-daily-edition/2023-10-07/)). None of the articles mention a US drone being shot down by the Houthis using Russian missiles.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council published an article discussing Houthi strikes on US MQ-9 Reaper drones, mentioning that the Houthis shot down three MQ-9 Reapers between 2017 and 2019. On December 28, 2024, the Houthis announced they shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen, and four days later, they claimed to have downed a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate. The Houthis' arsenal includes Russian-made missiles.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

[Immigrants from Central Asia find hostility and violence in Russia](https://apnews.com/article/russia-immigrants-crackdown-xenophobia-central-asia-3fb300676f1855bc13e20bd7780534ea)

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

Intelligence about the depot's munitions, its vulnerabilities, and nearby Russian defensive systems was provided to Ukraine by the [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
. The depot reportedly stored not only artillery shells, but also [Iskander](/wiki/Iskander "Iskander")
 missiles, [Tochka-U](/wiki/Tochka-U "Tochka-U")
 ballistic missiles and [glide bombs](/wiki/Glide_bomb "Glide bomb")
 and it is unclear if his [bomb damage assessment](/wiki/Bomb_damage_assessment "Bomb damage assessment")
 includes both missiles and artillery ammunition.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.
