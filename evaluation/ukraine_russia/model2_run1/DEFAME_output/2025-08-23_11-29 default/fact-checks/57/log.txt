Content: The search result from the University of California, Berkeley, published on January 29, 2025, discusses a circulating video featuring an AI-generated audio recording of Donald Trump criticizing Keir Starmer.

Useful result: From [Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/podcast-bro-theo-von-questions-224125941.html): 
Content: The search result mentions that Theo Von had Donald Trump on his podcast last year. It also mentions that Von's interview with Trump made the president "the most human that I’ve actually seen him." The article also mentions that Von is beginning to question the “America First” claims that Trump made during his campaign. <image:4358>, <image:4359>.

The claim 'In an interview with podcaster Theo Von in August 2024, Donald Trump criticized British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von in August 2024, the original interview did not include any discussion of the UK or Ukraine. A video with AI-generated audio was created to make it appear as though Trump criticized Keir Starmer, as reported by the University of California, Berkeley ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)).
