 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

He told us this is “an obvious—and not particularly well-executed—fake”...

” podcasters for amplifying his message. Von’s ability to be a _good hang_—whether interviewing President Donald Trump or socialist streamer Hasan Piker on his popular podcast, _This Past Weekend_—has made him an unlikely conduit for regular Americans to learn about and engage with politics.

Von is a 45-year-old from Louisiana with Polish and Nicaraguan heritage; he talks openly about his past substance addictions and working-class struggles. <image:4357>

Few people embody the shifting norms of the media landscape more than the comedian and podcaster Theo Von. Von has since continued his connection with Trump, delivering a stand-up set at a Trump event in Qatar in which he acted out someone with Down syndrome and called the Navy “gay.” But while Von embraces political incorrectness, he is often more self-deprecating and empathetic than his peers. “You almost feel ashamed of yourself.”

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von in August 2024, the original interview did not include any discussion of the UK or Ukraine. A video with AI-generated audio was created to make it appear as though Trump criticized Keir Starmer, as reported by the University of California, Berkeley ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)).

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

MORE FOR YOU

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States, and the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described it as "Russian propaganda."

Content: "Greene's trades have often drawn red flags due to her committee roles and the timing of the trades.

Musk's comments on Congressional wealth comes after former President **Joe Biden** supported a ban on Congress trading last year.

"Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they're in the Congress," Biden said in an interview.

Biden said he was able to live on a Congressional salary and not worry about becoming rich through playing the stock market previously.

Representative **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) [previously told Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/05/39096827/exclusive-khanna-says-shameful-congress-members-profited-from-stocks-calls-for-trading-ban-makin?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 that he will continue to advocate for a vote to ban the practice.

“We should have a vote on it,” Khanna told Benzinga.

Khanna said that despite his continued speeches in the House advocating for a ban on stock trading, there is a “collective shrug” in Congress regarding the issue.

"It is shameful that over three years after the pandemic with the shenanigans from those senators who sold their stock after learning of the pandemic" there still hasn't been a vote, Khanna said.

Khanna said that people were outraged at the time when several senators sold their stocks in tourism and other sectors that would be hurt, knowing that the economy could crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Senators making money when the rest of the country was suffering during the pandemic."

 in 2023 through a collaboration with Subversive. Does anyone know?" Musk tweeted.

The quoted tweet included the following members of Congress:

*   **Nancy Pelosi** (D-Calif.): Annual salary $223,000, Net worth $202 million
    
*   **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.): Annual salary $200,000, Net worth $95 million
    
*   **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.): Annual salary $210,000, Net worth $75 million
    
*   **Elizabeth Warren** (D-Mass.): Annual salary: $285,000, Net worth $67 million
    

The replies included a post from the original poster with additional examples of politicians who have net worths of more than $50 million.

"I am not suggesting anything. While the former speaker of the house has been accused of providing insider information to her husband in the past, her husband makes investments as part of his career.

People in the comments were quick to point out inaccuracies in the net worth amounts with Warren estimated to be worth significantly less than this amount.

Story Continues

**Why It's Important:** Musk's post took aim at members of Congress regardless of their political party.

In comments made alongside **Donald Trump,** Musk said he questions how members of Congress are getting significantly wealthier while in office, while joking that maybe they're just good at investing.

"I think the reality is they're getting wealthier to taxpayer expense," Musk said.

An investigation into members of Congress and their investing activity and payments made by special interest groups while in office could reveal that members of both the Republican and Democratic parties made questionable moves to help boost their wealth.

This could be an interesting move by Musk, who is currently aligned with the Republican party and has the support of many Republican members of Congress.

The Unusual Whales congressional trading report for 2024 showed that Democrats averaged a 31.1% return in 2024 and Republicans averaged a 26.1% return versus the S&P 500 at 24.9%.

The top 10 traders in 2024 list was made up of six Republicans and four Democrats with five Congress members having returns of more than 100% in 2024.

Of the individuals listed in Musk's quoted tweet above, Pelosi ranked 10th in 2024 at +70.9%. Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk Questions Congress Members' Wealth: 'Where Did They Get All The Money?'
=================================================================================

[Chris Katje](/author/)

Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 8:00 PM 5 min read

Billionaire **Elon Musk** targeted members of Congress who enjoy rising wealth amounts while in office, which comes as retail traders place larger emphasis on politicians’ [stock and options trading activity.](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/congress-trading?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)

**What Happened:** Members of Congress can buy and sell stocks, options and cryptocurrency as long as they disclose the transactions in a timely manner.

This activity has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years as trades made by members of Congress often appear to be conflicts of interest based on non-public knowledge and can sometimes be stocks related to government-funded contracts.

     **Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.**
    

A post that discussed several prominent members of Congress with their annual salaries and net worths caught the attention of Musk, who is currently the world's richest person worth $379 billion.

"It's not like these politicians started companies or were NBA All-Stars, so where did they get all the money? Make your own conclusions," the poster tweeted.

The annual salaries in the post could include other sources of income and may not be strictly their Congressional salary.

The post also doesn't take into account how much the net worth of members of Congress was before they took office or what their spouses do.

Pelosi's husband **Paul Pelosi** is a venture capitalist who regularly buys and sells technology stocks. McConnell ranked 21st at +42.4%.

Financial disclosures show that Pelosi has millions of dollars in real estate investments, business partnerships and stock holdings.

A Napa, California, home and vineyard the California Democrat owns is worth between $5 million and $25 million and generated between $100,001 and $1 million in income from grape sales, according to her 2019 report.

The couple also own several commercial properties that generate rental income in that same range and hold investments in undeveloped real estate.

While assets listed on the form total between $57 million and $271 million, liabilities range from $20 million to $97 million. Liabilities include multimillion-dollar mortgages on several properties and equity credit lines.

Pelosi’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The claim: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has amassed more than $196 million in wealth working on a congressional salary of $193,400
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the richest members of Congress, but a social media post circulating about the wealth she has built while earning a congressional salary is wrong about her net worth.

The post claims Pelosi has been in office for 28 years, during which she earned $193,400 per year. <image:1238>

Fact check: No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't worth $196 million

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. That’s about $90 million less than the figure cited in the meme.

Where is all that money coming from?

Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987, when [members were paid $89,500.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1011.pdf)
 Today, as [speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500.](https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries)
 As minority leader, Pelosi would have earned the $193,400 spelled out in the meme.

But her salary from a 34-year career in Congress, including 18 years as minority leader and speaker, doesn’t tell the whole story about the personal wealth she and her husband have built.

[Two polls](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/post-debate-polls-bad-news-biden-00166395)
 out on July 3, 2024 – both taken after last Thursday’s presidential debate – show that more voters are now supporting former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden. Biden, 81, [is the first octogenarian to occupy](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html)
 the Oval Office – and his main rival, former President Donald Trump, is 78.

I [first wrote about most](https://theconversation.com/why-are-us-politicians-so-old-and-why-do-they-want-to-stay-in-office-217024)
 voters’ concerns about the presidential candidates’ ages in the fall of 2023 – and since then, those concerns have only grown. It’s a bipartisan trend: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, is 72, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is 81. Bernie Sanders is 81 and hasn’t mentioned retirement at all.

In the House, California Democrat and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at age 84, is running for reelection for her 19th [full term in office](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosi-seek-re-election-reversing-earlier-plan-2022-01-25/)
. Mitch McConnell appeared to freeze while speaking with the media, raising questions about his age and health. The news comes amid a [barrage of media reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/democrats-biden-debate-fallout-00166208)
 that leading Democrats are questioning Biden’s abilities and stamina because of his age. In February, special counsel Robert Hur [declined to charge Biden with mishandling classified](https://apnews.com/article/biden-memory-age-special-counsel-report-doj-f4232bc8316e556ed467185b67c3e0a8)

A [Gallup Poll released in June 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx)
 found that about 67% of Americans say Biden is too old to be president."

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine

Hunter Biden (left) with his father, current US President Joe Biden

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

 on Thursday. <image:4360>!Getty Images Bill Barr <image:4365>Getty Images

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

A viral [image](https://www.facebook.com/groups/219072197013585/posts/919402760313855/)
 claims that 18 prominent U.S. politicians have received “kickback” payments from Ukraine.

The earliest version of the post identified by **The Dispatch Fact Check** first [appeared](https://pantip.com/topic/42264850)
 on a Thai-language website on October 3, 2023. The original post [links](https://vkvideo.ru/video314215067_456255754?id=455042096)
 to a Russian video site featuring an episode of _Redacted_, an online news channel run by former _Fox & Friends_ co-host Clayton Morris that [regularly spreads](https://voxukraine.org/en/the-network-of-russian-propaganda-what-connects-western-experts-promoting-narratives-beneficial-to-russia)
 anti-Ukraine conspiracy theories. “There’s no credible sources whatsoever, anywhere, in any contexts that show that Ukraine is making these sorts of payments.”

Content: The BBC News article from July 21, 2023, reports that a top Senate Republican released an FBI document detailing an allegation that President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm. <image:4361>, <image:4363>, <image:4365>. The document is an unclassified memo from June 2020, outlining claims by a foreign informant. The article states that there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. The memo alleges that Burisma made two $5m payments to "the Bidens". The FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. 6 tweet.

> [](https://twitter.com/CforCD/status/1854169532924891301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“The tweet attributed to Elon Musk about the alleged ‘last dollar for Zelenskyy’ featuring a bill with Donald Trump’s portrait is fake. This is fabricated content intended for manipulation and provocation,” reads the tweet.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/no-elon-musk-didnt-post-the-last-dollar-for-zelenskyy)
 this claim, saying that Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels spread the fake image, though noted the Ukrainian channels said it was satire.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

**_UNITED24_** **did not report such information, and neither did any other credible source.**

Ukraine has found an alternative to the American satellite system Starlink, a number of pro-Russian sources [report](https://archive.ph/JTBdd)
 citing _UNITED24_. At the same time while commenting on this decision communications officer Ruslana Danilkina allegedly spoke obscenely about Elon Musk in the context of his recent comments about Ukraine.

! On her [personal page](https://www.instagram.com/rusya_danilkina/)
, she also did not publish any offensive comments about Elon Musk, and did not comment on this news invented by propagandists.

For now, Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system, despite the tensions in relations with the United States. They had previously used the _UNITED24_ brand identity to spread the fake that [eight villas of Ukrainian generals burned down in Los Angeles.](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-eight-villas-belonging-to-ukrainian-generals-burned-down-in-los-angeles/)

And secondly, Ruslana Danilkina, who was called a communications officer in the video, does not actually currently hold combat positions in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Electronic warfare equipment manufacturer and former Air Force officer Anatoly Khrapchinsky [considers](https://www.unian.ua/war/starlink-hrapchinskiy-poyasniv-chi-maye-ukrajina-alternativu-suputnikovomu-zv-yazku-12932037.html)
 the Starlink shutdown unlikely: _«Both Trump and Musk are about money. That’s why they won’t give up multibillion-dollar, multimillion-dollar contracts."

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The Redbubble website contains an image of a one-dollar bill with Donald Trump's face on it, which is available as a sticker. <image:2384>, <image:2385>, <image:2386>, <image:2387>, <image:2388>, <image:2389>, <image:2390>, <image:2391>, <image:2392>, <image:2393>, <image:2394>, <image:2395>, <image:2396>, <image:2397>, <image:2398>, <image:2399>, <image:2400>, <image:2401>, <image:2405>, <image:19>.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The AOL article ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)) fact-checks the claim and states that it is false. The reverse image search shows that the image is available on Etsy and Redbubble as custom art.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image is a meme and has been debunked by fact-checkers.
`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Elon Musk posted an image of a dollar bill with Donald Trump's face on it, mocking Zelenskyy, is false. Fact-checkers, such as the one from AOL ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)), have debunked the image, and reverse image searches show the image is available as custom art.

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)
 the [already-strict security measures](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-bulletproof-vest-armor-public-events-security-1908361)
 surrounding the Russian leader to an unprecedented degree, unnamed Russian and Kremlin officials told _The Moscow Times_ in June 2024.

$3,55,796 limo from Putin's fleet explodes into fireball on Moscow street: Report

New Delhi,UPDATED: Mar 30, 2025 15:23 IST

An Aurus limousine, believed to be part of Vladimir Putin’s official car fleet, exploded and caught fire on a Moscow street near the FSB secret service headquarters. There were no reported injuries or fatalities, Daily Express reported.

Some people on social media, however, speculated that it was likely an assanation bid against Putin.

Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has claimed multiple assassination attempts on Putin have been made.

The explosion follows a series of high-profile Russian military deaths, fueling Kremlin paranoia. [#Putin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Putin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The 72-year-old Russian President often uses Russian-made Aurus vehicles and has gifted them to foreign leaders, including North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.

The incident is likely to heighten Kremlin concerns over assassination plots.

Earlier this year, the Kremlin warned that any attempt on Putin’s life would trigger a nuclear response. In December, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, accused of overseeing chemical warfare in Ukraine, was killed in a Moscow explosion.

Vladimir Putin in August 2025

Speculations regarding the health of [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")
 have been a regular occurrence since his rise to power. This is largely speculation and cannot be accredited for authenticity.

Background
----------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\
\]

Further information: [Public image of Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Public_image_of_Vladimir_Putin "Public image of Vladimir Putin")

For approximately 20 years, multiple sources have regularly reported that the [president of Russia](/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia")
 [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")
 is weeks or months away from death or medical incapacity.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 At various points, it has been rumored that he is suffering from terminal [thyroid cancer](/wiki/Thyroid_cancer "Thyroid cancer")
, [blood cancer](/wiki/Blood_cancer "Blood cancer")
, [abdominal cancer](/wiki/Abdominal_cancer "Abdominal cancer")
, [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease")
, [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy")
, serious surgery complications, the aftereffects of a [stroke](/wiki/Stroke "Stroke")
, or that he is, in fact, already dead.[\[2\]](#cite_note-nyt-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)
[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

According to the _[New Statesman](/wiki/New_Statesman "New Statesman")
_, many such allegations are based on "the old Soviet-era practice of [Kremlinology](/wiki/Kremlinology "Kremlinology")
, in which analysts scrutinise the leader's public appearances for signs of physical decline and clues as to who might be in favour or out, in the absence of reliable information".[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

In 2005, _[The Atlantic](/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")
_ published an essay, based on observation of film footage, alleging Putin had suffered a stroke and was dying.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 2014 report of cancer")\

It was reported according to an unnamed German doctor, that Putin was receiving treatment for an "often terminal form of cancer".[\[5\]](#cite_note-ind-5)
 Russian government spokesman Dmitri Peskov denied the claim.[\[5\]](#cite_note-ind-5)

### 2015 report of cosmetic surgery complications

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 2015 report of cosmetic surgery complications")\
\]

Mainstream media outlets in the United States reported that Vladimir Putin might be seriously ill due to complications from a secret cosmetic surgery procedure it was claimed he'd undergone.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 The rumors originated after the Russian president postponed a scheduled meeting from 11 to 18 March, as well as analysis of background objects in official photographs by Russia observers.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)

_[Vox](/wiki/Vox_(website) "Vox (website)")
_ reported that "the idea that Putin would schedule plastic surgery for a week when he was supposed to have multiple public meetings seems highly implausible" and Russian government spokesman Dmitri Peskov denied Putin was suffering any type of medical issues.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 Asked to comment on the report Putin was dying of surgery complications, the Brookings Institution's Hannah Thoburn said "for all we know, he probably has the flu, or just wanted to hang out with his daughters or something".[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)

Following the 2022 [Russian invasion of Ukraine](/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine")
, according to _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")
_, rumors of Putin being seriously ill became "a subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics, and potential wartime propaganda, even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying".[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

In May 2022, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov reported that Vladimir Putin was simultaneously suffering from "several serious illnesses, one of which is cancer".[\[8\]](#cite_note-graun-8)
 [Christopher Steele](/wiki/Christopher_Steele "Christopher Steele")
 also alleged Putin was "dying".[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

 denied the allegation; William Burns, the director of the United States [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")

 The _[Sunday Mirror](/wiki/Sunday_Mirror "Sunday Mirror")
_ published its own story the next day also reporting that Putin may have been dead.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

In July 2022, the _[Toronto Sun](/wiki/Toronto_Sun "Toronto Sun")
_ and other media outlets reported Putin had lost use of his right arm due to an unexplained medical crisis. The _Toronto Sun_ cited, as evidence of the allegation, that a video showed Putin swatting a [mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito")
 with his left arm instead of his right.[\[10\]](#cite_note-ts-10)

Neurologists have previously noted that several Russian officials such as [Anatoly Sidorov](/wiki/Anatoly_Sidorov "Anatoly Sidorov")
 and [Sergei Ivanov](/wiki/Sergei_Ivanov "Sergei Ivanov")
 who, like Putin, have specialized training by Soviet-era military and intelligence services and typically make limited use of their right arm, often holding it unnaturally stiff to the side of the torso in what is called [gunslinger's gait](/wiki/Gunslinger%27s_gait "Gunslinger's gait")

In December 2022, Solovei announced Putin was being treated with cancer drugs for an unspecified, advanced stage cancer and "the end is already in sight".[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)

Speculation about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s health is only surpassed by theories surrounding the nature of his relationship with U.S. 
\[TASS\]

**Ukrainian President** Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in Paris on March 27, 2025, and boldly predicted the demise of his avowed enemy, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“He will die soon, and that’s a fact, and it will come to end,” declared the man whose leadership through one of history’s more improbable military campaigns has been compared to Winston Churchill’s during the Battle of Britain.

Zelenskyy, who has been targeted by Russian assassins since Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, apparently didn’t expand on the statement. How he expects Putin to die, by poor health or some other means, wasn’t clear. Putin has survived at least a half-dozen assassination attempts and a raft of rumoured health issues spanning more than two decades.

But Zelenskyy’s assertion spawned yet another wave of speculation about the 72-year-old Putin’s welfare after he has spent the last three-plus years directing an unexpectedly taxing war of aggression in Ukraine.

[! The rumours, old and new, have never been proven.

In late 2016, Russian historian and political analyst Valery Solovei said Putin might be forced to step back from his role for health-related reasons. It found this was likely a learned behavioral adaptation to allow quick access to a firearm in response to a sudden threat and probably not a signifier of any medical condition in either Putin or other high-profile Russians.

> Neurologists have noted that several Russian officials typically make limited use of their right arm, often holding it in what is called gunslinger’s gait.

**In 2022**, the General Svr Telegram channel reported that Putin had soiled himself after falling down stairs, and blamed it on “cancer affecting his stomach and bowels.” Other reports point to his “increasingly erratic behaviour,” and there has been speculation about his mental health.

_The New Statesman_ says many such allegations are based on “rumours swirling within the intelligence community and the old Soviet-era practice of Kremlinology, in which analysts scrutinise the leader’s public appearances for signs of physical decline and clues as to who might be in favour or out, in the absence of reliable information.”

“To be clear,” the news magazine’s Katie Stallard added in a piece first published June 2, 2022, “there is no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill. Still less so that he is dead.”  
> _—Katie Stallard,_ The New Statesman

**_The New York Times_** has said Putin’s health became a particular “subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics, and potential wartime propaganda” since the invasion of Ukraine, “even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying.”

William Burns said during his 2021-25 tenure as CIA director that “as far as we can tell, he’s entirely too healthy.” Richard Moore, head of Britain’s MI6, said there is “no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious illness.”

Regardless, evidence that Putin has resorted to body doubles, ostensibly as a defence against potential assassination attempts, is relatively strong. <image:4447>](https://legionmagazine.com/long-standing-rumours-of-putins-impending-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/pu1/)

This story is from March 31, 2025

Is Putin battling a string of deadly diseases? Rumors suggest Putin is battling severe illnesses, including cancer, Parkinson's, and potential use of body doubles to mask his condition.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy surprised everyone with his bold remark about his arch enemy and Russian President Vladimir Putin during his Paris speech, saying he ‘will die soon’. While this may sound surprising to those not following Putin's past public appearances or rumours about his deteriorating health, speculation is rife that the Russian President has been battling multiple health issues from cancer to Parkinson's disease. Here are some of the health issues Putin is rumoured to be suffering from:

Cancer
------

Some intelligent reports have claimed the Russian leader has been fighting not one, but multiple types of cancer - pancreatic, thyroid, and even prostate cancer.

Recent photos show Putin with red eyes and a bruise on his hand. Ukraine has confirmed the use of stand-ins, with one source alleging a double’s "lumpy appearance" at a recent ceremony was too noticeable for makeup to cover.

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

The **Soviet invasion of Manchuria**, formally known as the **Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation**[\[15\]](#cite_note-22)
 or simply the **Manchurian Operation** (Маньчжурская операция) and sometimes **Operation August Storm**,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 began on 9 August 1945 with the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 invasion of the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan")
's [puppet state](/wiki/Puppet_state "Puppet state")
 of [Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo")
, which was situated in Japanese-occupied [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria")
. Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks.[\[39\]](#cite_note-47)
 The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.[\[40\]](#cite_note-48)

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die.[\[41\]](#cite_note-49)
 From the Russians' perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia's defeat in the [Russo-Japanese War](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War "Russo-Japanese War")
 of 1905.[\[42\]](#cite_note-50)
 The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing "Beijing")
 by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.[\[43\]](#cite_note-51)

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on. reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Manchuria (about 700,000) also looted and terrorized the local people of Mukden and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage." In Harbin, Soviet forces ignored protests from [Chinese Communist Party](/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China "Communist Party of China")
 leaders on the mass rape and looting.[\[62\]](#cite_note-FCJones-70)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-CSM-71)
[\[64\]](#cite_note-72)
[\[65\]](#cite_note-73)
[\[66\]](#cite_note-74)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-75)
 There were several incidents in which Chinese police forces in Manchuria arrested or even killed Soviet troops for committing various crimes, leading to some conflicts between the Soviet and Chinese authorities in Manchuria.[\[68\]](#cite_note-76)

During the [Soviet occupation of North Korea](/wiki/Soviet_Civil_Administration "Soviet Civil Administration")
, it was reported that Soviet soldiers committed rape against both [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_people "Japanese people")
 and [Korean](/wiki/Koreans "Koreans")
 women alike in the northern half of the Korean peninsula.[\[69\]](#cite_note-77)
[\[70\]](#cite_note-78)
 Soviet soldiers also looted the property of both Japanese and Koreans living in northern Korea.[\[71\]](#cite_note-:0-79)
 The Soviets laid claim to Japanese enterprises in Manchuria and northern Korea and took valuable materials and industrial equipment.[\[62\]](#cite_note-FCJones-70)
[\[71\]](#cite_note-:0-79)

Konstantin Asmolov of the Center for Korean Research of the [Russian Academy of Sciences](/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences "Russian Academy of Sciences")
 dismisses Western accounts of Soviet violence against civilians in the Far East as exaggeration and rumor and contends that accusations of mass crimes by the Red Army inappropriately extrapolate isolated incidents regarding the nearly 2,000,000 Soviet troops in the Far East into mass crimes. **[^](#cite_ref-CSM_71-0)
    ** _Christian Science Monitor_, 12 October 1945, Japanese armies were guilty of appalling excesses, both in China and elsewhere, and had the Russians dealt harshly with only Japanese nationals in Manchuria this would have appeared as just retribution. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Drea-24)
 They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully [concealing the buildup](/wiki/Russian_military_deception "Russian military deception")
 of a force of 90 divisions. This attack involved the [1st Red Banner Army](/wiki/Soviet_First_Army "Soviet First Army")
, the [5th Army](/wiki/5th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "5th Army (Soviet Union)")
 and the [10th Mechanized Corps](/wiki/10th_Mechanized_Corps "10th Mechanized Corps")
 striking towards [Mudanjiang](/wiki/Mudanjiang "Mudanjiang")
 (or Mutanchiang).[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Once that city was captured, this force was to advance towards the cities of [Jilin](/wiki/Jilin "Jilin")
 (or Kirin), Changchun and Harbin.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Its final objective was to link up with the forces of the Transbaikal Front at Changchun and Jilin thus closing the double envelopment movement.

As a secondary objective, the 1st Far Eastern Front was to prevent Japanese forces from escaping to [Korea](/wiki/Korea "Korea")
, and then invade the [Korean Peninsula](/wiki/Korean_Peninsula "Korean Peninsula")
 up to the [38th parallel](/wiki/38th_parallel_north#Korea "38th parallel north")
,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 establishing in the process what later became [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea")
. This secondary objective was to be carried out by the [25th Army](/wiki/25th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "25th Army (Soviet Union)")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Meanwhile, the [35th Army](/wiki/35th_Army_(Russia) "35th Army (Russia)")
 was tasked with capturing the cities of [Boli](/wiki/Boli_County "Boli County")
 (or Poli), [Linkou](/w/index.php?title=Linkou,_Heilongjiang&action=edit&redlink=1 "Linkou, Heilongjiang (page does not exist)")

#### 2nd Far Eastern Front

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 2nd Far Eastern Front")\
\]

The 2nd Far Eastern Front, under General [Maksim Purkayev](/wiki/Maksim_Purkayev "Maksim Purkayev")
, included:[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)

*   [2nd Red Banner Army](/wiki/Soviet_Second_Army "Soviet Second Army")
    
*   [15th Army](/wiki/15th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "15th Army (Soviet Union)")
    
*   [16th Army](/wiki/16th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "16th Army (Soviet Union)")
     (whose 56th Rifle Corps was its only formation to see combat, on [South Sakhalin](/wiki/South_Sakhalin "South Sakhalin")
    )
*   [5th Separate Rifle Corps](/wiki/5th_Separate_Rifle_Corps "5th Separate Rifle Corps")
    
*   [Chuguevsk Operational Group](/w/index.php?title=Chuguevsk_Operational_Group&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chuguevsk Operational Group (page does not exist)")
    
*   [Amur Military Flotilla](/wiki/Amur_Military_Flotilla "Amur Military Flotilla")
    
*   [10th Air Army](/wiki/10th_Air_Army "10th Air Army")
    

The 2nd Far Eastern Front was deployed in a supporting attack role.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Its objectives were the cities of Harbin and Qiqihar,[\[2\]](#cite_note-Battlefield_Series-2)
 and to prevent an orderly withdrawal to the south by the Japanese forces.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 The front also included the [88th Separate Rifle Brigade](/wiki/88th_Separate_Rifle_Brigade "88th Separate Rifle Brigade")
, composed of Chinese and Korean guerrillas of the [Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army](/wiki/Northeast_Anti-Japanese_United_Army "Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army")
 who had retreated into the USSR in the beginning of the 1940s. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan's surrender.[\[38\]](#cite_note-46)
 Japanese forces were overwhelmed by Soviet attacks."

. The only Japanese civilians who even knew what happened at Hiroshima were either dead or suffering terribly.

Japan had not been too worried about the Soviet Union, so busy with the Germans on the Eastern front. The Japanese army went so far as to believe that they would not have to engage a Soviet attack until spring 1946. But the Soviets surprised them one day after the declaration of war with their invasion of Manchuria, an assault so strong (of the 850 Japanese soldiers engaged at Pingyanchen, 650 were killed or wounded within the first two days of fighting) that Emperor Hirohito began to plead with his War Council to reconsider surrender.

By the early 17th century, Russia had established its authority over all of [Siberia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Siberia)
, but its attempts to move southward were consistently blocked by [China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China)
. Japan, with its modernized army and navy, at once won a series of striking victories against the Chinese, who, in the [Treaty of Shimonoseki](https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Shimonoseki)
 (April 17, 1895), ceded to Japan the [Kwantung (Liaodong) Peninsula](https://www.britannica.com/place/Liaodong-Peninsula)
, on which Port Arthur (now [Dalian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dalian)
) stands, together with Formosa ([Taiwan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Taiwan)
) and the [Pescadores (P’eng-hu) Islands](https://www.britannica.com/place/Peng-hu-Islands)
, and agreed to pay a heavy indemnity.

This display of Japanese power and its decisive victory over China threatened to close the door on Russia in East Asia, and it made conflict between Russia and Japan inevitable. In 1896 Russia concluded an alliance with China against Japan, guaranteeing the [integrity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity)
 of Chinese territory. Russia thus entered into the occupation of the Kwantung Peninsula, from which only three years earlier it had excluded Japan.

Russia, China Simulate Attack on Enemy Submarine in Sea of Japan Drills
=======================================================================

Russia and China wrapped up their joint exercise – dubbed Maritime Interaction 2025 by Russia and Joint Sea 2025 by China – Aug. Image via PLAN media

The Russian Navy and People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) simulated attacks on an adversarial submarine and an amphibious ship, and rehearsed a submarine rescue during a recent five-day joint exercise in the Sea of Japan.

A Russian Navy IL-38 and PLAN Y-8 maritime patrol aircraft located and destroyed a simulated enemy submarine in a joint anti-submarine warfare drill in the Sea of Japan, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Wednesday. The two countries also conducted joint firing exercises, using naval guns to fire at a naval target meant to imitate an enemy assault landing ship detachment.

Russia and China wrapped up their joint exercise – dubbed [Maritime Interaction 2025 by Russia and Joint Sea 2025 by China](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/01/chinese-submarine-makes-first-visit-to-russia-for-joint-drills)
 – on Tuesday following several days of drills. The crew of _Volkhov_ simulated evacuating personnel from the submarine.

Following the completion of the drill between _Volkhov_ and _Xihu_, _Igor Belousov_ carried out a similar exercise with the PLAN submarine, according to the release.

“Russian rescue sailors shared their experience with their Chinese colleagues, demonstrating the capabilities of modern medical equipment, pressure chambers and an AS-40 deep-sea rescue submersible vehicle,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said.

CNS _Shaoxing_ and _Qiandaohu_ carried out a separate set of activities in the Sea of Japan. In both cases, fleet oiler JS _Towada_ (AOE-422) and a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force P-3C Orion MPA shadowed the PLAN ships, according to the JSO release.

Three Russian ships – including a Udaloy-class destroyer, a Ropucha-class tank landing ship, and a Steregushchiy-class frigate – were sighted Saturday sailing east approximately 43 miles northwest of Rebun Island, which lies 31 miles west of Japan’s main island of Hokkaido.

The ships transited east through La Pérouse Strait, which separates Hokkaido from Russia’s Sakhalin Island, to enter the Sea of Okhotsk. La Pérouse Strait is an international waterway and a regular transit route for Russian Navy ships moving between the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk.

JMSDF fast attack craft JS _Wakataka_ (PG-825) conducted surveillance on the Russian ships, according to the JSO release.

The three Russian ships are likely part of the Russian Pacific fleet detachment, which includes destroyer RFS _Admiral Panteleyev_ (548), corvette RFS _Sovershennyy_, amphibious landing ship RFS _Oslyabya_ (066), submarine RFS _Magadan_ (B-602) and rescue tug _Alatau_.

The Russian Pacific fleet is conducting a patriotic and information deployment campaign called “Strength in Truth-2025.” As part of the campaign, the four ships and a submarine are expected to sail to various ports in the Russian Far East to commemorate Russia’s role in World War II, and the activities of Russian Pacific Fleet personnel in the Ukraine conflict.

_Admiral Panteleyev, Sovershennyy, Oslyabya_ and _Magadan_ left Vladivostok on Monday for the deployment. <image:2528>](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/05/army-deploys-hypersonic-missiles-to-indo-pacific-for-australian-drills)

China and Russia have begun joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan as they seek to reinforce their partnership and counterbalance what they see as a United States-led global order.

The Chinese and Russian governments have [deepened](/video/newsfeed/2025/5/8/president-xi-china-and-russia-should-safeguard-international-justice)
 their ties in recent years, with China providing an economic lifeline to Russia in the face of Western sanctions over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Joint Sea-2025 exercises began in waters near the Russian port of Vladivostok and will last for three days, China’s Ministry of National Defence said in a statement on Sunday.

The two sides will hold “submarine rescue, joint anti-submarine, air defence and anti-missile operations, and maritime combat”.

Four Chinese vessels, including guided-missile destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, are participating in the exercises, alongside Russian ships, the ministry said.

After the drills, the two countries will conduct naval patrols in “relevant waters of the Pacific”.

China and Russia have carried out annual drills for several years, with the “Joint Sea” exercises beginning in 2012.

Last year’s drills were held along China’s southern coast.

With this year’s drills in the Sea of Japan, in its annual report last month, Japan’s Ministry of Defence warned that China’s growing military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

“The exercise is defensive in nature and is not directed against other countries,” the Russian Navy Pacific Fleet said earlier this week, according to a report by the US Naval Institute’s online news and analysis portal.

On Friday, the Chinese Defence Ministry said this year’s exercises were aimed at “further deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership” of the two countries.

China has never denounced Russia’s more than three-year [war](/video/newsfeed/2025/8/3/ukraine-claims-drone-strike-on-oil-refinery-in-russia)
 nor called for it to withdraw its troops, and many of Ukraine’s allies, including the US, believe that Beijing has provided support to Moscow.

European leaders asked China last month to use its influence to pressure Russia to end the war, now in its fourth year, but there was no sign that Beijing would do so.

China, however, insists it is a neutral party, regularly calling for an end to the fighting while also accusing Western countries of prolonging the conflict by arming Ukraine.

Claim: "China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Soviet Union invaded Manchuria in August 1945, defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army, which led to the collapse of Japanese puppet states and the return of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to China. The invasion also involved Mongolia and resulted in the capture of Japanese forces and looting by Soviet troops. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)) History.com published an article discussing the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan on August 8, 1945, and the subsequent invasion of Manchuria the following day <image:i>. ([https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria))

The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) between Japan and Russia, fought over dominance in Korea and Manchuria, resulted in Japan's victory, becoming the first Asian power to defeat a European power. <image:2464> ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War))


## Elaboration
The evidence provides historical context regarding conflicts between Russia, China, and Japan. Specifically, it mentions the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945, which led to the return of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to China ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria), [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria)). It also highlights the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), where Japan defeated Russia ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War)).

The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan currently plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources only describe historical events.

To verify the claim, information about current geopolitical relations and any existing plans or intentions of China and Japan regarding Russia would be needed.

Expansion of NATO—or, as its advocates now prefer to term it, NATO enlargement—is the most important international issue on the agenda today. The “regional cooperation” section of the April 1996 U.S.-Japan Joint Declaration on Security did nothing more than list in general terms common regional security goals regarding Korea, China, Russia, and Southeast Asia. Any restrictions on the freedoms of speech, press, or organization after July 1 could touch off a crisis in Sino-American relations, especially if the strictures involved the visible suppression of political protest.

In addition, China’s trade surplus with the United States, at least as measured by official American statistics, will probably exceed Japan’s trade surplus with the United States this year. In line with our [values and policies](/about-us/research-independence-and-integrity-policies/)

!People take part in a protest against the Israeli government, demanding the release of all hostages, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, outside the Israeli consulate in New York City, U.S. Moreover, we could facilitate that reluctant acceptance by rhetorical reassurances and various steps to assuage hurt Russian feelings by elaborating cooperative relations between NATO and Russia.

Opposition to expansion of NATO is, regrettably, the one thing on which virtually all Russian political figures can agree. But proceeding on the present track may be even more destabilizing.

The present course now includes an attempt to negotiate a NATO-Russian “charter” or other agreement, offering a yet undefined security relationship short of Russian membership in NATO. Above all, we should keep in mind that the objective is broader and deeper security, not expanding an organization for some at the cost of diminishing security for all.

**JAPAN**

**by Mike Mochizuki**

The post-World War II security relationship between Japan and the United States was based on a bargain inspired by the Soviet threat: the United States agreed to defend Japan in exchange for access to military bases in Japan. Since the Cold War’s end, Washington and Tokyo have been inching toward updating that paternalistic relationship not only to make it more reciprocal but also to expand its focus to include regional peace and stability.

Domestic pressures in both Japan and the United States argue for redefining the alliance. Washington and Tokyo must broaden the discussion to the coordination of diplomacy and economic policy to nurture a more benign regional environment.

**A New Consensus at Home**

Transforming the U.S.-Japan security relationship into a true alliance will require first of all forging a new domestic consensus in both Japan and the United States.

Recent trends in Japan present an opportunity to mobilize political support for a more activist security policy."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence indicates that China and Russia have been conducting joint military drills in the Sea of Japan since 2012 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/china-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-sea-of-japan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/china-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-sea-of-japan)).

The evidence suggests a complex geopolitical situation where China and Russia are cooperating militarily, while Japan views this with concern. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.

The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress, mentioning that Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee and that Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced the committee assignments. [<image:2574>] and [<image:1>] The document from torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with Adam Schiff (D-CA) assigned to several committees and John Thune (R-SD) assigned to others; it does not mention any blocking of committee assignments. The document from hklaw.com lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether Thune had the power to block Schiff's assignments and whether he actually did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

From [Source](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/12/23/senate-committee-assignments-119th-congress/): 
Content: "Mike Lee will now have influence over important energy-related policies as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Lee will also be joined on one of his committee assignments by freshman Sen.-elect John Curtis.

Late last week, incoming Senate Majority leader John Thune, R-S.D., released the list of GOP Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress.

According to the [press release](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=35D445C9-906D-4766-B50E-75E53D511A31)
 from Thune’s office, “The assignments have been ratified by the Senate Republican Conference and are expected to be ratified by the full Senate early next Congress.”

As the Senate changes from a Democratic to a Republican majority, major changes are being made in leadership and committee assignments.

“Seniority broadly dictates which Republicans are in line for these top posts, although they are technically voted on by the committee membership and then that is ratified by the full Republican conference and on the Senate floor,” according to [CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/gop-senate-committees-new-congress/index.html)

[Government shutdown avoided, Sens. Lee and Curtis be on?

Lee, who is in his third term in the Senate, will serve as the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, according to a post from the senator on [X.](https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1870523447098675336)

This position will “give him power over key issues important to his home state of Utah and a front-row seat to set energy policies that Republicans plan to champion in the next Congress,” according to [CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/gop-senate-committees-new-congress/index.html)

He will also sit on the Senate Judiciary, Foreign Relations and Budget committees.

“It is an honor to serve the people of Utah,” Lee wrote on [X](https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1870523447098675336)
 in regards to his committee assignments.

Curtis will join Lee on the Foreign Relations Committee, according to the [press release](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=35D445C9-906D-4766-B50E-75E53D511A31)
 from Thune’s office.

Curtis will also sit on the Senate Environment and Public Works, Commerce, and Small Business committees.

“Tackling inflation, unlocking American energy, combatting global instability, and supporting small businesses are priorities Utahns have asked me to address,” Curtis said, according to a press release from his office. Mike Crapo will serve as the chairman of the Finance Committee, per the [press release.](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=35D445C9-906D-4766-B50E-75E53D511A31)

Crapo will also sit on the Senate Banking; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Judiciary; and Aging and Budget committees.

Idaho’s other senator, Jim Risch, will be the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, which Lee and Curtis are both on.

According to Thune’s press release, Risch has also been assigned to sit on the Senate Energy, Intel, Small Business, and Ethics committees.

### Other notable committee assignments

Two other outspoken and well-known Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have been named as the chairs of powerful committees.

“Cruz, Lee and Paul have often railed against Senate GOP leadership — and committee chairs — over government funding, deficit spending and other hot-button issues,“ according to CNN. [Utah](https://www.deseret.com/utah/)

 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating "immoral" and "corrupt" conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether Thune had the power to block Schiff's assignments and whether he actually did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

 ![Image:](//static.prsa.pl/images/0cef8818-5db9-4622-ab61-65537c098870.jpg)Image: Polish Ministry of Defence/gov.pl

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade was a showcase of military equipment, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration that started on August 14.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia. The evidence confirms a parade took place on August 15, 2024, and the celebrations started on August 14. The evidence does not mention the parade being a preparation for war with Russia.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event but lacks evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

 A Russian academic with close ties to senior Russian diplomats said that Putin probably lost interest in further talks in Qatar because the "Russian leadership usually does not make any compromises under pressure" and attacks on energy infrastructure are highly effective tactics that do more damage to Ukraine than to Russia, adding that Russia is more interested in talks with Ukraine about a broader ceasefire.[\[306\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-308)

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:4578>!Getty Images A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk <image:4579>Getty Images

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.

Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."
