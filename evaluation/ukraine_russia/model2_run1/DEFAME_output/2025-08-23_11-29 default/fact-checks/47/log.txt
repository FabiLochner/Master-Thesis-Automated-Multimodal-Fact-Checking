Content: The search result from without-lie.info states that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fake. The article mentions the release date of the fake cover as March 20, 2025, with the serial number 1705. The real cover was published on March 19, 2025. <image:14> The article also includes images of the fake cover and the real cover. The author is Олександр Гороховський, and the article was published on March 23, 2025.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake, as confirmed by multiple sources like Myth Detector ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)), without-lie.info ([Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)), and aol.com ([Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)). The cover's date and serial number are also incorrect.

So, the overall veracity is: false
