## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that Joe Biden was present when the freed Americans arrived in the U.S. in August 2024. The evidence also indicates that Biden boarded the plane. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when Biden boarded it. The Times of India article states that Biden entered an empty plane, but the Yahoo News article suggests that Biden boarded the plane to speak to the people who helped bring the freed prisoners home.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the exact reason for Biden boarding the plane is not entirely clear.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden was present when the freed Americans arrived and that he boarded the plane. While one source states the plane was empty, another suggests he boarded to speak to those who helped bring the prisoners home.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
The claim is supported by evidence that Joe Biden boarded a plane after three freed Americans arrived in the U.S. in August 2024. Sources such as the [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms) and [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html) confirm this, with the former stating the plane was empty and the latter suggesting Biden boarded to speak to those who helped bring the prisoners home.
