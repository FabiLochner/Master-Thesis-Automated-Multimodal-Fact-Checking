## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trumps-moment-how-the-us-president-can-help-netanyahu-make-the-wise-choice-on-gaza/)) published an article discussing the situation in Gaza, mentioning a dinner at the White House on July 7, 2025, with Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump, and a minister vowing that "not a single grain of wheat" would enter Gaza. ![image 4234](media/2025-08-23_11-42-1755949376-341258.jpg), ![image 4240](media/2025-08-23_11-42-1755949379-171577.jpg) The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-gaza.html)) reports that during a White House visit, Benjamin Netanyahu did not dismiss the idea of relocating Palestinians from Gaza, and Trump discussed which countries might accept Gazans. <image:k>

CBS News ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) reports on a meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in April 2025. ![image 4250](media/2025-08-23_11-43-1755949395-202364.jpg), ![image 4248](media/2025-08-23_11-43-1755949392-609739.jpg) The article discusses the Israel-Hamas war, ceasefire talks, and the possibility of a deal, but does not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine or Syria.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in April 2025, as stated in the claim. The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-gaza.html)) reports that Netanyahu did not dismiss the idea of relocating Palestinians from Gaza during this visit, and Trump discussed potential host countries.

However, the evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The CBS News article ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) about the meeting does not mention any specific resettlement plans.

Therefore, while the visit and the discussion about relocation are confirmed, the specific claim about resettlement plans to Ukraine and Syria is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in April 2025 and that the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza was discussed. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.

The claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his April 2025 White House visit is not supported by the evidence. While the visit and discussions about relocating Palestinians were confirmed by sources like The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-gaza.html)) and CBS News ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)), there is no mention of specific resettlement plans to Ukraine or Syria.
