The claim '<image:3> This image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces who were killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While the image shows coffins draped in the Union Jack, and there have been reports of British casualties, the specific details of the claim, including the number of soldiers, location, and date (November 2024), are not supported by the available evidence. Claims of British Special Forces casualties in Odesa have been debunked by Ukrainian military officials and lack evidence ([https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
