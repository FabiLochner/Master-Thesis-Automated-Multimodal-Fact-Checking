Useful result: From [Source](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202203/22/WS62392e6fa310fd2b29e52706.html): 
Content: China Daily published an article on March 22, 2022, stating that the Chinese government would provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The Red Cross Society of China provided assistance to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society earlier in March. The article includes a photo of humanitarian aid supplies sent by the Red Cross Society of China to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. <image:62392e6fa310fd2bec7cf19c.jpeg>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Red Cross Society of China has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Chinese Red Cross troops deploying to the Russian-Ukrainian front. The reverse image search did not yield any relevant information.

So, the overall veracity is: false
