Content: CNN reports that US Vice President J.D.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on February 14, 2025, J.D. Vance stated the US could use military "tools of leverage" against Russia. The evidence does not explicitly state that the US military action is available against Russia, but it does imply it.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that J.D. Vance made statements about potential US actions against Russia in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on February 14, 2025. While the claim states "military action is available," the evidence specifies "tools of leverage," which includes military options.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on February 14, 2025, US Vice President J.D. Vance stated the US could use military "tools of leverage" against Russia, as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/jd-vance-us-troops-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk). This aligns with the claim that military action is available, as "tools of leverage" includes military options.
