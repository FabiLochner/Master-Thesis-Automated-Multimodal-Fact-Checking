## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukrainian authorities have uncovered corruption schemes within the defense sector, involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices and kickbacks. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported on a scheme involving military drones and signal jamming systems, while Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) highlighted a scheme where participants received 30 percent of the contract amount. These revelations followed criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's actions regarding anti-corruption agencies.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

The Harvard International Review ([https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/)) states that Ukraine has historically had a large black market for arms and mentions reports of weapons being stolen in Ukraine since 2022.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43% ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The U.S. saw a 29% increase in arms sales to a record $318.7 billion in 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand)). The Washington Post reports that U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/): 
Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) published an article on September 23, 2024, discussing the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine. The article mentions the sale of US-made M240 machine guns for $8,000 and Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launchers for $6,000. It also notes seizures of heavier weapons, including an anti-aircraft gun and a US machine gun. The article highlights that tackling arms trafficking is a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement. ![image 1149](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505233-537411.jpg), ![image 1150](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505233-914391.jpg), ![image 1151](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505234-319361.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that arms trafficking is occurring in Ukraine, including the sale of US-made weapons. However, the evidence does not specify the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The investigation reveals evidence of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine, including the sale of US-made weapons. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The investigation found evidence of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine, including the sale of US-made weapons, as reported by the [Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/). However, the evidence does not specify the percentage of arms being sold, thus the claim cannot be verified.
