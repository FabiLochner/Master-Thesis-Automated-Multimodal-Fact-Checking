Claim: "![image 20](media/62.jpg) This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 20](media/62.jpg))
reverse_search(![image 20](media/62.jpg))
web_search("US drone shot down Houthi Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 20](media/62.jpg)) appears in articles about the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center ([FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel)) and TURDEF ([Israel Defence News - TURDEF](https://turdef.com/country/israel-news?page=5)) both feature the image. The Times of Israel also published the image in an article about the Hamas attack ([The Daily Edition | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-daily-edition/2023-10-07/)). None of the articles mention a US drone being shot down by the Houthis using Russian missiles.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council published an article discussing Houthi strikes on US MQ-9 Reaper drones, mentioning that the Houthis shot down three MQ-9 Reapers between 2017 and 2019. On December 28, 2024, the Houthis announced they shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen, and four days later, they claimed to have downed a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate. The Houthis' arsenal includes Russian-made missiles.

The Associated Press reports that Houthi rebels have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The article was published on November 20, 2024. The image ![image 20](media/62.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is associated with the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and not with a US drone being shot down by the Houthis. The geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Israel. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the provided image does not depict such an event.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is associated with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, not with a US drone being shot down by the Houthis. The geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Israel. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the image does not depict such an event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is associated with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, as evidenced by its appearance in articles from the [Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel), TURDEF, and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-daily-edition/2023-10-07/). The geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Israel. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the image does not depict such an event.
