## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A Yahoo News fact-check from Snopes rates the claim as "False". Zelenskyy's asset declaration shows fewer than 15 properties, no planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000. There is no trace of a $35 million Florida mansion in Zelenskyy's name (![image 524](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502455-991461.jpg), ![image 525](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502456-175388.jpg)). The Times of India states that Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million and includes two wholly owned apartments, two co-owned apartments, a commercial property, and five parking spaces. The OCCRP revealed that Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelenskyâ€™s family to continue receiving money from the offshore (<image:k>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
Myth Detector states that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's income decreased after the war began, and his family's financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. According to Forbes, Zelenskyy's net worth is less than $30 million. The article also includes links to other articles debunking claims about Zelenskyy's real estate holdings.

AOL reports that Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million, not $1.5 billion, and his monthly income is $930.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources contradict the claim's assertions about Zelenskyy's assets and income. Snopes fact-check rates the claim as "False," citing Zelenskyy's asset declaration, which shows fewer than 15 properties, no planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000. There is no trace of a $35 million Florida mansion in Zelenskyy's name.

The Times of India states that Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million. AOL reports that Zelenskyy's monthly income is $930, and Celebrity Net Worth estimates his net worth at roughly $1.5 million. Forbes estimates Zelenskyy's net worth is less than $30 million.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including Snopes, The Times of India, and AOL, provide evidence that contradicts the claim's assertions about Zelenskyy's property, assets, and income. The evidence shows significant discrepancies in the number of properties, the existence of private planes, the amount of money in overseas accounts, and the monthly income.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a $35 million Florida home, $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, three private planes, and has a monthly income of $11 million is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Snopes](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html) and [AOL](https://www.aol.com/much-volodymyr-zelenskyy-worth-160047933.html) show that Zelenskyy's actual assets and income are significantly lower than what is stated in the claim.
