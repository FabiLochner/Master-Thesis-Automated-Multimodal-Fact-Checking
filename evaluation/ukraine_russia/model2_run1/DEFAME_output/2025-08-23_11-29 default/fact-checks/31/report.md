### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, Ukraine passed a law, informally known as the "Law on the Prohibition of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine," which bans religious organizations with ties to the Russian Orthodox Church. The law was adopted on August 20, 2024, and entered into force on September 23, 2024. The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations supported the legislative initiative on August 17, 2024.

The law has raised concerns about religious freedom and human rights from organizations like Human Rights Watch and the European Parliament. The European Parliament published a document discussing the ban on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate at the end of August 2024, mentioning concerns from the UN and Pope Francis.
