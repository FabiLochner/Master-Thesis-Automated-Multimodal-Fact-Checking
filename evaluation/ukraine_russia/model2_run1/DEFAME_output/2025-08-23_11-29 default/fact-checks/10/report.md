The Kyiv Independent published an article on July 9, 2024, reporting on a Russian strike in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, that hit a building in the Schevchenkyvskyi district, resulting in the death of a boy.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 8, 2024, Russian forces attacked the Okhmatdyt childrenâ€™s hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine, resulting in at least 42 civilian deaths, including five children, according to Human Rights Watch ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine)). The United Nations also reported on the missile attack, condemning it as a war crime ([https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15761.doc.htm](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15761.doc.htm)).

The Wikipedia article "8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_July_2024_Russian_strikes_on_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_July_2024_Russian_strikes_on_Ukraine)) describes the missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, which caused damage to the Okhmatdyt children's hospital. The Russian government claimed the strikes targeted defense industry targets and aviation bases. The international community condemned the attacks. The image ![image 8](media/10.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image ![image 8](media/10.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image shows the aftermath of the attack, including children's toys amidst the rubble. The claim that the toys were photoshopped is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not photoshopped. The image depicts the aftermath of the attack on the children's hospital, and the presence of toys is consistent with the context. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image depicts the aftermath of the July 8, 2024, attack on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv, as reported by sources like The Kyiv Independent and Human Rights Watch ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine)). The presence of children's toys in the image is consistent with the context of the attack and not the result of photo manipulation.
