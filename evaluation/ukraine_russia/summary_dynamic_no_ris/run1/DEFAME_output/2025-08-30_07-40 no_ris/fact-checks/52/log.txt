Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks): 
Content: The Guardian, published on August 21, 2025, reports that Trump is taking a step back from direct involvement in peace talks, intending for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet first. The article mentions a phone call between Trump and Putin, but it does not state that Trump announced an agreement to end the war. <image:7644>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/europe/timeline-trumps-pledge-to-end-ukraine-war): 
Content: CNN reports that on February 12, 2025, Trump announced he had called Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. <image:1> The article also mentions that on the same day, Trump called Zelensky. The article was updated on March 31, 2025.

The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin did have a phone call on February 12, 2025, and Trump announced he had called Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war.

So, the overall veracity is: false
