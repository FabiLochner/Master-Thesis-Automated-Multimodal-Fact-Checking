## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call, followed by a meeting where Trump agreed to begin peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call). Reuters also reported that Trump spoke with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the same day and ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Putin, likely in Saudi Arabia ![image 7643](media/2025-08-30_07-54-1756540441-864382.jpg).

The Kremlin's website also reported on the phone conversation between Putin and Trump on February 12, 2025, where they discussed a possible Ukraine settlement ([http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. According to Wikipedia, Trump agreed to begin peace talks to end the war in Ukraine after the call. Reuters also reported that Trump spoke with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the same day and ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump *announced* he had reached an agreement to end the war. While the evidence suggests that peace talks were initiated, it does not confirm whether Trump made a public announcement about reaching an agreement.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks direct evidence to confirm the announcement of an agreement.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian reported on August 21, 2025, that Trump was taking a step back from direct involvement in peace talks, mentioning a phone call between Trump and Putin, but not an announcement of an agreement to end the war (![image 7644](media/2025-08-30_07-54-1756540460-452955.jpg)). CNN reported that on February 12, 2025, Trump announced he had called Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides further insights. CNN reported that Trump announced on February 12, 2025, that he had called Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. This supports the claim that Trump made an announcement. However, the evidence does not state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war, but rather that he discussed a possible ceasefire.


## Final Judgement
The initial search indicated that Trump and Putin had a call on February 12, 2025, and that peace talks were initiated. However, it did not confirm that Trump announced an agreement to end the war. The subsequent search revealed that Trump announced he had called Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal, but not that he announced an agreement to end the war.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as Trump did make an announcement regarding the call with Putin. However, the evidence does not confirm that he announced he had reached an agreement to end the war. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially inaccurate. While Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin did have a phone call on February 12, 2025, and Trump announced he had called Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war.
