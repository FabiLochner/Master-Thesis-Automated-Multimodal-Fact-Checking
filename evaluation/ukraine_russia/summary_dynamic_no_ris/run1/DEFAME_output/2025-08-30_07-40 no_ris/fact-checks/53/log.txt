Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: The search result from CSIS states that Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars combined between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The article from Mediazona, updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. The article also mentions that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately 3,000 deaths per week.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)), this was for controlling four regions, not necessarily losses by February 2025. The Russia Matters report card estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured by January 2025. Mediazona estimates around 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)). The evidence suggests a wide range of estimates, and the claim's specific figure is not confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
