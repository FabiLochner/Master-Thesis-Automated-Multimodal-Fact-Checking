The more recent allegations about Zelensky purchasing Hitler's car were supported by more "evidence," including a story from the "Seattle Tribune" that reported the car was spotted in Kyiv just days after the Ukrainian leader was in the United States to meet with President Joe Biden.

**A Fake Story And A Fake News Site**

To further bolster the disinformation campaign, the Seattle Times was filled with other news articles, although those appear to rely heavily on AI-generated content culled from other local news sites.

[BBC Verify's Shayan Sardarizadeh reported](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1843706641000345981 "https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1843706641000345981")
 that not only is there no such news outlet based in Seattle, but that the website was only set up in the past week "specifically to post this fake story."

The effort was almost certainly implemented to raise questions regarding any future support for Zelensky, but also to bolster the Kremlin's claim that its "special military operation" was directed at "de-Nazifying" Ukraine.

**Mixing Truth Into The Fiction**
---------------------------------

What makes this story about Hitler's automobile ending up in Ukraine seem all the more believable is that the fake news site included key facts about the car's history.

The Nazi dictator's Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen was indeed used in the victory parade after Germany defeated France, and it was previously listed by Worldwide Auctioneers in 2018 as the faux news piece reported. [](https://www.forbes.com/)

Misinformation and disinformation campaigns on social media could be increasingly difficult to identify, as new tools and efforts attempt to make the stories seem legitimate. It was reportedly the same car that the German despot rode in during his victory parade after the defeat of France in June 1940. Photos of the car in that news article and on social media appeared to be from the auction house.

This story evokes memories of the infamous "Hitler diaries," which turned out to be forgeries.

**Hitler's Ride Is Now In A Private Collection**
------------------------------------------------

Despite the efforts that were taken, the disinformation campaign was still easy enough to debunk with a few searches. They are rarely driven, period."

Sending a car this expensive a long distance would certainly bring on its own set of challenges.

"It would have to be closely guarded, lots of security, and would probably wind up on a private cargo plane somehow, with a security escort," Earnest continued.

**Details, Details, Details**
-----------------------------

The reporting from the "Seattle Tribune" didn't go into when Zelensky bought the car, but enough truths were mixed in that the story sounded credible.

Those with commonsense might question why Zelensky would spend millions of dollars on the car and bring it to Kyiv, which regularly comes under attack from Russian drones and missiles—but disinformation typically relies on people believing the claim without doing further research or asking such questions.

"The Hitler's car story is an obvious piece of propaganda by those seeking to undermine Ukraine," explained social media analyst Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media. A recent fake news story has been making the rounds this week, citing a report from a seemingly mainstream news outlet.

The story in question suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently spent $15 million to buy a Mercedes 770 automobile that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. In the past, however, the supporting evidence of the dubious claims was little more than photos and anonymous sources.

In July, a post went so far as to show a "sales receipt" for a Bugatti sportscar purportedly bought by Olena Zelenska, wife of President Zelensky. Notably, AutoEvolution.com reported in 2022 that the car is now in the car collection of Australian billionaire Clive Palmer.

"The auction prompted a $7 million bid but the reserve was not met. No word on how much Palmer ended up paying for it, but he did put in two years' worth of negotiations," [the auto website stated](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/hitlers-armored-mercedes-770k-limo-is-now-part-of-billionaires-private-collection-182835.html "https://www.autoevolution.com/news/hitlers-armored-mercedes-770k-limo-is-now-part-of-billionaires-private-collection-182835.html")
. There is no indication that Palmer has sold it.

An attempt to reach out to Palmer was not answered.

However, it would be unclear that Palmer could have sold such a vehicle without it gaining considerable attention.

"It's certainly not unheard of for very high-profile and über-valuable cars to change hands privately, but it typically isn't the norm," explained Brian Earnest, editorial director of _Old Cars Magazine._ "If a seller is looking for the best price, they will usually have their best luck publicizing the sale well ahead of time and turning it over to one of the big auction houses, who attract the wealthy buyers, know who the 'whales' are, and have experience handling and selling 'star' cars and investment grade vehicles."

Earnest said there are "plenty" of high-end exotic cars that have changed hands privately over the years, but it would be doubtful Zelensky could rent a car without it gaining much media attention.

"The car in question didn't sell for a reported bid of $7 million fairly recently, but it's not out of the question it could sell for $15 million," added Earnest."

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/): 
Content: The Forbes article, published on October 9, 2024, debunks the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy bought Hitler's parade car for $15 million. The article states that the story originated from a fake news site and was part of a disinformation campaign. The car in question is a Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, which was used by Hitler. The car was previously listed by Worldwide Auctioneers in 2018. <image:199> The article mentions that the car is now in a private collection.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Seattle Times published an article about Hitler's parade car (<image:7416>). Newsweek published an article about Adolf Hitler's car (<image:7417>). Euronews published an article about a car made for Hitler (<image:7418>).

The articles can be found here: [https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-hitlers-car-ended-up-parked-in-medina/](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-hitlers-car-ended-up-parked-in-medina/), [https://www.newsweek.com/adolf-hitlers-car-will-be-sold-auction-who-would-buy-it-756783](https://www.newsweek.com/adolf-hitlers-car-will-be-sold-auction-who-would-buy-it-756783), and [https://www.euronews.com/2016/12/13/360-video-the-car-that-was-made-for-hitler](https://www.euronews.com/2016/12/13/360-video-the-car-that-was-made-for-hitler).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. A Forbes article from October 9, 2024, debunks the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy bought Hitler's parade car for $15 million, stating that the story originated from a fake news site. The car in question is a Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, which was used by Hitler.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources confirm that the story about Zelenskyy buying Hitler's car is a fabrication originating from a fake news site.

`false`

CNN  — 

Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.

But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.

There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.

China has always claimed neutrality in [Russia’s war on Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. They had been fighting for only three days.

The role of foreign fighters
----------------------------

Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.

A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.

In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.

A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.

“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.

Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.

Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.

“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. [](#maincontent)

CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.

The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”

But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.

![A man rides his bicycle past the building of the Chinese embassy in Kyiv on April 8, 2025.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2208587347.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.

One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.

It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.

It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.

Why the timing matters
----------------------

Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.

The timing is important.

It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.

Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.

From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.

But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.

Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.

“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.

“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.

Beijing certainly saw it like that.

“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.

“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”

The men surrendered. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.

As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.

Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood."

Moscow stages largest Victory Day parade since start of Ukraine war with Putin using celebrations to justify invasion

Russian troops fighting in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.

After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

Chinese troops march through Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day parade in on Friday. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent [admissions from both sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)
 that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

!Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin sitting side by side <image:3185>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day parade in Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

!Russian soldiers march in columns during a parade on Victory Day <image:3188>[View image in fullscreen](#img-5)

Russian troops who were involved in the war in Ukraine march in columns during a Victory Day parade. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Chinese troops have been involved in activities related to Russia, including marching with Russian forces and participating in military drills. The Red Cross Society of China has also been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific actions and purpose of the Chinese Red Cross troops in the context described in the claim.

BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - Chinese Red Cross will provide a batch of humanitarian assistance worth 5 million yuan ($791,540) to Ukraine, consisting of daily necessities, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday.

Russia's invasion into Ukraine last month has sent over 1.5 million Ukrainians fleeing abroad while those remaining in the encircled Ukrainian town of Mariupol were fast running out of out of electricity, heat, food, and drinking water after more than a week of bombardment.

Humanitarian aid supplies sent by the Red Cross Society of China to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society are transported in Warsaw, Poland, March 15, 2022. "The most urgent imperative for the international community is to tackle the potential large-scale humanitarian crisis that might arise in the conflict."

China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting the easing of tensions and make efforts to overcome the humanitarian crisis, Wang said.

The Red Cross Society of China said it provided three batches of emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine from March 9 to 14.These included food, sleeping bags, infant powdered formula, cotton quilts, and waterproof mats.

China has put forward a six-point proposal to ease the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, including that humanitarian action must be neutral and avoid politicization of humanitarian issues, and that effective measures should be taken to protect civilians and prevent secondary humanitarian disasters in Ukraine.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported on April 16, 2025, about the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, who claimed they were acting as individuals inspired by social media recruitment videos. The Guardian reported that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Red Square for Victory Day, with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in attendance. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report in 2023 on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mentioning the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in supporting the response to the conflict.

The sources are: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam), [https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade), and [https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf). <image:1>, <image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about large-scale military drills launched by Russia and China amid tensions with the US, including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3189>). USNI News published an article discussing China and Russia's actions in Ukraine and near Taiwan, also including an image of Chinese troops (<image:3190>). Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, which includes an image of Chinese soldiers (<image:3191>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us), [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Chinese troops have been involved in activities related to Russia, including marching with Russian forces and participating in military drills. The Red Cross Society of China has also been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific actions and purpose of the Chinese Red Cross troops in the context described in the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Chinese troops have been involved in activities related to Russia, including marching with Russian forces and participating in military drills. The Red Cross Society of China has also been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific actions and purpose of the Chinese Red Cross troops in the context described in the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the Chinese Red Cross provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including financial assistance and supplies. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The images show boxes of aid, not troops.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

John Mark Dougan, an American ex-cop, now lives in Moscow and runs a network of AI-powered fake news sites

**A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.**

**A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.**

The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.

Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, [calling it "fake news"](https://www.instagram.com/stories/bugatti_paris/3403151154050783240/)
, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.

But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral.

! <image:1733>!A fake version of an invoice from a Bugatti dealership, with a "FAKE" stamp on it <image:1736>

Several errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.

The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.

Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.

It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort.

It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.

But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news.

At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities.

“For me it’s a game," he said. <image:1733>!YouTube Screenshot of a YouTube video featuring false claims that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion from King Charles III <image:1748>YouTube

A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a £20m mansion from King Charles III

Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics.

One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.

Content: "Car Lovers Group said the invoice is not theirs, and it contains errors that show it's fabricated, including the lack of required legal details and an incorrect price for the vehicle. 

Russian [disinformation networks](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
 have spread similar false claims about Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family in the past year, including a false claim that he bought two luxury yachts for millions of dollars, and a false claim that Zelenska bought over $1 million worth of jewelry at Cartier in New York City.

Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst for cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told CBS News that false stories about corruption are created to undermine Western support for Ukraine and "erode trust in the leaders, their institutions, and international alliances."

The falsehoods play into existing [concerns](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/index/ukr)
 and documented reports about corruption in Ukraine, researchers say.

Darren Linvill, a Russian disinformation expert and professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, said the false claims are "framed for a very particular audience that wants to hear and is ready to hear that and repeat it."

Linvill said the narratives have managed to gain traction online, despite being debunked — likely because of the cost and status of the brand used by the network. Bugatti Paris — which is operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company — [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/C86tVZWKjLS/?hl=en&img_index=2)

 video that falsely claims the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti sports car has racked up millions of views on social media, CBS News has found. The video is part of a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at degrading Western support for Ukraine, researchers said. 

CBS News determined the video was [created using artificial intelligence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)

Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on June 18, 2024.

London CNN  — 

A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of [Ukrainian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple’s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN’s analysis and disinformation experts.

The AI-generated [video](https://x.com/aussiecossack/status/1807774973047758873)
 features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7.

The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Clément Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-[Russian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/russia)
 influencers.

Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and “firmly denounced this disinformation campaign.”

“A supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,” it said, adding that the group “strongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.”

“The mandatory legal details don’t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,” the statement added.

The group also said it has taken legal action “by filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation” – but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed.

Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated “a high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.”

The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media.

A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. “Only minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube.”

 [](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=mfh_reports)
from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September.

A [report by Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections)
, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network.

Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN.

“They scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO."

The summit resulted in a four-point plan and commitments, including £1.6 billion in UK export finances for air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit followed a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump. <image:9> The summit was held at Lancaster House.

In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has demonstrated he wants to have influence in the debate on European security, which has accelerated dramatically since Washington opened discussions with Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine.

"We are at a crossroads in history," he warned on Sunday, March 2, at the [conclusion of the summit he chaired in London](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/eu-s-ursula-von-der-leyen-says-we-urgently-have-to-rearm-europe-after-ukraine-talks_6738734_4.html)
, which was attended by a dozen other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The meeting had been convened by Downing Street a week earlier, but it took on a dramatic turn following the humiliation inflicted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday.

He derided the outcome of the London meeting as "a desperate attempt to pass off as success the failure of a 10-year policy of inciting Ukraine towards Russia by the same Great Britain and, until recently, the United States".

"Europe has no plan," wrote Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia's upper house of parliament.

"And if Ukraine should count on something, it can only be on progress (if there is any to come) in Russian-American relations."

He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hosted the meeting, "cannot fail to understand this".

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025, was a meeting of international leaders in London, called by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The summit aimed to create a "coalition of the willing" in Europe to present a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit resulted in a four-point plan and commitments, including £1.6 billion in UK export finances for air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit followed a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump. <image:9> The summit was held at Lancaster House.

The summit was attended by several leaders, including Volodymyr Zelensky, Keir Starmer, and Emmanuel Macron. <image:1760> Participants agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan. <image:1761>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 10, 2025, about European leaders announcing a new equity fund for Ukraine, which includes a photograph of European leaders (<image:1757>). The New York Times published an article about the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2023, which includes a photograph of a meeting between Zelensky, Starmer, and Macron (<image:1758>).

The PBS NewsHour published an article about the London summit on Ukraine (<image:1759>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, attended by several leaders, including Zelensky, Starmer, and Macron. The summit aimed to create a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the evidence does not contain any information about the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether the leaders took off their suits at the summit.

Nate Vance, who describes himself as a "Republican-leaning independent" and had been generally supportive of the Trump administration on other issues, said he found his cousin's stance on Ukraine deeply misguided.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:2-11)

One of the most notable statements Nate Vance made was calling his cousin and Trump "_Vladimir Putin's useful idiots._" In an interview with _Le Figaro_, he argued that by halting or reducing support for Ukraine, his cousin and Trump were effectively doing Putin's bidding under the false hope of appeasing the Russian leader. ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-newsweek.com_17-0)

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)

The article also states that Zelenskyy's annual income was around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. <image:524>, <image:525>

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, faced criticism from Donald Trump and JD Vance during a tense White House meeting. While Brian Glenn, Chief White House Correspondent at Real America’s Voice, donning a blue suit himself, tried to ‘embarrass’ Zelenskyy by asking him whether he owned a suit or not, the Ukranian president gave it back to him by saying, "I will wear a (suit) costume after this war finishes, yes. 

Who is Volodymyr Zelenskyy? 

------------------------------

  
Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician and former entertainer who has served as the sixth and current president of Ukraine since 2019, most notably during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022. 
As per Forbes’ estimate, Zelensky’s entire real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, including two more wholly owned apartments, two that he co-owned, a single commercial property, and five parking spaces. 'Fight On Your Own...'

  
Meanwhile, on Monday, President Donald Trump ordered a 'pause' on US military aid to Ukraine after a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into peace negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy, known for his calm demeanor despite the confrontation, ultimately left without securing a crucial minerals deal. The Ukrainian president was at the White House for a meeting with US President [Donald Trump](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/donald-trump)
, which ended in an ‘unprecedented disaster’ after Trump, along with his VP, JD Vance, engaged in a ‘shouting match’ all the while ‘berating’ Zelenskyy. 
First, it was about Zelenskyy’s outfit (he wore a black sweater – the same color and cut he has donned every time he’s appeared in droopy military fatigues) that was questioned by an American reporter."

===================================================================================

[The Pandora Papers](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers)

Investigation

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rode to power on pledges to clean up the Eastern European country, but the Pandora Papers reveal he and his close circle were the beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies, including some that owned expensive London property.

Banner: James O’Brien/OCCRP

Key Findings

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize.
*   Zelensky’s current chief aide, Serhiy Shefir, as well as the head of the country’s Security Service, were part of the offshore network.
*   Offshore companies were used by Shefir and another business partner to buy pricey London real estate.
*   Around the time of his 2019 election, Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Shefir, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore.

##### Suspect in Kenya's Anglo Leasing Scandal Used Offshore Secrecy to Obscure Ties to Companies](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/global-shell-game-helped-hide-companies-linked-to-huge-kenyan-scandal)

Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers reveal that Sri Lankan-Irish businessman Anura Perera, named by the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission as a suspect in the Anglo Leasing procurement scandal, was the owner, director or signatory of at least six offshore firms implicated in the case. In general offshore companies are bad, whether they’re owned by a president or not,” Ryaboshapka said.

He called moving money offshore “an old tradition” in Ukraine, because the country was perceived as a dangerous place with “no rule of law.” But still, the use of such companies today raises red flags of “tax evasion or the legalization of dirty money,” he said.

“That’s the essence of offshore companies.”

Actor Volodymyr Zelensky stormed to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019 on a wave of public anger against the country’s political class, including previous leaders who used secret companies to stash their wealth overseas.

Now, leaked documents prove that Zelensky and his inner circle have had their own network of offshore companies. The show starred Zelensky as a humble history teacher whose anti-corruption rant in class is filmed by a student, goes viral online, and wins him national office.

In a case of life imitating art, Zelensky ended up winning the real-world Ukrainian presidency just three-and-a-half years after the show’s launch, with more than 73 percent of the vote.

Zelensky capitalized on widespread public anger at corruption, but his 2019 campaign was dogged by doubts over his anti-graft bona fides, given that his campaign was boosted by media belonging to Kolomoisky — who is [accused of stealing US$5.5 billion](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/oligarchs-weaponized-cyprus-eranch-of-ukraines-largest-bank-to-send-5-billion-abroad)
 from his own bank and funneling it offshore in concert with his partner, Hennadiy Boholiubov.

In the heat of the campaign, a political ally of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko published a chart on Facebook purporting to show that Zelensky and his television production partners were beneficiaries of a web of offshore firms that allegedly received $41 million in funds from Kolomoisky’s Privatbank.

That ally, Volodymyr Ariev, didn’t provide evidence, and his accusations have never been proven. But the Pandora Papers show that at least some of the details in this alleged scheme correspond to reality. / Alamy Stock Photo\

Serhiy Shefir’s brother Borys, who is a part-owner of Maltex Multicapital Corp, said he may indeed be an owner, but was unaware of the details of the offshore arrangement, which was largely the work of Ukraine’s now-Security Service chief, Bakanov.

“Bakanov was our financial director, he set up the financial schemes of our company. Zelensky has not mentioned Maltex in any of his public asset declarations, including one filed for 2018, when he still owned 25 percent of the company.

In such an arrangement, “the real owner has placed another person to act as his or her proxy to pretend to be the shareholder,” Woods said.

“The person making the transfer wants to retain the shares and the benefit of the shares, but doesn’t want other people to know that that is the situation."

In response to questions sent by Pandora Papers reporters, Fidelity confirmed it was the registered agent for Maltex Multicapital Corp, but it said that Zelensky was not currently an owner or beneficiary of any company under its administration.

“The present Ukrainian president is not our client, nor does he have any ownership or any other position in any entity under our administration,” Fidelity said.

The company also argued that there would have been nothing wrong to have worked for Zelensky prior to his ascent to political office in 2019. The chart showed money flowing from the bank via a series of apparent shell entities to companies alleged to have been owned by Zelensky and associates.

Ariev has not provided documentation to back up his claims.

However, the Pandora Papers documents do provide the first corroboration for elements of his allegation: that 10 of the companies that allegedly received the money really did belong to Zelensky and his partners. The financial flows that are visible from the documents appear to be connected to their television production business, of which Kolomoisky was a client.

The leaked documents show the offshore network was set up by individuals behind Kvartal 95 in 2012, the same year in which local media reported that Kvartal 95 entered into a production deal with Kolomoisky’s 1+1 Group.

The Pandora Papers show that SVT Films Ltd, a company that was as of May 2013 half-owned by the BVI holding company Maltex, was to be paid $1.2 million in licensing fees by January 2013 by an offshore company linked to Kolomoisky’s 1+1 network for the television program “Make a Comedian Laugh.”

In 2015, a company called Gimentiano Holdings Ltd, which was ultimately owned by Zelensky’s friend Andriy Iakovlev, also received $750,000 into its account at the Cyprus branch of Kolomoisky’s Privatbank."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

Content: "The series generates approximately $30 million in annual revenue, and [according](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2022/04/20/president-zelensky-is-not-a-billionaire-so-how-much-is-he-worth/?sh=3dcfdb545bb0)
 to Forbes Ukraine, Zelenskyy’s share is estimated at $11 million.

Information about Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s income and wealth can be found in official financial declarations. He explained that during Viktor Yanukovych’s presidency, offshore structures were a way for media businesses to avoid political pressure.

Before entering politics, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a successful actor and producer, accumulating his wealth while working in the entertainment industry before becoming president. Thus, the increase in Zelenskyy’s family income compared to the previous year was linked to the resumption of rental payments.

Regarding savings, financial declarations show that the family’s cash reserves have gradually decreased. By the end of 2022, their savings had dropped by approximately 1.8 million hryvnias, and by the end of 2023, they had [decreased](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-publishes-declaration-unveiling-more-than-317-000-of-income-for-his-family-in-2023/)
 by another 2.8 million hryvnias (about $71,000).

It is notable that Zelenskyy’s financial situation has not changed significantly since becoming president. According to the latest available Forbes data from 2022, his net worth is [less](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/false-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-s-net-worth-is-over-500-million?u)
 than $30 million. While this is a substantial amount, it is not surprising in the case of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he was a successful actor and producer.

The real estate owned by Zelenskyy and his family has remained practically unchanged during his presidency. Myth Detector has published multiple reports debunking such claims:

As the war in Ukraine rages on, rumors abound online regarding Zelenskyy’s net worth, including assets such as homes and vehicles. The site says that the president’s financial disclosure from 2018 listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias, Ukrainian currency. He graduated from Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics with a law degree, but never practiced, according to ClutchPoints.

Thanks for signing up.

Thank you for signing up. Some news sources speculate that tweets declaring the former comedian’s net worth at $1.5 billion were efforts to undermine support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine.

### So how much is Zelenskyy really worth?

According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million — not $1.5 billion. At the time, that gave him a net worth of $1.5 million USD, although, due to foreign exchange rates, the amount fluctuates.

Zelenskyy earned most of his money as a Ukrainian entertainer, starring in Russian-language films including “Love in the Big City,” “Office Romance,” and “8 First Dates.” The tri-lingual president, who is fluent in Russian, Ukrainian, and English, also dubbed the Ukrainian voiceovers for “Paddington”and “Paddington 2.”

From 2015 to 2019, he starred in a political satire comedy series, “Servant of the People.” The oddly prophetic show, which aired for 51 episodes, chronicled the adventures of a high school teacher turned president of Ukraine. In 2019, Zelenskyy ran for office and was elected as president.

Although this marked Zelenskyy’s first foray into politics, he does have the education to back up his recent career change."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A Yahoo News fact-check from Snopes rates the claim as "False". Zelenskyy declared fewer than 15 properties, none in the U.S., and no planes. He has an overseas bank account holding around $377,000, and his annual income was around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. The Times of India states that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million. <image:1>

The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

Myth Detector, in an article published on March 6, 2025, discusses claims about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wealth, stating that his income decreased after the war began and that his net worth is less than $30 million, according to Forbes data from 2022. The article also includes links to several Myth Detector reports debunking claims about Zelenskyy's real estate holdings. [Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) <image:1930> <image:1929>

An AOL article from April 24, 2022, states that Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed assets worth 37 million hryvnias. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million, and his monthly income as president is $930. [Source](https://www.aol.com/much-volodymyr-zelenskyy-worth-160047933.html) <image:1936>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Evidence indicates that Zelenskyy does not own 15 homes, a $35 million home in Florida, or three private planes. His overseas bank account holds approximately $377,000, not $1.2 billion. His monthly income is around $25,000, not $11 million.

Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, and his net worth is less than $30 million. He declared assets worth 37 million hryvnias in 2018.

The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelenskyy and his inner circle were beneficiaries of offshore companies.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including fact-checks by Yahoo News and Myth Detector, contradicts the claim. Zelenskyy's actual assets and income are significantly less than what is stated in the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) show that Zelenskyy's assets and income are significantly lower than what the claim states. His real estate holdings are worth around $4 million, and his net worth is less than $30 million.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio takes part in an interview with CNN on Friday.

CNN

US Secretary of State Marco [Rubio told CNN in an exclusive interview](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/rubio-zelensky-apology-trump-cnntv/index.html)

President Donald Trump suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “not a man that wanted to make peace,” while claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin does want to end the war.

The Russian president by contrast, Trump said, “is going to want to make it, he wants to make it, he wants to end it.”

The comments from Trump came after an earlier meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart [devolved into an angry exchange](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/trump-zelensky-vance-oval-office/index.html)
 over the nature of US support and whether Zelensky had shown enough gratitude.

Asked whether he was considering cutting off military aid to Ukraine, Trump responded: “It doesn’t matter what I’m considering. He also said he was “grateful for the unwavering bicameral and bipartisan support.”

The US Agency for International Development’s $25 million contribution to an initiative to support Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure against Russian attacks was terminated this week, according to a source familiar.

NBC News was [first to report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/state-department-terminates-us-support-ukraine-energy-grid-restoration-rcna194259)
.

**Some context:** The termination was among thousands foreign assistance awards canceled this week and came ahead of President Donald Trump’s contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The money was for the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, which supports the Ukrainian government’s effort to support and repair their energy infrastructure, which has faced relentless Russian attacks throughout the course of the war.

Although the cancellation occurred before the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelensky, it comes amid a radical shift in policy toward Ukraine that has left some longtime diplomats shocked.

“I’m literally sick to my stomach,” one diplomat told CNN Friday.

“I fear for the fallout,” they said, predicting that “no one in Ukraine will sleep well tonight.”

There’s “absolutely no doubt” that the Ukrainian parliament will back President Volodymyr Zelensky after his tense exchange with his US counterpart Donald Trump, according to the head of its Foreign Affairs Committee.

Merezkho said he would like Trump to visit Kyiv and see the situation there.

Merezkho added that the [deal involving Ukraine’s minerals](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-resources-deal-explained-intl-latam/index.html)

“Appeasement doesn’t lead to peace."

Zelenskyy leaves the White House early after Trump meeting gets heated

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)
, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

[!U.S. We're trying to solve a problem."

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

### Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers. 

"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., [said in a statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/28/leader-jeffries-statement-on-white-house-meeting-with-president-zelensky/)

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled."

"He made it hard for the American people to believe he is a good investment," he added. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as well as other Democratic and Republican senators, gathered for an hourlong "encouraging" meeting with Zelenskyy ahead of his visit to the White House, the three lawmakers posted on their social media accounts.

"Just finished an encouraging meeting in Washington with President @ZelenskyyUa and a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss our ongoing partnership with Ukraine," Coons [wrote on X](https://x.com/ChrisCoons/status/1895502158105104419)
, accompanied by a selfie with Zelenskyy, Graham and Klobuchar.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (L) talks with President Donald Trump (R) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, Feb. President Trump was very excited, President Zelenskyy is very excited about this economic deal."

Graham said he urged Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting with Trump not to "take the bait," but he wasn't the only one, sources told ABC News. They noted that Graham was very blunt, telling Zelenskyy to "suck up a bit" and thank the president extensively.

But senators on both sides of the aisle tried to provide Zelenskyy with "friendly coaching," according to two people who were in the room during the bipartisan meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

‘Dummies for Putin’: Democrats defend Zelenskyy after ‘shameful’ Trump meeting
==============================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

Ukrainian leader abruptly left White House after being publicly berated by US president in Russia ceasefire talks

[Democratic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats)
 lawmakers rushed to defend [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 after the Ukrainian leader was publicly berated by [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 in a disastrous Oval Office meeting.

The US president accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war three” while his vice-president, [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
, called the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful”, before cutting short talks aimed at kicking off the process of ending Kyiv’s three-year war with Russia.

Zelenskyy abruptly left the White House soon after without signing a rare critical minerals deal with the US that Trump has said is the first step toward a ceasefire agreement that he is seeking to broker between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

Democratic senators came to Zelenskyy’s defense in statements condemning Trump and Vance’s “shameful” and “disgraceful” treatment of the Ukrainian leader.

In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video

“Every time I’ve met with President Zelenskyy, he’s thanked the American people for our strong support,” Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, [wrote on X](https://x.com/ChrisCoons/status/1895546804739186739)
. “They’re popping champagne in the Kremlin.”

Trump and Vance “are doing Putin’s dirty work”, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, [said](https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1895538251601232175)
 after the calamitous meeting, adding that his party will “never stop fighting for freedom and democracy”.

Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island, also [accused](https://x.com/SenWhitehouse/status/1895538812417425623)
 Trump and Vance of “acting like ventriloquist dummies for Putin”.

Whitehouse was part of a bipartisan group of senators who met with Zelenskyy earlier in the morning before his meeting with the president. The Illinois senator Dick Durbin [added](https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1895528692404900022)
: “The people of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy deserve an apology.”

“Trump and Vance berating Zelenskyy – putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush – is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies,” Durbin said. “We owe him our thanks for leading a nation fighting on the front lines of democracy – not the public berating he received at the White House.”

Adam Schiff, the California senator, [said](https://x.com/SenAdamSchiff/status/1895534637017137234)
: ““A hero and a coward are meeting in the Oval Office today. And when the meeting is over, the hero will return home to Ukraine.”

Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, [said](https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1895535422450909393)
: “What an utter embarrassment for America. The Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said the hour-long discussion showed “strong bipartisan support in the Senate for Ukraine’s freedom and democracy”.

Klobuchar later addressed Vance directly in a social media [post](https://x.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/1895541340265726410)
 saying that Zelenskyy had thanked the US “over and over again” both privately and publicly.

“Our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news)
,” she wrote. Today Trump and Vance are bending America’s knee,” she said.

But Republican senators rushed to defend Trump, describing the president’s exchange with Zelenskyy as evidence that he was “putting America first”.

Mike Lee, a Utah Republican senator, [thanked](https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1895536905103749249)
 Trump and Vance “for standing up to our country and putting America first”. The Indiana Republican senator Jim Banks also thanked Trump for “standing up for America”.

“\[Zelenskyy\] ungratefully expects us to bankroll and escalate another forever war–all while disrespecting the President,” Banks [wrote](https://x.com/SenatorBanks/status/1895543609900089391)
 on X."

The CNN article does not mention any meetings between Zelenskyy and Democrats on that date. The NPR article mentions criticism from top Democratic lawmakers following the meeting.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before meeting with Donald Trump, according to an ABC News article published on March 1, 2025 (<image:7547>). The Guardian also reported on the meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump on February 28, 2025, mentioning that Democratic senators defended Zelenskyy after the meeting and that a bipartisan group of senators met with Zelenskyy earlier in the morning before his meeting with Trump (<image:7617>, <image:7618>).

The ABC News article can be found here: [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439). The Guardian article can be found here: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/zelenksyy-trump-meeting-democrats-reactions](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/zelenksyy-trump-meeting-democrats-reactions).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before his meeting with Trump on February 28, 2025. The Guardian article specifically mentions that Democratic senators defended Zelenskyy after the meeting. Therefore, the claim is accurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators, including Democrats, before his meeting with Trump on February 28, 2025.

`true`

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden’s hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom – from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro’s](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

 !Josh Shapiro speaks during the roll call of states on Day 2 of the Democratic National Convention <image:995>

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and Casey for further comment but did not receive a response at press time.

BERLIN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - There must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday at the start of the Munich Security Conference.

"A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing," Baerbock said in a statement. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on assets of four individuals whom it linked to Mexico-based Cartel del Noreste, including the popular hip-hop artist El Makabelico.

The comment comes after U.S. President Donald Trump startled U.S. This requires tough and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, a strong NATO and progress in Ukraine's accession negotiations with the European Union," she said.

Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – video

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/urbaniulian/posts/10227566798023994)
 claims Germany threatened to cut ties with the United States.

**Verdict: Misleading**

Baerbock did not threaten to cut relations with the United States.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States. That is why I will support Ukraine as long as it needs it, because it is our peace.”

Germany has not threatened to cut off relations with the U.S, according to [Misbar](https://www.misbar.com/en/factcheck/2025/02/23/germany-has-not-threatened-cut-ties-us-after-talks-russia)

Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and his party's main candidate for Chancellor addresses supporters after the first exit polls in the German general elections were announced on TV during the electoral evening in Berlin on February 23, 2025. **[(RELATED: Did Trump Fail To Greet Macron At The White House?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2025/02/26/fact-check-trump-greet-macron-white-house/)

We are increasing the pressure on the Americans so that they have as much to lose as possible if they no longer stand by the side of the liberal democracies of Europe,” she is quoted as saying.

However, nowhere did she threaten to cut off diplomatic relations with the U.S. Check Your Fact checked AFP’s [reporting](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-says-blackmail-of-ukraine-will-bring-more-war/a-71705982)

At the same time, Berbock, in the context of German-American relations, called for waiting for further developments, as "nothing has been decided yet."

"We will increase pressure on the Americans to realize that they have as much as possible to lose if they stop supporting the liberal democracies of Europe," the diplomat stressed.

**German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says European allies should put more pressure on US President Donald Trump's administration in order to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine.**             

Baerbock said on Friday that in order to keep the US as a partner, rather than an opponent allied with Russia, Europe must put pressure on Trump’s administration.

"We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" in order to show them that "they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe," said Baerbock.

Baerbock warned about the new bilateral talks between Russia and the US that took place earlier this week without the presence of Europeans, which aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.

She claimed that Ukraine and by extension Europe could be forced to make painful concessions in a ceasefire agreement.

According to Baerbock, any ceasefire negation without the participation of Europe or Ukraine is "a peace that is not peace but the opposite, further preparation for even more war and violence."

She emphasized that the ceasefire negotiations must take place with the participation of Ukraine and its allies.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday held a phone call conversation, during which the two leaders spoke about "ways to achieve a just peace in Ukraine" as Washington pushed for talks with Moscow without involving Ukraine or Europe.

**Trump increases attacks on Zelensky**

US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Zelensky on Friday.

Trump’s relentless criticism comes amid a wider policy shift on the conflict from the US that included a bilateral meeting with Russia about a ceasefire deal.

In an interview with Fox Radio, he blamed the Ukrainian leader for the start of the war and its continuation.

He also said Zelensky was negotiating for a ceasefire agreement without having any military or political advantage over Russia.

“He’s been at meetings for three years, and he got nothing, so I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest,” said Trump.

Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Friday that he believed Ukraine would soon sign a deal that would grant Washington access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in exchange for continued support in the war.

In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington (<image:1007>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. A fact-check from aol.com states that the claim is misleading, as Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. However, an Izvestia article reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. Press TV reported that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US.

The evidence suggests that Baerbock expressed strong concerns about the US stance on Ukraine and called for increased pressure on the US. However, the exact nature of her statements regarding severing ties is unclear.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, as Baerbock did mention severing ties, but the context and specifics of her statements are not fully clarified by the provided evidence.

The fact-check reveals conflicting information. While one source denies the claim, another reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. The evidence suggests that Baerbock expressed strong concerns about the US stance on Ukraine. However, the exact nature of her statements regarding severing ties is unclear.

Given the conflicting information, it is difficult to determine the veracity of the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

!German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock addresses journalists during the 61st Munich Security Conference (MSC). Sven Hoppe/dpa

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday that she believes European allies should put more pressure on US President Donald Trump's administration to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine.

"We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" to show "that they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe," Baerbock said during an election campaign event in the city of Potsdam, just outside Berlin.

Three years ago when Russia first invaded Ukraine, the German government had proclaimed a "turning point," she said, referring to a much quoted speech by Chancellor Olaf Scholz promising more defence spending.

"Now we need a second turning point" Baerbock said, "no more dithering and wavering for our peace."

The Green politician sounded the alarm over new bilateral talks between Russia and the United States launched earlier this week, amid fears that Ukraine could be forced to make painful concessions in a ceasefire deal.

"A sham peace - that is, a peace that is not peace, but blackmail or a surrender is not peace, but the opposite: further preparation for even more war and violence," said Baerbock. Sven Hoppe/dpa <image:2245>

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock addresses journalists during the 61st Munich Security Conference (MSC). "That is why I will support Ukraine as long as it needs it, because it is our peace."

"No one can decide on war and peace over the heads of the Ukrainians or us Europeans – and that is the clear German position," Germany's top diplomat said.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/europeans-ramp-pressure-us-german-143422657.html): 
Content: Yahoo News published an article stating that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that European allies should put more pressure on the US under Donald Trump's administration to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine. Baerbock said, "We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" to show "that they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe." <image:2245>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Yahoo News article clarifies Baerbock's statements. She did not threaten to sever ties but warned the US that they have "a lot to lose" if they do not support European democracies. This suggests that the claim is misleading, as it exaggerates the nature of Baerbock's statements.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington (<image:1007>). A Wikipedia article discusses the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025, where Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" (<image:i>).

The articles can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-peace-over-heads-ukrainians-europeans-says-german-foreign-minister-2025-02-14/), [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire), and [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting).


### Evidence from `web_search`
A fact-check from aol.com, published on March 4, 2025, states that the claim about German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatening to cut ties with the US is misleading, stating that she did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. <image:1022>, <image:1023>. An article from Izvestia, dated February 21, 2025, reports that Baerbock called for increased pressure on the U.S. regarding its stance on Ukraine and mentioned severing ties. <image:1048>

Press TV reported on February 22, 2025, that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump to prevent a US-Russia alliance, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine. <image:1049>, <image:1050>


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. A fact-check from aol.com states that the claim is misleading, as Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. However, an Izvestia article reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. Press TV reported that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US.

The evidence suggests that Baerbock expressed strong concerns about the US stance on Ukraine and called for increased pressure on the US. However, the exact nature of her statements regarding severing ties is unclear.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, as Baerbock did mention severing ties, but the context and specifics of her statements are not fully clarified by the provided evidence.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals conflicting information. While some sources suggest Baerbock mentioned severing ties, others, including a fact-check, deny this. Further clarification from a Yahoo News article indicates that Baerbock warned the US about potential consequences of not supporting European democracies, but did not explicitly threaten to sever ties.

Given the conflicting information and the clarification from Yahoo News, the claim is misleading. `false`

Content: "President Donald Trump appears not to have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his impending bombshell peace plan for Ukraine, despite Germany’s crucial role in supplying arms and aid to Kyiv.

Scholz spoke to POLITICO on Wednesday, only hours before the Trump administration’s shock announcement that it would conduct peace negotiations over the head of European leaders, effectively ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia and insisting that Europe should provide the lion’s share of military and financial aid.

In his conversation with Berlin Playbook, Scholz said he had been receiving indications from Trump and his advisers that Washington would not perform such a dramatic U-turn on support for Kyiv.

“The talks that I have had with \[Trump\] and that my advisers have also had with his advisers lead to the conclusion that we can hope and assume that the U.S. troops involved in any peacekeeping operation.

The German chancellery has not yet responded to a request for comment relating to the latest developments.

On the question of whether Germany would send troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, Scholz suggested there would be no solution without U.S. is involved, because transatlantic unity must always be guaranteed,” Scholz said when asked whether Gemany would send troops as part of any potential peacekeeping operation.

The fact that the chancellor of the EU’s biggest economy appeared to be unaware of Washington’s plans suggests Scholz’s expectation for transatlantic unity was misguided.

Germany is second only to the U.S. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.

In Munich, Vance is also [scheduled](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-and-germanys-likely-next-chancellor-set-to-talk-ukraine-trade/)
 to meet Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in what will be the first high-level meeting between a member of Trump’s second administration and the German conservatives — who are in pole position to lead the country’s next government after the Feb. 23 parliamentary election.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, meanwhile, criticized Trump’s stance on negotiations with Moscow, lamenting that his administration had “made public concessions to Putin before talks even began.”

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss issues like Ukraine’s potential NATO membership or territorial losses at the negotiating table — not beforehand,” the politician from Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

_Chris Lunday contributed reporting._ will continue to support Ukraine,” Scholz told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook podcast hours before Trump effectively called time on its support for Kyiv as it resists Russia’s invasion.

Later on Wednesday, Trump announced he would begin immediate negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while U.S. “This is the basis for creating the prospect of a peaceful solution that is not a dictated peace over Ukraine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO and said Europe “must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.”

Hegseth also warned his counterparts at a NATO meeting in Brussels that Ukraine would not be able to take back all the territory Russia had seized, and said there would be no U.S. The country has also hosted around 1.2 million Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion almost three years ago.

“We have supported Ukraine over all these years,” Scholz said. in providing military support for Ukraine."

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Scholz rejects ‘dictated peace’ for Ukraine as Europe reels after Trump-Putin call
==================================================================================

Europe

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday said a deal to end the Ukraine war should not be imposed on Kyiv as European leaders warned of security implications on the continent after US President Donald Trump agreed to open negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call.

European leaders scrambled on Thursday to try to get a seat at the table in [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 peace talks after US President [Donald Trump](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/donald-trump/)
 announced the start of negotiations after speaking directly to Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vladimir-putin/)
 in a phone call.

Trump’s move sent shockwaves through European capitals, which want a central role in peace talks because any settlement in Ukraine, hit by a full-scale Russian invasion three years ago, will have ramifications for their own security.

German Chancellor [Olaf Scholz](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/olaf-scholz/)
 warned that the Ukraine conflict must not end with an “dictated peace”.

"The next task is to ensure that there is no dictated peace," Scholz said in an interview with Politico.

[NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 Secretary General [Mark Rutte](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mark-rutte/)
 stressed that [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 must be involved in peace talks and any final deal to end Moscow's war on Kyiv needs to be "enduring".

"Of course, this is crucial – (when) we talk about Ukraine, that Ukraine is closely involved in everything happening about Ukraine," Rutte told journalists ahead of a [NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 meeting defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday.

'Crucial moment of truth'
-------------------------

French Defence Minister [Sébastien Lecornu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/sébastien-lecornu/)
 on Thursday warned that NATO faces a moment of reckoning as the US and Russia set in motion negotiations to end the Ukraine war.

"It's a crucial moment of truth," said Lecornu. Peace, this has unfortunately been the experience over centuries, can only be secured from a position of strength," he added.

Their comments came the morning after Trump took the world by surprise when he announced that the US and Russia had agreed to "have our respective teams start negotiations immediately" on Ukraine during a phone conversation between Trump and Putin.

Following Trump's revelations, the foreign ministers of [France](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/)
, Germany and Spain insisted that any peace deal in Ukraine could not be achieved without the involvement of Kyiv and its European partners.

"There will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans," French Foreign Minister [Jean-Noël Barrot](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jean-noël-barrot/)
 told a foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, while his German and Spanish counterparts added that no decisions could be taken without Ukraine.

Trump's peace push 'not a betrayal', says Hegseth
-------------------------------------------------

US defence chief Pete Hegseth however told reporters on Thursday that Trump's peace plan was "not a betrayal" of Ukraine.

"There is no betrayal there. That's historically true – but the question is, will it still be true 10 or 15 years from now."

His German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, said it was "regrettable" that the Trump's administration had made "concessions" to Russia before peace talks on Ukraine had even started. 

"In my view it would have been better to speak about a possible NATO membership for Ukraine or possible losses of territory at the negotiating table," Pistorius said ahead of the NATO meeting. 

Russia would be remain a threat to Europe's security even if an agreement for peace in Ukraine can be reached, Pistorius added.

"It would be naive to believe that this threat, even after any peace agreement whenever it materialises, would in fact subside," he said.

"That's why we have to invest faster and more in our defence and security capabilities. And so that will require both sides recognising things they don't want to," said Hegseth.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels before the start of Thursday's NATO meeting, Hegseth said it was Europe's responsibility to stop the Russian "war machine".

Hegseth repeated his call for increased defence spending by NATO countries, which he said should ultimately reach 5% of gross domestic product.

The US defence chief told European counterparts on Wednesday that Ukraine's dream of returning to its pre-2014 borders was an "illusionary goal" – and that Kyiv's wish for NATO membership was "not realistic".

Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson on Thursday said Ukraine could still become a NATO member in the future if it fulfils all conditions to join the military alliance.

"I don't foresee the NATO membership as such being off the table for Ukraine," Jonson said before attending the NATO meeting.

'Peace in Europe is at stake'
-----------------------------

German Foreign Minister [Annalena Baerbock](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/annalena-baerbock/)
 on Thursday reiterated the message that Ukraine and Europe need to be involved in [peace talks](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/peace-talks/)
 about Ukraine.

"We can't have talks without involving Ukraine. This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality," said Baerbock, a member of the Greens party.

UK Defence Secretary John Healey echoed Baerbock's comments, insisting that Ukraine and Europe should participate in negotiations with Russia to bring an end to the conflict.

“Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” said Healey."

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV, Feb 12 (Reuters) - [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)
 said both Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin/)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the [war in Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

The conversations came after Trump's defense secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the NATO military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signaling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.

After speaking with Putin for more than an hour, Trump said the Russian leader, who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wants the war to end and they discussed "getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future."

"He wants it to end. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, oversaw billions of dollars of military and other aid to Kyiv and had no direct contact with Putin after Russia's invasion.

Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal.

'ILLUSIONARY GOAL'
------------------

Earlier on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered the new administration's bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying Kyiv could not realistically hope to return to [previous borders](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 or join NATO.

"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.

Zelenskiy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.

Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a member of Trump's cabinet, said such a mineral deal could serve as a ["security shield"](/markets/commodities/top-trump-official-kyiv-discuss-deal-minerals-energy-2025-02-12/)
 for Ukraine after the war.

Trump also said Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will hold talks about the war on Friday in Munich, where Ukrainian officials were expected to attend an annual security conference.

The new diplomacy followed a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap that got under way on Tuesday, which the Kremlin said could help build trust between the two countries.

Russia on Tuesday freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence in a Russian prison, [in exchange](/world/europe/russia-says-its-getting-back-prisoner-us-return-freeing-teacher-marc-fogel-2025-02-12/)
 for a Russian cybercrime boss imprisoned in the U.S., according to a official.

Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.

The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow. Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.

In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.

Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.

Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again.

European powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be [part of any future negotiations](/world/europe/germany-uk-eu-others-pledge-work-with-us-ukraines-future-2025-02-12/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. According to Wikipedia, Trump agreed to begin peace talks to end the war in Ukraine after the call. Reuters also reported that Trump spoke with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the same day and ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump *announced* he had reached an agreement to end the war. While the evidence suggests that peace talks were initiated, it does not confirm whether Trump made a public announcement about reaching an agreement.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks direct evidence to confirm the announcement of an agreement.

Content: "So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

Trump steps back from Russia and Ukraine peace talks for now, sources say
=========================================================================

US president told top advisers trilateral meeting would take place after leaders of the two countries have met first

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. It was not immediately clear whether that was part of the Ukraine weapons deal Trump announced last month.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine."

Reuters also reported that Trump spoke with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the same day and ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump *announced* he had reached an agreement to end the war. While the evidence suggests that peace talks were initiated, it does not confirm whether Trump made a public announcement about reaching an agreement.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks direct evidence to confirm the announcement of an agreement.

CNN  — 

Over the past two months, the United States has been talking with both Ukraine and Russia – separately – to try to fulfil one of President Donald Trump’s main campaign promises: ending the war in Ukraine. On the campaign trail, Trump had promised to end the war in Ukraine in a day.

﻿**February 12:** Trump announces he has [called Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call/index.html)
 to discuss a possible ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia. Moscow illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 – and launched a full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.

Later the same day, Trump calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to inform him about his conversation with Putin and his plans to end the war in Ukraine.

**February 15:** The White House says top officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with [Russian officials to begin talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/politics/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-trump-officials/index.html)

**February 17:** Kyiv and its European allies express disappointment over their exclusion from the talks, stressing that no deal can be done without Ukraine at the table. Meanwhile, Trump criticizes Zelensky, who says he won’t accept a deal made in Ukraine’s absence.

**February 28:** Zelensky travels to the US, where he was [expected to sign a minerals deal with the country](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/01/politics/inside-trump-zelensky-meeting/index.html)
. However, the meeting descends into a chaotic argument between Zelensky and Trump after Vice President JD Vance attacks Zelensky and suggests Ukraine should use diplomacy to end the war, accusing him of not wanting peace.

Vance’s suggestion surprises Zelensky and an unusually public argument erupts between the three leaders.

The meeting ends with Zelensky being asked to leave early, with no sign of a deal.

Watch tense Oval Office argument between Zelensky, Trump and Vance

07:05

**March 1:** The meeting-gone-wrong rattles European leaders, who convene an emergency summit in London to discuss what to do to keep Ukraine armed in its fight against Russia.

**March 2:** Zelensky receives a warm welcome in the UK, where he is [greeted by King Charles III.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-starmer-summit-intl/index.html)

**March 3:** Trump says he will be [withholding shipments of military aid to Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-administration-ukraine-aid/index.html)
. Trump repeatedly touted that he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office if elected president, but there is no sign yet of a real breakthrough.

Trump has walked back from his pledge – first extending the self-imposed deadline to six months, then saying he was being “a little bit sarcastic” about the 24-hour timeframe.

More recently the president said in an interview with Newsmax that Moscow could be [“dragging their feet” on a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/world/russia-ukraine-peace-deal-trump-intl-hnk/index.html)
.

Trump has made it clear that Ukraine will have to acquiesce to his hardline approach if it wants to continue to receive military support from the country.

And while Russia has said it agrees in principle to the US ceasefire proposals, it has consistently come up with “buts” and “only ifs” that undermine any deals.

_Here’s how the ceasefire negotiations have played out_ _so far:_

**January 20:** Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States. An emergency summit is held in [Paris with European and NATO leaders.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/europe/europe-ukraine-summit-paris-trump-intl-hnk/index.html)

**February 18:** US Secretary of State Marco Rubio [meets with Russian Foreign Minister Serge](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/europe/us-russia-riyadh-talks-intl/index.html)
y Lavrov in Riyadh. Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov [describes the talks as “productive and focused.”](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-news-03-23-25#cm8m2mgja00303b6meuhne2sn)

**March 24:** US officials meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.

**March 25:** Russian and US officials meet in the same hotel in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.

By the afternoon, the White House says Ukraine and Russia have agreed to “ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

Zelensky tells a news conference that Kyiv has agreed to stop using military force in the Black Sea but, shortly after, the Kremlin says it will only agree provided financial [sanctions are lifted on key Russian institutions](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/europe/russia-us-ukraine-deal-intl-hnk/index.html)
 – thereby making the deal void.

Following that call, Trump tells right-wing cable channel Newsmax he believes Russia wants to end its war with Ukraine, but that Moscow could be delaying a deal.

“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re dragging their feet. The alliance says it’s [not the time to lift sanctions on Russia.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/world/russia-sanctions-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html)

Zelensky later says the conditions of the minerals deal being negotiated between Ukraine and the US are “constantly changing,” but that overall Ukraine feels positively toward a future agreement.

**March 28:** Four civilians are killed in a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, authorities say. Zelensky also rules out direct peace talks with Putin, saying he would rather negotiate with Russian businessmen or the opposition.

**March 30:** Trump says he’s [“pissed off” with Putin,](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/politics/trump-criticizes-putin-and-threatens-adversaries-with-new-tariffs/index.html)
 telling NBC News he could impose additional tariffs on Russian oil if Putin doesn’t cooperate in ongoing negotiations to end his war in Ukraine.

False video claims Hollywood stars were paid by USAID to visit Ukraine
======================================================================

7 February 2025

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

Stiller visited Ukraine back in June 2022 as a Goodwill Ambassador to honor World Refugee Day. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person.”

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) [confirmed on its website](https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/speeches-and-statements/statement-goodwill-ambassador-ben-stillers-work-behalf-unhcr)
 that “Ben Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel. Ben has been supporting UNHCR since 2016 and has been a Goodwill Ambassador since 2018. We are grateful for Ben’s longstanding support to refugees and forcibly displaced people.”

The video from February 5 claims that USAID paid **Angelina Jolie** $20 million, **Sean Penn** $5 million, **Jean-Claude Van Damme** (misspelled in the footage) $1.5 million, **Orlando Bloom** $8 million, and **Ben Stiller** $4 million to complete their respective visits to Ukraine.

Nearly three years after **Ben Stiller** [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axbhf1Qhe94)
 Ukrainian president **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** “my hero” during a humanitarian trip to his country, the actor is refuting claims that his travels were funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

“Totally false. News watermark, claims that USAID paid various actors to visit Ukraine and has racked up millions of views since being posted on Wednesday, February 5.

“These are lies coming from Russian media,” Stiller posted on X (formerly Twitter). Untrue,” Stiller wrote alongside a video from an account titled “I Meme Therefore I Am” that has been [reposted](https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1887158413597057107)

 to six misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with the performance of election duties. “I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. In a [video posted to his Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfBeCOoIR5L)
 at the time, Stiller said, “I’m meeting people who’ve been impacted by the war and hearing how it’s changed their lives.

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia.

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. 6 tweet.

> [](https://twitter.com/CforCD/status/1854169532924891301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“The tweet attributed to Elon Musk about the alleged ‘last dollar for Zelenskyy’ featuring a bill with Donald Trump’s portrait is fake. This is fabricated content intended for manipulation and provocation,” reads the tweet.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/no-elon-musk-didnt-post-the-last-dollar-for-zelenskyy)
 this claim, saying that Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels spread the fake image, though noted the Ukrainian channels said it was satire.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

**_UNITED24_** **did not report such information, and neither did any other credible source.**

Ukraine has found an alternative to the American satellite system Starlink, a number of pro-Russian sources [report](https://archive.ph/JTBdd)
 citing _UNITED24_. At the same time while commenting on this decision communications officer Ruslana Danilkina allegedly spoke obscenely about Elon Musk in the context of his recent comments about Ukraine.

! On her [personal page](https://www.instagram.com/rusya_danilkina/)
, she also did not publish any offensive comments about Elon Musk, and did not comment on this news invented by propagandists.

For now, Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system, despite the tensions in relations with the United States. They had previously used the _UNITED24_ brand identity to spread the fake that [eight villas of Ukrainian generals burned down in Los Angeles.](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-eight-villas-belonging-to-ukrainian-generals-burned-down-in-los-angeles/)

And secondly, Ruslana Danilkina, who was called a communications officer in the video, does not actually currently hold combat positions in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Electronic warfare equipment manufacturer and former Air Force officer Anatoly Khrapchinsky [considers](https://www.unian.ua/war/starlink-hrapchinskiy-poyasniv-chi-maye-ukrajina-alternativu-suputnikovomu-zv-yazku-12932037.html)
 the Starlink shutdown unlikely: _«Both Trump and Musk are about money. That’s why they won’t give up multibillion-dollar, multimillion-dollar contracts."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The article from StopFake.org refutes a fake story about Ukraine stopping the use of Starlink and insulting Elon Musk. The article mentions a previous debunked fake about Elon Musk publishing a mocking post with the last dollar for Zelensky.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:19> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic X post from Elon Musk on November 6, 2025 saying 'The last dollar for Zelenskiy'."

## Actions
```
web_search("Elon Musk Zelenskiy last dollar")
image_search("Elon Musk Trump dollar Zelenskiy")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The AOL article fact-checks the claim that Elon Musk posted "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and states that the claim is false, with no evidence of Musk posting this. The image of the tweet is fabricated and was spread on social media <image:2360>. The Politico.eu article discusses Elon Musk's meme mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's calls for Western aid.

The StopFake.org article refutes a fake story about Ukraine stopping the use of Starlink and insulting Elon Musk, mentioning a previous debunked fake about Elon Musk publishing a mocking post with the last dollar for Zelensky.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Rolling Stone published an article about Elon Musk and Donald Trump. <image:7648> Axios published an article on November 8, 2024, with a photograph of Elon Musk and Donald Trump. <image:7649>

The search results include articles from [https://www.arabnews.com/node/2578597/world](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2578597/world), [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-trump-phone-calls-world-leaders-1235158569/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-trump-phone-calls-world-leaders-1235158569/), and [https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image of the tweet is fabricated. Multiple sources, including AOL and StopFake.org, debunked the claim that Elon Musk posted "The last dollar for Zelenskiy."


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the image of the tweet is fabricated and that Elon Musk did not post the message "The last dollar for Zelenskiy." Several sources confirm the image is fake and the claim is false.

`false`

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)
 the [already-strict security measures](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-bulletproof-vest-armor-public-events-security-1908361)
 surrounding the Russian leader to an unprecedented degree, unnamed Russian and Kremlin officials told _The Moscow Times_ in June 2024.

The video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A £275,000 Aurus Senat limousine, believed to be from Russian President Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, reportedly exploded and caught fire on a street in Moscow near the country's top intelligence agency FSB's headquarters.

 ![A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/30/550x309/KWHEVD2_1708605928909_1743298840432.jpg "A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)")

The incident is said to have taken place on March 29 on a street north of Moscow’s FSB headquarters, located near the Lubyanka, according to EuroWeekly.

A purported video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader amid talks backed by the United States to end Moscow's war in Ukraine.

In the viral video, workers from nearby establishments could be seen helping to extinguish the fire, which is believed to have started from the car's engine bay area and spread to its interiors.

### Watch the viral video here

Thick smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, whose front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.

It was not immediately clear who was present in the car during the incident, as no injuries were reported, according to The Sun.

It is suspected that the fire started in the car’s engine and quickly engulfed the entire vehicle, EuroWeekly reported.

### **Ukraine war**

Ukrainian government and military analysts speaking to AP expected Russia to launch a fresh offensive across the 1,000-kilometer front line to strengthen its negotiating position ahead of potential talks with Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeastern regions.

Putin escapes assassination bid? stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

The two sides have stepped up their aerial attacks even as US President Donald Trump pushes them to agree to a ceasefire after more than three years of intense fighting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching commitments to not strike energy facilities.

Zelensky also rejected Putin's idea of a “transitional administration”, backed by the United Nations, in Ukraine and said it was Putin's latest ploy to delay a peace deal.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet was involved in an incident near the FSB headquarters in Moscow. Reports mention a fire and an explosion, with videos circulating on social media. However, the evidence does not confirm that Putin was in the vehicle or that he died. No injuries were reported.

The available information is insufficient to verify the claim. The evidence does not provide any information about Putin's death.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet was involved in an incident near the FSB headquarters in Moscow. Reports mention a fire and an explosion, with videos circulating on social media. However, the evidence does not confirm that Putin was in the vehicle or that he died. No injuries were reported.

The available information is insufficient to verify the claim. The evidence does not provide any information about Putin's death.

Vladimir Putin in August 2025

Speculations regarding the health of [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")
 have been a regular occurrence since his rise to power. This is largely speculation and cannot be accredited for authenticity.

Background
----------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\
\]

Further information: [Public image of Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Public_image_of_Vladimir_Putin "Public image of Vladimir Putin")

For approximately 20 years, multiple sources have regularly reported that the [president of Russia](/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia")
 [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")
 is weeks or months away from death or medical incapacity.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 At various points, it has been rumored that he is suffering from terminal [thyroid cancer](/wiki/Thyroid_cancer "Thyroid cancer")
, [blood cancer](/wiki/Blood_cancer "Blood cancer")
, [abdominal cancer](/wiki/Abdominal_cancer "Abdominal cancer")
, [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease")
, [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy")
, serious surgery complications, the aftereffects of a [stroke](/wiki/Stroke "Stroke")
, or that he is, in fact, already dead.[\[2\]](#cite_note-nyt-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)
[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

According to the _[New Statesman](/wiki/New_Statesman "New Statesman")
_, many such allegations are based on "the old Soviet-era practice of [Kremlinology](/wiki/Kremlinology "Kremlinology")
, in which analysts scrutinise the leader's public appearances for signs of physical decline and clues as to who might be in favour or out, in the absence of reliable information".[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

Selected reports
----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Selected reports")\
\]

### 2005 report of stroke

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 2005 report of stroke")\
\]

In 2005, _[The Atlantic](/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")
_ published an essay, based on observation of film footage, alleging Putin had suffered a stroke and was dying.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)

### 2014 report of cancer

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 2014 report of cancer")\
\]

It was reported according to an unnamed German doctor, that Putin was receiving treatment for an "often terminal form of cancer".[\[5\]](#cite_note-ind-5)
 Russian government spokesman Dmitri Peskov denied the claim.[\[5\]](#cite_note-ind-5)

### 2015 report of cosmetic surgery complications

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 2015 report of cosmetic surgery complications")\
\]

Mainstream media outlets in the United States reported that Vladimir Putin might be seriously ill due to complications from a secret cosmetic surgery procedure it was claimed he'd undergone.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 The rumors originated after the Russian president postponed a scheduled meeting from 11 to 18 March, as well as analysis of background objects in official photographs by Russia observers.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)

_[Vox](/wiki/Vox_(website) "Vox (website)")
_ reported that "the idea that Putin would schedule plastic surgery for a week when he was supposed to have multiple public meetings seems highly implausible" and Russian government spokesman Dmitri Peskov denied Putin was suffering any type of medical issues.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 Asked to comment on the report Putin was dying of surgery complications, the Brookings Institution's Hannah Thoburn said "for all we know, he probably has the flu, or just wanted to hang out with his daughters or something".[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 Russian television later aired footage of Putin attending a separate meeting on 13 March.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)

### 2017 and 2020 reports of leprosy and Parkinson's disease

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 2017 and 2020 reports of leprosy and Parkinson's disease")\
\]

In 2017, Russian historian and political analyst [Valery Solovei](/wiki/Valery_Solovei "Valery Solovei")
 asserted Vladimir Putin was about to resign for health-related reasons.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 Putin did not resign.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 In 2020, Solovei and others variously claimed that Putin had cancer, [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease")
 or [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy")
 and would imminently resign, a claim which also did not transpire.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

### 2022 reports of multiple illnesses

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 2022 reports of multiple illnesses")\
\]

Following the 2022 [Russian invasion of Ukraine](/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine")
, according to _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")
_, rumors of Putin being seriously ill became "a subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics, and potential wartime propaganda, even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying".[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

In May 2022, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov reported that Vladimir Putin was simultaneously suffering from "several serious illnesses, one of which is cancer".[\[8\]](#cite_note-graun-8)
 [Christopher Steele](/wiki/Christopher_Steele "Christopher Steele")
 also alleged Putin was "dying".[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

The _[New Statesman](/wiki/New_Statesman "New Statesman")
_ reported there was "no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill"; Russian foreign minister [Sergei Lavrov](/wiki/Sergei_Lavrov "Sergei Lavrov")
 denied the allegation; William Burns, the director of the United States [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
 said "as far as we can tell, he's entirely too healthy"; and [Richard Moore](/wiki/Richard_Moore_(diplomat) "Richard Moore (diplomat)")
, the head of [MI6](/wiki/MI6 "MI6")
 said there "is no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious illness".[\[2\]](#cite_note-nyt-2)
 [\[8\]](#cite_note-graun-8)
[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

On 28 May 2022 the _[Daily Star](/wiki/Daily_Star_(United_Kingdom) "Daily Star (United Kingdom)")
_ even speculated that Putin might have already died of blood cancer.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)
 The _[Sunday Mirror](/wiki/Sunday_Mirror "Sunday Mirror")
_ published its own story the next day also reporting that Putin may have been dead.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

In July 2022, the _[Toronto Sun](/wiki/Toronto_Sun "Toronto Sun")
_ and other media outlets reported Putin had lost use of his right arm due to an unexplained medical crisis. The _Toronto Sun_ cited, as evidence of the allegation, that a video showed Putin swatting a [mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito")
 with his left arm instead of his right.[\[10\]](#cite_note-ts-10)

Neurologists have previously noted that several Russian officials such as [Anatoly Sidorov](/wiki/Anatoly_Sidorov "Anatoly Sidorov")
 and [Sergei Ivanov](/wiki/Sergei_Ivanov "Sergei Ivanov")
 who, like Putin, have specialized training by Soviet-era military and intelligence services and typically make limited use of their right arm, often holding it unnaturally stiff to the side of the torso in what is called [gunslinger's gait](/wiki/Gunslinger%27s_gait "Gunslinger's gait")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-nbc-11)
 A 2015 study by Dutch physicians published in the _[British Medical Journal](/wiki/British_Medical_Journal "British Medical Journal")
_ which compared video of the various officials against body movement instructions in a [KGB](/wiki/KGB "KGB")
 training manual, suggested this was a learned behavioral adaptation to allow quick access to a firearm in response to a sudden threat and probably not a signifier of any medical condition in either Putin or other Russian political leaders.[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)

In December 2022, Solovei announced Putin was being treated with cancer drugs for an unspecified, advanced stage cancer and "the end is already in sight".[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)
 Several years prior, in 2017, Solovei suggested that Putin might resign due to ill health.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

### January 2023 claim by Zelenskyy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: January 2023 claim by Zelenskyy")\
\]

In January 2023, Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 publicly "questioned whether Vladimir Putin was still alive" during a virtual address to the [World Economic Forum](/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum")
 and suggested that Putin might have already been replaced by [his body double](/wiki/Alleged_doubles_of_Vladimir_Putin "Alleged doubles of Vladimir Putin")
.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)

### October 2023 claims of death

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: October 2023 claims of death")\
\]

In October 2023, Russian Telegram channel "General \[of\] [SVR](/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia) "Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)")
" and Solovei said that Putin had died on 26 October from complications of cancer.

Speculation about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s health is only surpassed by theories surrounding the nature of his relationship with U.S. 
\[TASS\]

**Ukrainian President** Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in Paris on March 27, 2025, and boldly predicted the demise of his avowed enemy, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“He will die soon, and that’s a fact, and it will come to end,” declared the man whose leadership through one of history’s more improbable military campaigns has been compared to Winston Churchill’s during the Battle of Britain.

Zelenskyy, who has been targeted by Russian assassins since Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, apparently didn’t expand on the statement. How he expects Putin to die, by poor health or some other means, wasn’t clear. Putin has survived at least a half-dozen assassination attempts and a raft of rumoured health issues spanning more than two decades.

But Zelenskyy’s assertion spawned yet another wave of speculation about the 72-year-old Putin’s welfare after he has spent the last three-plus years directing an unexpectedly taxing war of aggression in Ukraine.

[! The rumours, old and new, have never been proven.

In late 2016, Russian historian and political analyst Valery Solovei said Putin might be forced to step back from his role for health-related reasons. It found this was likely a learned behavioral adaptation to allow quick access to a firearm in response to a sudden threat and probably not a signifier of any medical condition in either Putin or other high-profile Russians.

> Neurologists have noted that several Russian officials typically make limited use of their right arm, often holding it in what is called gunslinger’s gait.

**In 2022**, the General Svr Telegram channel reported that Putin had soiled himself after falling down stairs, and blamed it on “cancer affecting his stomach and bowels.” Other reports point to his “increasingly erratic behaviour,” and there has been speculation about his mental health.

_The New Statesman_ says many such allegations are based on “rumours swirling within the intelligence community and the old Soviet-era practice of Kremlinology, in which analysts scrutinise the leader’s public appearances for signs of physical decline and clues as to who might be in favour or out, in the absence of reliable information.”

“To be clear,” the news magazine’s Katie Stallard added in a piece first published June 2, 2022, “there is no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill. Still less so that he is dead.”  
> _—Katie Stallard,_ The New Statesman

**_The New York Times_** has said Putin’s health became a particular “subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics, and potential wartime propaganda” since the invasion of Ukraine, “even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying.”

William Burns said during his 2021-25 tenure as CIA director that “as far as we can tell, he’s entirely too healthy.” Richard Moore, head of Britain’s MI6, said there is “no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious illness.”

Regardless, evidence that Putin has resorted to body doubles, ostensibly as a defence against potential assassination attempts, is relatively strong. <image:5239>](https://legionmagazine.com/long-standing-rumours-of-putins-impending-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/pu1/)

The article states that these claims are largely speculation and cannot be accredited for authenticity. (<image:k>)

The Legion Magazine article discusses rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death, mentioning speculation and predictions. The article states that there is no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill or dead. (<image:5235>, <image:5239>) The Economic Times reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Vladimir Putin "will die soon." The article mentions speculation about Putin's health.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there have been speculations and rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death. However, there is no verifiable evidence to support the claim that Putin has died. The reports about the limousine incident do not confirm Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.

Content: "Article by Vladimir Putin ”On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians“
==============================================================================

_Article of the President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin_

During the recent Direct Line, when I was asked about Russian-Ukrainian relations, I said that Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole. Vladimir, who was both Prince of Novgorod and Grand Prince of Kiev, still largely determines our affinity today.

The throne of Kiev held a dominant position in Ancient Rus. During a meeting with the republic's leaders, Vladimir Lenin insisted that they act as part of Soviet Ukraine. They were indulged by both the official authorities and local oligarchs, who robbed the people of Ukraine and kept their stolen money in Western banks, ready to sell their motherland for the sake of preserving their capital. Marches and torchlit processions in honor of remaining war criminals from the SS units take place under the protection of the official authorities. In any case, no one has withdrawn their signatures from the Minsk Package of Measures or from the relevant statements by the leaders of the Normandy format countries. No one has initiated a review of the United Nations Security Council resolution of 17 February 2015.

During official negotiations, especially after being reined in by Western partners, Ukraine's representatives regularly declare their ”full adherence“ to the Minsk agreements, but are in fact guided by a position of ”unacceptability“. And what Ukraine will be – it is up to its citizens to decide.4

**Sergey Lavrov:** Mr President, colleagues,

We are always pleased to see you at the Foreign Ministry. To this end, the Foreign Ministry has already established its representative offices in Donetsk and Lugansk, and strengthened the capabilities of the representative office in Simferopol.

I am confident that today’s meeting will enable us to specify all the areas of our practical work on the international stage.

Mr President, you have the floor.

**Vladimir Putin:** Thank you very much.

Colleagues, good afternoon.

I am pleased to welcome all of you and express my gratitude for your active work in the interests of Russia and our people.

We last met in this extended format in November 2021, and since then, there have been many pivotal and even fateful events, without exaggeration, both in Russia and around the world. We will keep doing our best.

**Vladimir Putin**: Thank you.

    [Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's interview with NBC, Moscow, August 24, 2025](/en/foreign_policy/news/2042813/)
    
*   [![](/upload/resize_cache/medialibrary/71f/0bn0pmwfd5j8d8bj19a0o7lhzak9xuqo/267_9999999999_1/С.В. The next thing you know, they will get rid of the officials who made these unpopular decisions under pressure from the West, just discard them as if they were expendable, blaming it entirely on them, and replace them with other officials, also dependent on the West, but with clearer reputations – yet.

Hence, perhaps, the idea of cancelling the next presidential election in Ukraine. To quote, “The right to determine and change the constitutional order in Ukraine belongs exclusively to the people and shall not be usurped by the State, its bodies or officials.” In addition, such actions fall under Article 109 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which precisely refers to the forcible change or overthrow of the constitutional order or seizure of state power, as well as conspiracy to commit such actions.

In 2014, such usurpation was justified by the revolution, and now by hostilities, but it does not change the actual state of affairs. Let me note that they must be withdrawn from the entire territory of these regions within their administrative borders at the time of their being part of Ukraine.

As soon as Kiev declares that it is ready to make this decision and begin a real withdrawal of troops from these regions, and also officially notifies that it abandons its plans to join NATO, our side will follow an order to cease fire and start negotiations will be issued by us that very moment. Its guarantors, as is well known, were the official representatives of Germany, Poland and France."

Newsweek reports that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's presidential fleet caught fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow (<image:5183>), with the cause of the fire unknown and no reported injuries. The Hindustan Times reported on a viral video of an explosion involving an Aurus Senat limousine in Moscow, near the FSB headquarters (<image:k>), mentioning speculation of an assassination attempt, but it was not immediately clear who was in the car and no injuries were reported. The Economic Times reports that a luxury limousine from Vladimir Putin's official car fleet exploded in central Moscow, raising security concerns, and that a video of the burning limousine has gone viral on social media (<image:5206>, <image:5207>, <image:5208>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet was involved in an incident near the FSB headquarters in Moscow. Reports mention a fire and an explosion, with videos circulating on social media. However, the evidence does not confirm that Putin was in the vehicle or that he died. No injuries were reported.

The available information is insufficient to verify the claim. The evidence does not provide any information about Putin's death.


## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "Claims of Vladimir Putin's incapacity and death" discusses speculations about Putin's health, including claims of various illnesses and even death, which have been circulating for approximately 20 years. The article states that these claims are largely speculation and cannot be accredited for authenticity. (<image:k>)

The Legion Magazine article discusses rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death, mentioning speculation and predictions. The article states that there is no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill or dead. (<image:5235>, <image:5239>) The Economic Times reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Vladimir Putin "will die soon." The article mentions speculation about Putin's health.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there have been speculations and rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death. However, there is no verifiable evidence to support the claim that Putin has died. The reports about the limousine incident do not confirm Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires FADEL SENNA AFP

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

French President Emmanuel Macron Olivier Hoslet / Pool / EPA / TASS

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
France 24 ([Source](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220327-macron-warns-against-escalation-after-biden-brands-putin-butcher)) reported that Emmanuel Macron warned against escalating the situation in Ukraine after Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a "butcher" <image:i>. The Moscow Times ([Source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/27/macron-warns-against-escalation-after-biden-brands-putin-butcher-a77097)) also reported on Macron's warning after Biden's comment.

Yahoo News UK ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html)) states that Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during a press conference with Donald Trump on February 24, 2025. Instead, Macron was referring to the killings of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha in 2022. The press conference took place at the White House <image:1433>. The Moscow Times also published articles about Trump <image:1437>, <image:1438>, <image:1439>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 24, 2025, Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump held a press conference at the White House, as reported by [Roll Call](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025) and [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-macron-corrects-trump-after-he-says-european-support-for-ukraine-was-a-loan). Reuters also published an article about the meeting, stating that Macron said Russia was the aggressor, and Trump expressed a desire for a ceasefire <image:1444>.

The transcript from Roll Call does not contain the word "butcher" or any direct quotes about Vladimir Putin.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. According to Yahoo News UK ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html)), Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during the press conference with Trump on February 24, 2025.

The press conference did take place on the specified date at the White House, as confirmed by Roll Call ([Source](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025)) and PBS News ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-macron-corrects-trump-after-he-says-european-support-for-ukraine-was-a-loan)). However, the transcript from Roll Call does not contain the word "butcher."


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Emmanuel Macron did not call Vladimir Putin a "butcher" during the press conference with Donald Trump on February 24, 2025. While the press conference did occur on that date, the available transcripts and reports do not support the claim.

`false`

Main article: [Soviet–Japanese War § Summary](/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War#Summary "Soviet–Japanese War")

As agreed with the United Kingdom and the United States (Western Allies) at the [Tehran Conference](/wiki/Tehran_Conference "Tehran Conference")
 in November 1943 and the [Yalta Conference](/wiki/Yalta_Conference "Yalta Conference")
 in February 1945, the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 entered World War II's [Pacific Theatre](/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War")
 within three months of the [end of the war in Europe](/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day "Victory in Europe Day")
. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Drea-24)
 They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully [concealing the buildup](/wiki/Russian_military_deception "Russian military deception")
 of a force of 90 divisions. This secondary objective was to be carried out by the [25th Army](/wiki/25th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "25th Army (Soviet Union)")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Meanwhile, the [35th Army](/wiki/35th_Army_(Russia) "35th Army (Russia)")
 was tasked with capturing the cities of [Boli](/wiki/Boli_County "Boli County")

The 2nd Far Eastern Front, under General [Maksim Purkayev](/wiki/Maksim_Purkayev "Maksim Purkayev")

*   [10th Air Army](/wiki/10th_Air_Army "10th Air Army")
    

The 2nd Far Eastern Front was deployed in a supporting attack role.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Its objectives were the cities of Harbin and Qiqihar,[\[2\]](#cite_note-Battlefield_Series-2)
 and to prevent an orderly withdrawal to the south by the Japanese forces.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 The front also included the [88th Separate Rifle Brigade](/wiki/88th_Separate_Rifle_Brigade "88th Separate Rifle Brigade")
, composed of Chinese and Korean guerrillas of the [Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army](/wiki/Northeast_Anti-Japanese_United_Army "Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army")
 who had retreated into the USSR in the beginning of the 1940s. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan's surrender.[\[38\]](#cite_note-46)
 Japanese forces were overwhelmed by Soviet attacks. Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks.[\[39\]](#cite_note-47)
 The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.[\[40\]](#cite_note-48)

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die.[\[41\]](#cite_note-49)
 From the Russians' perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia's defeat in the [Russo-Japanese War](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War "Russo-Japanese War")
 of 1905.[\[42\]](#cite_note-50)
 The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing "Beijing")
 by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.[\[43\]](#cite_note-51)

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on. Later, on 8 September 1945, American forces landed at [Incheon](/wiki/Incheon "Incheon")

The invasion of Manchuria was a factor that contributed to the surrender of Japan and the end of World War II.

In September 1945, the [Chinese Communist Party](/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party")
 (CCP) dispatched soldiers to Soviet-occupied Manchuria.[\[53\]](#cite_note-:0222-61)
: 73  The CCP obtained Japanese arms with Soviet help.[\[53\]](#cite_note-:0222-61)
: 73  The Soviet stance regarding the CCP and the Chinese Nationalists oscillated during this period, and in November 1945 the Soviet Union requested that the CCP withdraw from major cities in Manchuria.[\[53\]](#cite_note-:0222-61)

The [Soviet occupation of Manchuria](/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Manchuria "Soviet occupation of Manchuria")
, along with the northern portions of the Korean Peninsula, allowed for parts of those regions to be transferred by the Soviet Union into the control of local communists after the Soviet withdrawal in 1946[\[54\]](#cite_note-62)
 in spite of [a 1945 agreement](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Treaty_of_Friendship_and_Alliance "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance")
 signed between the Soviets and the [Kuomintang](/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang")
.[\[55\]](#cite_note-63)
 The control of these regions by communist governments backed by Soviet authorities would be a factor in the rise of the CCP and shape the political conflict of the [Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War")

Several thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China. [Japanese nationality laws](/w/index.php?title=Japanese_nationality_laws&action=edit&redlink=1 "Japanese nationality laws (page does not exist)")

In late 1949, numerous members of the former Kwantung Army who had been captured in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria were convicted in connection with the activities of [Unit 731](/wiki/Unit_731 "Unit 731")

Main article: [Rape during the occupation of Manchuria](/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Manchuria "Rape during the occupation of Manchuria")

During the invasion of Manchuria, Soviet soldiers killed and raped Japanese civilians.[\[59\]](#cite_note-til-67)
 The most famous example was the [Gegenmiao massacre](/wiki/Gegenmiao_massacre "Gegenmiao massacre")
, Soviet soldiers from an armoured unit massacred over one thousand Japanese women and children.[\[60\]](#cite_note-Ealey-68)
 Property of the Japanese were also looted by the Soviet troops.[\[59\]](#cite_note-til-67)
 Soviet forces responsible for the massacre had carried out the same crimes against civilians in [East Prussia](/wiki/East_Prussia "East Prussia")

According to Soviet historian Vyacheslav Zimonin, many Japanese settlers committed mass suicide as the Red Army approached. reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Manchuria (about 700,000) also looted and terrorized the local people of Mukden and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage."

 the cession of the Liaodong Peninsula. But Russia, backed by France and Germany, compelled Japan to abandon this claim. By means of intrigue and intimidation, Russia then (in 1898) acquired from China a 25-year lease of the Liaodong Peninsula and the right to build a connecting railway from the ports of Dairen (Dalian) and Port Arthur (Lüshun) to the [Chinese Eastern Railway](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-Eastern-Railway)

Content: "This brought on the first armed clash between Russian and Japanese forces in late July 1938.

!Japan's greatest defeat in World War i <image:7767>

In an attempt to halt the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japanese infantrymen board a train bound for the front. The Japanese, by now fully involved in the so-called “China Incident,” ignored the threat.

The Japanese had a low opinion of Russian military prowess, anyway. <image:7765>

The Soviet Invasion of Manchuria led to Japan’s Greatest Defeat
===============================================================

_**Operation August Storm, the massive 1945 Soviet invasion of Manchuria, was Japan’s death blow, and brought an end to World War II.**_

_This article appears in: [Spring 2018](/issue/wwii-quarterly-spring-2018-issue)
_

**By Nathan N. Japanese militarists saw the civil war in China between Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists and Mao Tse-tung’s Communists as an opportunity for a place at the imperialist table and a slice of the Chinese pie, and thus decided to invade China, Manchuria, and Korea.

The Imperial Japanese Army was particularly interested in showcasing its skills. As the situation in China deteriorated, the Japanese Army used a series of staged provocations to eventually invade and seize Manchuria. This move, in the spring of 1931, set the stage for the Sino-Japanese War, which would last until Japan’s defeat and surrender in August 1945.

Although a giant in terms of land mass and population, China was viewed by most Japanese leaders in the 1930s and 1940s as a weak and largely defenseless area ripe for colonization and exploitation. Premier Joseph Stalin became increasingly concerned that the Japanese were getting much too close to his own far eastern borders, and the already suspicious Russian leader began to fear their ultimate goals. Most would not return home alive.

Known as the Changkufeng Incident by the Japanese and the Battle of Lake Khasan by the Russians, it would set the stage for all future conflicts between the two nations.

Essentially, a strong Russian force of about 20 infantry divisions massed on the border of Japan’s puppet state, Manchukuo—formerly Manchuria—to prevent any Japanese incursions. The Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, and the more recent Stalinist purges of his own military hierarchy, simply reinforced an already established prejudice.

When in 1938 there arose a dispute over the exact border between Manchuria, Korea, and the Soviet Union, a high-ranking Soviet defector brought much intelligence to the Japanese Kwantung Army. This defection prompted a local Soviet commander to occupy part of the disputed border line.

Even as diplomatic messages were being exchanged, the ever aggressive Kwantung Army began preparations to eject the Russian “trespassers,” and a Japanese infantry division was rushed to the area."

Content: "Through those severe trials, the finest traditions of friendship and mutual assistance were forged and strengthened – traditions that today form a solid foundation for Russian-Chinese relations.

I would remind you that even before the full-scale outbreak of the Second World War, in the 1930s, when Japan treacherously launched a war of aggression against China, the Soviet Union extended a helping hand to the Chinese people. How should China and Russia jointly defend their shared historical memory at a time when some forces on the international stage are attempting to distort historical truth?

**V.Putin:** As I have already noted, this year, together with our Chinese friends, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War and the capitulation of militarist Japan, which marked the end of the Second World War.

The peoples of the Soviet Union and China bore the brunt of the fighting and suffered the heaviest losses. In 1945, the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation played a decisive role in liberating northeast China, dramatically altering the situation in the Far East and making the capitulation of militarist Japan inevitable.

In Russia, we will never forget that China's heroic resistance was one of the crucial factors that prevented Japan from stabbing the Soviet Union in the back during the darkest months of 1941–1942. Japanese militarism is being revived under the pretext of imaginary Russian or Chinese threats, while in Europe, including Germany, steps are being taken towards the re-militarisation of the continent, with little regard for historical parallels.

Russia and China resolutely condemn any attempts to distort the history of the Second World War, glorify Nazis, militarists and their accomplices, members of death squads and killers, or to defame Soviet liberators. To mark the 80th anniversary of the USSR's Victory in the Great Patriotic War, China's Victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, and the founding of the United Nations, we signed a Joint Statement on Further Deepening the China–Russia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for a New Era. What are your plans for further promoting high-quality, mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Russia?

**V.Putin:** Economic relations between Russia and China have reached an unprecedented level. What prospects do you see for further promoting ties between the peoples of China and Russia?

**V.Putin:** Large-scale bilateral cultural and humanitarian initiatives make a significant contribution to fostering friendly relations. The Russia-China Roadmap for Humanitarian Cooperation until 2030, which includes more than 100 major projects, is being consistently implemented.

I would particularly highlight the successful organisation of the Russia and China Years of Culture, held in 2024–2025 and timed to the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. This is undoubtedly a strategic dimension of our relationship, helping to build a broad public base of friendship, good-neighbourliness, and mutual understanding.

**Question**: The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), jointly established by China and Russia, serves as an important platform for comprehensive regional cooperation, crucial for ensuring peace, stability, and development across the Eurasian space. In your view, in which areas should member states further strengthen exchanges and cooperation?

**V.Putin:** The establishment of the SCO in 2001 embodied the shared aspiration of Russia, China, and the Central Asian states – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan – to build trust, friendship, and good-neighbourly relations, and to promote peace and stability in the region.

Over the years, the SCO has developed a solid legal and institutional framework, creating mechanisms that enable effective cooperation in politics, security, trade and investment, as well as cultural and humanitarian exchanges."

Content: "China, Russia leaders' statement avoided wording that could irk Japan
=====================================================================

![KYODO NEWS](/mwimgs/7/2/-/img_727acdf405521b5840c6a46ca2e266d649734.png)[KYODO NEWS](/list/partners/kyodo_news)

BEIJING - A joint statement signed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin earlier this month avoided wording that could irk Japan, with Beijing asking to remove such reference so as not to damage ties with the neighboring country, diplomatic sources said Sunday.

The deletion apparently indicates the Chinese leadership's attempt to stabilize its relations with Japan, a U.S. (Kyodo) ==Kyodo

The sources said the draft joint statement originally referred to the two countries' commitment to "maintaining the security of Northeast Asia," which could suggest increased joint military activities by them in the vicinity of Japan.

Japan has repeatedly expressed concerns over joint military exercises between the two countries, including concerted bomber flights and warship navigation, near its territory.

The draft joint statement on deepening China-Russia strategic partnership also says Moscow welcomes investment by Chinese companies in a special economic zone on a group of Russian-held islands claimed by Japan, and that Beijing will cautiously study the possibility, according to the sources.

This sentence regarding the disputed islands, which are called the Northern Territories by Japan and the Southern Kurils by Russia, was eventually deleted, they said. The Chinese leader also watched a military parade in Moscow's Red Square.

Russia and China have been strengthening their ties in recent years, with Beijing opposing Western sanctions on Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine that started in February 2022.

Xi and Putin pledged to resolutely respond to Washington's "dual containment" policy toward them, according to the joint statement.

The released document urged Japan to "draw lessons from the atrocious crimes it committed" and be "cautious in its words and deeds" on historical issues, and distance itself from militarism.

Putin told Xi that he would be "glad" to visit China to attend a ceremony in September to mark the 80th anniversary of what Beijing calls its victory in the 1937-1945 War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.

Masayuki Masuda, head of the China division at the Tokyo-based National Institute for Defense Studies, said the reference to deeper Beijing-Moscow military collaboration in Northeast Asia "could have triggered a backlash from Japan, the United States and South Korea."

China probably did not want the document to paint a picture of "a Japan-U.S.-South Korea alliance versus the China-Russia-North Korea camp," he said.

Russia and North Korea have also been expanding bilateral military cooperation under a partnership treaty signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June last year.

North Korea is believed to have received technical assistance from Russia for its military development in exchange for sending troops to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine.

The drafting of the document started in earnest late last year, with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi leading the process, the sources said, adding that the paper was revised several times.

Xi visited Moscow earlier this month for his summit with Putin and to attend a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, which Russia observes as Victory Day."

 and threats coming from North Korea risk transforming the region into a future flashpoint.

"The international society is in a new crisis era as it faces the biggest challenges since the end of World War II,” Japan’s Defense Ministry said in [**an annual report**](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/14/japan-warns-of-chinas-military-moves-as-biggest-strategic-challenge-00452924)
 released in July that cited China’s growing military cooperation with Russia and an escalating US-China rivalry as chief security concerns for the region.

**How Does China-Russia Security Cooperation Affect The Pacific?**
------------------------------------------------------------------

China's Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said that the August 1-5 drills are not aimed at any other country or related to the current international or regional situation, but Japan has [**continued to warn**](https://apnews.com/article/japan-china-us-north-korea-security-pacific-23f5c8e0b5f539dcf8b33261e74f7427)
 that the tightening cooperation could lead to growing tensions in the future.

In its annual defense report, Tokyo said that some of Russia’s newest military hardware has been deployed to the Pacific and that Moscow has added troops, missiles, and warplanes to islands north of Japan, which the Soviet Union took toward the end of World War II, but which Japan says are sovereign Japanese territory illegally occupied by Russia.

[Chart: Joint Russia-China Military Exercises](/a/military-exercise-japan-taiwan-navy-china-russia-partnership/33279379.html?layout=1)

Tokyo also says that Russia maintains active military operations around Japan and has violated its airspace. In light of these developments, Japan's Defense Ministry warned in July that increased strategic cooperation between Beijing and Moscow -- including enhanced military exercises -- pose “strong concern” for the country’s security.

Japan also recently echoed similar concerns raised in the past by the European Union and [**Asian governments**](https://www.reuters.com/world/salami-tactics-philippines-ukraine-tyranny-time-2024-09-20/)
 like Taiwan and the Philippines that Russia’s three-and-a-half-year-old full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Beijing’s continued economic and political backing for Moscow amid the war, could negatively affect the security situation in Asia.

[Map: Joint Russia-China Military Exercises In 2024](/a/military-exercise-japan-taiwan-navy-china-russia-partnership/33279375.html?layout=1)

“The security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific is inseparable,” the Japanese Defense Ministry report said, warning that a Ukraine-like war is possible in the region without going into specifics.

**Why Are China and Russia’s Militaries Training Together?**
------------------------------------------------------------

While China and Russia do not have a formal military alliance, CSIS noted in its report tracking China-Russia military cooperation that “joint exercises are a newer and thriving element of China-Russia military ties and a driver behind the strengthening of China-Russia relations in recent years” that bring several benefits, particularly for Beijing.

China, Russia Launch Joint Naval Drills In Pacific Amid Strengthening Military Ties

China and Russia have kicked off joint naval exercises near the coast of the Russian port city of Vladivostok as the two countries continue to deepen their ties through military cooperation.

The five-day exercises that opened on August 1 have been dubbed Maritime Interaction 2025 and will see naval forces from both countries training in anti-submarine warfare, air defense, search-and-rescue operations, and “joint gun” exercises, [**according**](https://tass.com/defense/1995947)
 to a statement from Russia’s Pacific Fleet.

The first two days consisted of land-based drills near Vladivostok and on August 3, the Russian and Chinese navies started carrying out live-fire artillery and anti-submarine drills off the coast in the Sea of Japan. He has also written for The Atlantic and The Washington Post.

China, Russia Launch Joint Naval Drills In Pacific Amid Strengthening Military Ties

!China's navy holds a welcome ceremony as a Russian naval ship arrives in Zhanjiang, southern China, in 2016. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted the Pacific Fleet as saying Russian and Chinese vessels were moving in a joint detachment including a large Russian anti-submarine ship and two Chinese destroyers.

The drills are annual naval exercises between Chinese and Russian forces that are part of an accelerating trend of strengthening security ties through bilateral and multilateral exercises. According to [**The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)**](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-russia-military-cooperation-arms-sales-exercises/)
, a Washington-based think tank, Beijing and Moscow have carried out 113 combined exercises since 2003.

But in a sign of the quickening pace of their cooperation, half of that total has taken place in the last six years alone. China-Russia joint exercises have a wide geographic reach but have become especially concentrated in the Pacific in recent years. Here's What It's Learning.")

[**According to the study**](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-russia-military-cooperation-arms-sales-exercises/)
, enhanced exercises allow the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), China’s military, to “gain valuable experience operating with the far more experienced Russian military and afforded the PLA opportunities to practice maneuvering in a variety of geographies and climates far from China’s borders.”

An [**analysis published in May**](https://merics.org/en/comment/joint-military-exercises-signal-deepening-russia-china-strategic-alignment)
 by the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), a Berlin-based think tank, also noted that the growing number of exercises “serve operational purposes while also signalling political alignment against regional rivals” as both Beijing and Moscow look to challenge the United States and its allies in the Pacific and elsewhere.

In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik on July 25, 2024, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad meets with Russian president at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 24, 2024. Many Alawites were part of Assad’s government, while the former dictator himself is a member of the group, per the outlet.

Social media users are claiming to show Assad’s Russian passport, the country where Assad fled after his regime fell. ‘Aleksandrovich’ is a [patronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)
, “Imyarek” is a placeholder family name,” reads the image description.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/edited-image-passed-off-as-bashar-al-assads-asylum-passport-in-russia)
 the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image of the Russian passport is fake and photoshopped. An AOL article explicitly states that the image has been debunked. Additionally, the NV article mentions that Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, which does not imply that he has a Russian passport.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL article fact-checks an image of a Russian passport purportedly belonging to Bashar al-Assad and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The article also mentions that Logically Facts debunked the claim. (<image:2651>) The Wikipedia article discusses Bashar al-Assad's presidency and mentions that he was born in Damascus on September 11, 1965. (<image:21>)

An article from NV mentions that Bashar Assad's regime collapsed and he fled to Moscow. (<image:2674>)

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

From [Source](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/): 
Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Putin’s Real _Casus Belli_: Ukrainian Democracy
-----------------------------------------------

Amazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break Ukraine’s democracy. After Putin’s annexation and ongoing support for the war in Donbas, Ukrainians are now more united across ethnic, linguistic, and regional divides than at any other point in Ukrainian history.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

The session revealed deep divisions within the GOP on U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (R) looks on as U.S. [Mitch McConnell](https://kyivindependent.com/mcconnells-exit-signals-shift-in-republican-support-for-ukraine/)
 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

Content: "This might be intended to distract Russian forces.

“By launching surprise offensives across the thinly defended border, Ukraine can pursue operational-level guerrilla warfare to support an overall strategy of exhaustion,” [says Robert Rose](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/the-kursk-offensive-how-ukraines-operational-level-guerrilla-warfare-is-bringing-maneuver-back/)
 of the Modern War Institute at West Point.

Despite the gathering Russian counterattack in Kursk, and mounting Ukrainian losses, Zelensky insists the incursion into Kursk is necessary and valuable, and has slowed Russian advances in eastern Donetsk, where the city of Pokrovsk is under immediate threat. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is seeking to fully capture four eastern Ukrainian regions he already partly controls, and most of the fighting in the war has focused on this area.

Zelensky told Fareed Zakaria Friday that Russia’s [guided aerial bombs](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/10/europe/russian-guided-bomb-ukraine-frontline-intl/index.html)
, known as FABs, were responsible for 80% of destroyed infrastructure – and Ukraine urgently needed to hit the airfields from which they are launched.

This appeal appears to be gaining traction. [](#maincontent)

A [Russian counteroffensive](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/russia-launches-kursk-counteroffensive-intl/index.html)
 to recover parts of Kursk lost to Ukrainian forces following a surprise, cross-border attack is underway but is yet to gain momentum.

Ukraine launched its assault last month, capturing scores of settlements, a move that stunned even Kyiv’s allies. The officer said poor communications were hampering their operations.

Zelensky told a panel in Kyiv Friday moderated by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that Russia’s advantage in artillery ammunition in the Pokrovsk area had been cut from 12-to-1 to 2.5-to-1, which he attributed to the success of the Kursk campaign.

“The speed \[of the Russian advance\] in the Donetsk sector was even faster before the Kursk operation. The Kremlin appears to prioritize the goal of progress in Donetsk over retrieving lost Russian territory – for now.

The Ukrainians have offered several reasons for the Kursk operation – that it would force Russia to redeploy troops currently committed on the front-lines in Ukraine; that it would provide Ukraine with land to trade in any negotiations; that it would make a mockery of Putin’s ‘red lines’; and that it would provide a pool of prisoners-of-war to exchange (which it already has.)

Zelensky claims that the Kursk operation has shown [Putin’s warnings](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/world/putin-response-ukraine-kursk-intl/index.html)
 about the consequences of escalation to be hollow.

Zelensky has now added another justification for the Kursk offensive: that it forestalled a Russian plan to take a large swathe of northern Ukraine as a buffer zone, a plan that would have swallowed “regional centers.”

He told the Kyiv panel that “information from our partners” indicated that the Russians intended to create “security zones” deep inside Ukraine.

The ISW, a think-tank in Washington DC, said Friday that the Russian military command may have intended “additional offensive operations along a wider and more continuous front in northeastern Ukraine to significantly stretch Ukrainian forces.”

For now, such Russian ambitions are on hold. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at his meeting Friday with US President Joe Biden that “the next few weeks and months could be crucial – very, very important that we support Ukraine in this vital war of freedom.”

But the Biden Administration is wary of the consequences of what the Kremlin sees as an escalation that would bring NATO directly into the conflict.

The Kursk incursion may encourage Ukraine to develop another tool that “could fundamentally change Ukraine’s approach to fighting,” according to Rose at the Modern War Institute.

“Ukraine cannot use manoeuvre to achieve a decisive victory over Russia. What it can do is use manoeuvre to exploit vulnerabilities, force Russia to over-extend, create chaos, encircle Russian forces, and capture Russian equipment.”

The crux, according to Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven Associate Professor of National Security, is how Ukraine changes Putin’s decision-making, whether in Kursk or by much deeper strikes inside Russia, or both.

“Does it make him negotiate? Both the quality and number of Russian troops committed to the region are hazy, and reliable frontline accounts are few and far between.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the start of Russia’s counteoffensive and says it intends to deploy 60,000 – 70,000 troops in the Kursk region."

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Western analysts have offered differing explanations for the Kursk offensive – including the diversion of Russian troops and a psychological reset through seizing the initiative. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24240624343613-1724950393.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."
