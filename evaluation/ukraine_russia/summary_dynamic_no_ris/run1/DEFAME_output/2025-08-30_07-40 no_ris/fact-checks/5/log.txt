Content: The Forbes article, published on October 9, 2024, debunks the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy bought Hitler's parade car for $15 million. The article states that the story originated from a fake news site and was part of a disinformation campaign. The car in question is a Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, which was used by Hitler. The car was previously listed by Worldwide Auctioneers in 2018. <image:199> The article mentions that the car is now in a private collection.
