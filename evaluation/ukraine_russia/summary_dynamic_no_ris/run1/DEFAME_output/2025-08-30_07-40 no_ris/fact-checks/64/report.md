## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
France 24 ([Source](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220327-macron-warns-against-escalation-after-biden-brands-putin-butcher)) reported that Emmanuel Macron warned against escalating the situation in Ukraine after Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a "butcher" <image:i>. The Moscow Times ([Source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/27/macron-warns-against-escalation-after-biden-brands-putin-butcher-a77097)) also reported on Macron's warning after Biden's comment.

Yahoo News UK ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html)) states that Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during a press conference with Donald Trump on February 24, 2025. Instead, Macron was referring to the killings of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha in 2022. The press conference took place at the White House ![image 1433](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508911-381476.jpg). The Moscow Times also published articles about Trump ![image 1437](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508925-322359.jpg), ![image 1438](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508925-485300.jpg), ![image 1439](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508925-668467.jpg).


### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 24, 2025, Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump held a press conference at the White House, as reported by [Roll Call](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025) and [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-macron-corrects-trump-after-he-says-european-support-for-ukraine-was-a-loan). Reuters also published an article about the meeting, stating that Macron said Russia was the aggressor, and Trump expressed a desire for a ceasefire ![image 1444](media/2025-08-06_19-42-1754509362-961709.jpg).

The transcript from Roll Call does not contain the word "butcher" or any direct quotes about Vladimir Putin.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. According to Yahoo News UK ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html)), Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during the press conference with Trump on February 24, 2025.

The press conference did take place on the specified date at the White House, as confirmed by Roll Call ([Source](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025)) and PBS News ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-macron-corrects-trump-after-he-says-european-support-for-ukraine-was-a-loan)). However, the transcript from Roll Call does not contain the word "butcher."


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Emmanuel Macron did not call Vladimir Putin a "butcher" during the press conference with Donald Trump on February 24, 2025. While the press conference did occur on that date, the available transcripts and reports do not support the claim.

`false`
