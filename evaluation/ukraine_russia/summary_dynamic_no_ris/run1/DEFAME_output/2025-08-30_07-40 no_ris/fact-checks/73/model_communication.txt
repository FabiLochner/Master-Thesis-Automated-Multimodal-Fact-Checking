# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has F-16 fighter jets. The Politico.eu article mentions a Ukrainian pilot who died in an F-16 crash. However, the evidence does not confirm the cause of the crash or whether it was shot down by Russia.

The image search results do not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows an F-16 shot down by Russia. More information is needed to confirm the cause of the crash and the identity of the aircraft in the image.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

> Oleksiy "Moonfish" Mes perished in the F-16AM s/n 80-3600 (ex-Royal Danish Air Force s/n E-600). The accident occurred on the very first day of combat usage of the F-16 Fighting Falcon by the Ukrainian Air Force. 
  
NASA Sentinel-2 satellite imagery shows a crash site located in the vicinity of Kurhany in Rivne Oblast. It appears that the aircraft crashed into the ground largely in one piece, resulting in one large debris site, albeit with a significant fire spread. 
  
On 26 August, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky espoused the effectiveness of the Western origin F-16s in supposedly repelling a mass Russian strike, but made no mention of any aircraft losses. An official statement released by the General Staff read (translated):  
  
"F-16 fighters of the Ukrainian Air Force were used together with anti-aircraft missile units during repulse of a missile attack by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine."

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. Only a small number of the country’s top pilots have been trained to fly F-16s, the most advanced of Ukraine’s fighter jets. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. We cannot remain bound by conditions when the enemy has no restrictions,” Roman Kostenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, said in a statement.

According to the United Nations, Ukraine is the most heavily mined country in the world. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines."

Content: "As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died.”

!Ukraine receives its first F-16 fighter jets <image:7898>

F-16 Fighting Falcons are seen as President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky delivers a speech congratulating the Ukrainian military on the stand in front of the first General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon received by Ukraine on August 4, 2024 in, Ukraine. A PSU representative, speaking to multiple outlets, later stated, “different versions \[of the crash\] are being considered, including the ‘friendly fire’ of their air defence systems, a technical malfunction and pilot error.” (That doesn’t rule out friendly fire, but stops well short of confirming it; a final answer is likely to only come out following a thorough review.)

One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles.  These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.

This version is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence, as one of the same industry executives told Breaking Defense that “earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.”

“There were two MiG-29s and two Sukhoi models lost in this way,” he continued. !Funeral Takes Place Of Downed Ukrainian Pilot <image:7895>

The rite of burial of Ukrainian F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes, on the Day of Remembrance for Fallen Heroes, as hundreds attended a farewell ceremony for the deceased tactical aviation pilot in the central square of the city on August 29, 2024 in Shepetivka, in Khmelnytskyi Oblast (province) Ukraine. Oleksiy Mes, an F-16 pilot, died on August 26 as a result of an air crash during one of the largest massive missile attacks on Ukraine. Others wondered if the crash showed that the F-16 wasn’t even fit for [Ukraine’s](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/Ukraine/)
 mission. The loss of an F-16 so soon after having received them means the issue is “doubly sensitive, if not more so, and no one is talking officially,” according to one high-ranking defense industry executive.

But some details of the incident have come out, and sources have helped fill in some gaps for Breaking Defense, including around the theory that the loss was the result of shrapnel that hit the plane.

With it comes a picture of an incredibly dangerous mission where the loss of jets may have been more a question of when, not if — a deadly reality that, Ukrainian experts say, is being exacerbated by the patchwork of capabilities Kyiv has been forced to use in its defense.

Integration Challenge

However, the jets are only part of the complex operational sphere.

Ukrainian defense industry specialists, who are closely intertwined with the military and support both the air defense units and F-16s, told Breaking Defense that these missile intercept missions involving fighter aircraft and air defense batteries operating jointly require precision coordination.

Complicating this coordination, multiple sources said, is the fact that neither the PSU fighters nor the air defense units on the ground are using IFF in these engagements. (The MoD and PSU did not return requests for comment on the use of IFF by press time.)

This caused several industry and military sources — and even a [member of the Ukraine parliament](https://ukranews.com/en/news/1030564-friendly-fire-considered-as-one-of-versions-of-f-16-plane-crash-voice-of-america#google_vignette)
 — to claim the F-16 was a victim of friendly fire. It is a dangerous mission, and I fear more aircraft will be lost in this same tragic manner.”

Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukrainian-pilot-oleksiy-mes-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-crash-war-in-ukraine-russia-attack/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukrainian-pilot-oleksiy-mes-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-crash-war-in-ukraine-russia-attack/)) published an article about a Ukrainian pilot who died in an F-16 fighter jet crash. <image:7865>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has F-16 fighter jets. The Politico.eu article mentions a Ukrainian pilot who died in an F-16 crash. However, the evidence does not confirm the cause of the crash or whether it was shot down by Russia.

The image search results do not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows an F-16 shot down by Russia. More information is needed to confirm the cause of the crash and the identity of the aircraft in the image.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report on the crash of Ukrainian F-16 fighter jets. The Aviation Safety Network ([https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/415138](https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/415138)) states that an F-16 crashed on August 26, 2024, in Kurhany, Rivne Oblast, Ukraine, during a Russian Federation missile and drone strike, killing the pilot. CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia)) reported on June 29, 2025, about another F-16 crash and the death of a pilot. Breaking Defense ([https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/debris-and-a-deadly-mission-the-vital-context-around-ukraines-lost-f-16/](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/debris-and-a-deadly-mission-the-vital-context-around-ukraines-lost-f-16/)) also discusses an F-16 crash, noting the pilot's death and that the cause is under investigation. <image:1>, <image:7895>, <image:7898>, <image:7899>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results include an image of a destroyed F-16 aircraft from en.defence-ua.com ([https://en.defence-ua.com/news/image_of_destroyed_ukrainian_f_16_aircraft_near_odesa_emerges_as_belgian_incident-8983.html](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/image_of_destroyed_ukrainian_f_16_aircraft_near_odesa_emerges_as_belgian_incident-8983.html)) <image:7902>.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian F-16 fighter jets have crashed. The Aviation Safety Network reports a crash on August 26, 2024, during a Russian Federation missile and drone strike. Other sources also report on F-16 crashes and pilot deaths. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts an F-16 shot down by Russia.

A supposed [photo](https://x.com/pmigse/status/1928413287043002498)
 of a destroyed Ukrainian Air Force base after a bombardment by Russian Iskanders is being circulated online. <image:7930>

Original [image](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1005437225128772&set=a.806932641645899)
 shared by the Facebook account “Military Aviation”

Certain details of the original image indicate it was generated by AI. <image:7932>

Fire spots at the base

The wreckage of the destroyed aircraft is scattered too chaotically and does not match the trajectory of a real explosion. However, they do not yet form the core of Ukraine’s combat fleet, making it unlikely that so many F-16s would be stationed at a single base. <image:7934>

22 august 2025 year It shows destroyed F-16 aircraft.

**However, this is a photo fake. <image:7929>

Screenshot of the [post](https://x.com/pmigse/status/1928413287043002498)

Using reverse search, we found that the image was first shared by the Facebook page “Military Aviation”. This is a common occurrence when AI generates a complex image with many elements: the tool prioritizes overall composition, sacrificing the accuracy of individual details, especially the background and corners.! <image:7931>

Error in the aircraft design made by AI

Although fires and smoke are visible in the background, the allegedly damaged planes in the foreground do not show clear signs of burning, melted metal, or soot, which would be typical for such large-scale destruction. Such a concentration of destroyed planes along with completely intact ones in a small area looks unrealistic."

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to the media in front of an F-16

One of the F-16 fighter jets sent from Nato allies to Ukraine has been destroyed, a Ukrainian military source has told the BBC.

The aircraft went down amid a barrage of Russian missiles on Monday, killing pilot Oleksiy Mes, Ukraine's military said. It marks the first loss of its kind since the planes were delivered earlier this month.

The cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy missile strike, the Ukrainian military claims.

It said the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one drone in Russia's largest aerial attack to date.

*   [Ukraine receives first F-16 fighter jets](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ng1p72wlwo)
    

"Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles," the Ukrainian Air Force wrote in a statement on social media.

"Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life."

The statement did not specify the type of plane involved, but a military source told the BBC the pilot was flying an F-16.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially confirmed on Tuesday the US-made F-16s were being deployed to shoot down Russian drones and missiles.

This week, he asked allies to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to hit targets further into Russia.

Dutch Chief of Defence Gen Onno Eichelsheim confirmed the Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 24 of the jets, in addition to more weapons.

There will be no restrictions on their usage apart from complying with humanitarian law, he told a conference in Washington on Wednesday - meaning Kyiv could launch deeper strikes into Russian territory.

Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023.

Ukraine's F-16s work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground.

They also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States.

The destruction of the aircraft is a blow to President Zelensky, who said he will deliver a ["victory plan"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrlnl2vqe2o)
 to US President Joe Biden next month.

He also revealed Ukraine had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile, but declined to share any more details.

Newsweek AI is in beta. A Ukrainian Air Force F-16 jet enters attack range in the direction of occupied by Russian army Kurakhove on February 17, 2025 in Dnipropetrovsk Region, Ukraine. The pilot took the plane away from the settlement and successfully ejected.

"Thanks to the prompt work of the search and rescue team, the pilot was quickly found and evacuated.

"The pilot's health is satisfactory, he is in a safe place, life and health are not threatened."

Officials are investigating what happened.

The first set of F-16 deliveries from European allies arrived in Ukraine in July 2024, and it was hoped they would help to shift the balance in Russia's war.

The U.S.-made F-16 jets are more advanced than the Soviet-era aircraft Ukraine's forces had been using before.

Ukraine's Previous F-16 Losses
------------------------------

In April, the Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Viper jet [was killed during a combat mission](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-2058982)
. He was named as 26-year-old Pavlo Ivanov.

Ukraine's air force did not reveal the location or many details about the incident in its statement on Telegram, which started with "unfortunately, sad news."

It said Ivanov had died in battle "defending his native land from the occupiers."

The statement said Ukraine's F-16 pilots perform near daily combat missions "in incredibly difficult conditions," providing cover for aviation strike groups and striking enemy targets.

It also said that pilots are working to the maximum of human and technical capabilities, risking their lives each time.

The August before saw Ukraine's first F-16 loss when pilot Oleksii "Moonfish" Mes was [killed while responding to a Russian missile attack](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-russia-f-16-crash-pilot-death-1946329)
. Inconsistencies may occur.

Ukraine has lost another F-16 after an emergency forced the pilot to eject during a mission to repel a Russian attack, said the Ukrainian Air Force in a post on Telegram.

Pilot Ejected During F-16 Emergency
-----------------------------------

The air force post said communication was lost with the aircraft at around 3:30 a.m. 

"Oleksii destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack drone while repelling a massive Russian combined air and missile attack," Ukraine's Western Air Command said at the time.

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

----------- Zhou said that “it is impossible for Beijing to stand by idly” in the face of deteriorating relations between Russia and the US, but that there was space to strengthen the policies governing the control of nuclear weapons stockpiles.

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

US shifts nuclear focus to counter China’s growing arsenal
==========================================================

[Amrita Jash](/the-interpreter/contributors/articles/amrita-jash)

Beijing’s nuclear modernisation means its intentions and commitments to non-proliferation will continue to be questioned.

Listen to this article

[_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.WlFr.MEPeOr7CqMnA&smid=url-share)
 has reported that in March, US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States. The paper goes on to say that for the first time, America’s deterrent strategy has reoriented to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, as it also seeks to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.

This shift in Washington’s policy comes after a Pentagon assessment that over the next decade China’s nuclear arsenal stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of those in the United States and Russia. It has been accused of transferring nuclear and missile technology to proliferators such as Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran, leading the Biden administration to [impose stricter export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-tightens-export-controls-nuclear-power-items-china-2023-08-18/)
 on nuclear materials and technology to China.

These developments underscore that as China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come. The Russia-Ukraine war has only reinforced this idea.

This modernisation also puts a spotlight on China’s commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation norms.

Without economic incentives or offering entree to the White House, South Korea could find itself sidelined in North Korea diplomacy. In its [Annual Report to Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
 last year, the US Department of Defence highlighted two key aspects of China’s nuclear capabilities: First, that China has more than 500 active nuclear weapons, exceeding earlier estimates of 400 warheads, and following [earlier assessments](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-Military-AndSecurity-Developments-Involving-The-Peoples-Republic-Of-China.pdf)
 is expected to have a stockpile of about 1,500 warheads by 2035; and second, that in keeping with its modernisation objectives, China is expected to have more than 1,000 operable nuclear weapons by 2030, many of which will probably be “deployed at higher readiness levels”.

A White House spokesperson was careful to say the new plan was “not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat” and that the guidance provided, while secret, was in keeping with actions taken by earlier administrations.

Beijing, however, raised “grave concerns” over the reported plan, with [China’s Foreign Ministry](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202408/t20240821_11477550.html)
 declaring “the US has called China a ‘nuclear threat’ and used it as a convenient pretext to shirk its obligation of nuclear disarmament, expand its own nuclear arsenal, and seek absolute strategic predominance.”

China has restated its “no first use” policy, saying it has “no intention to engage in any form of arms race with other countries”, while accusing the United States of being “the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world”. Beijing said Washington would be better to make “drastic and substantive cuts to its nuclear arsenal”, and to stop “nuclear sharing” and other “negative moves that undermine global and regional peace and stability”.

As China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come.

Of the nine nuclear-armed powers, China has one of the fastest-growing nuclear arsenals at present. So, to state that China seeks to have parity with the United States or Russia cannot be blithely dismissed. Any increase in China’s nuclear stockpile raises serious concerns, given the opaque nature of the country’s nuclear capabilities and its modernisation ambitions. China’s intentions continue to be guided by Deng Xiaoping’s observations that nuclear force enhancements were necessary “[to earn more say and a higher international status in a coming world order](https://www.academia.edu/23440377/The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments_The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments)

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. Since then, Iran has [progressed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explainer-how-close-is-iran-having-nuclear-weapons-2024-04-18/#:~:text=That%20means%20Iran's%20so%2Dcalled,matter%20of%20weeks%20or%20days.)
 steadily closer to a nuclear weapon, much closer than it would have had the deal remained in place.

Coming in a close second in terms of consequential nuclear decision-making was Trump’s policy toward North Korea. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. He [threatened](http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1708/09/nday.01.html)
 that North Korea would be “met with fire, fury, and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before,” which most observers took to be a thinly veiled nuclear threat. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a military parade in Poland on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations, which began on August 14. The image search results show that tanks were part of the parade.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state the purpose of the parade was to prepare for war with Russia. The parade is described as an expression of strength and a celebration of Armed Forces Day.
