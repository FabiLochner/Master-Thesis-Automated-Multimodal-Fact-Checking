Content: The article from Gwara Media, published on March 28, 2025, debunks a fake Hull Daily Mail cover that claimed 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers died in the Kursk region. <image:7368> The fake cover, dated March 13, 2025, was spread on Telegram and other pro-Russian sources. <image:7373> The actual Hull Daily Mail issue from March 13, 2025, had a different headline.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/): 
Content: The Journal published on March 26, 2025, debunks a fake Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain". <image:7438>. The article states that the image was widely shared on social media and that the Hull Daily Mail's parent company confirmed the headline was fake. The real front page from that date had a different headline. The author is Cormac Fitzgerald.

The claim '<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image of the Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, with the headline about Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region is fabricated, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [Gwara Media](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/) and [The Journal](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/). The actual front page had a different headline.

So, the overall veracity is: false
