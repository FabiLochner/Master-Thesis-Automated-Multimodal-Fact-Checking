## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Penrith City Library lists the Hull Daily Mail from Thursday, March 13, 2025, as a search result. The website mythdetector.com states that the Hull Daily Mail cover with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain" is falsified (![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg)). The actual March 13, 2025, issue does not mention Ukraine.

Magzter also shows the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025 (![image 73](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501202-576951.jpg)). The front page of the newspaper shows the headline "BOY FOUND GUILTY OF ATTEMPTING TO MURDER GIRL WITH A SWORD".


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources debunk a fake Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, which claimed that 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers died in the Kursk region. The image was widely shared on social media. The actual Hull Daily Mail issue from that date had a different headline.

The articles from [Gwara Media](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/) and [The Journal](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/) confirm the front page was fake. ![image 7368](media/2025-08-30_07-41-1756539691-408914.jpg) ![image 7373](media/2025-08-30_07-41-1756539703-190400.jpg) ![image 7438](media/2025-08-30_07-44-1756539876-623799.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the Hull Daily Mail front page with the headline about Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region is fabricated. The actual front page from March 13, 2025, featured a different headline.
