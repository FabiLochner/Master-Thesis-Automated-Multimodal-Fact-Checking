Content: "6, 2024.

“BlackRock purchased 47% of Ukraine’s arable lands … BlackRock has asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers and look for other ways to take care of them because it wants to use the lands in a different way,” reads the claim in part.

Zhao cited a Bulgarian politician named Plamen Paskov whose claim about BlackRock's land ownership in Ukraine was previously [shared](https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20240802/1060759436.html)
 by Russia's state-run Sputnik news agency.

The same claim was shared on other Chinese websites as seen [here](https://user.guancha.cn/main/content?id=1280544)
, [here](https://open.163.com/newview/movie/free?pid=TJ80F8TIC&mid=HJ80F8TIS)
 and [here](https://www.ixigua.com/7399970946571371020)
.

‘In an article published in early August, Russian and Chinese media quoted a purported Bulgarian politician as saying that U.S. The New York-based multinational asset manager has a big enough stake in many influential companies worldwide to push them to change decisions and priorities.

According to a Ukrainian government [press release](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-obgovoriv-z-generalnim-direktorom-blackrock-koordi-80105)
, President Volodymyr Zelensky met BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss how Ukraine could raise national reconstruction funds at the end of 2022.

In May 2023, the Ukrainian government [signed](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-proviv-zustrich-iz-kerivnictvom-najbilshoyi-u-svit-82725)
 an agreement with BlackRock to provide support services to the Ukraine Development Fund in order to attract funds to rebuild the economy after the war ends.

But the claim about BlackRock’s land ownership in Ukraine and its request to the government regarding deceased soldiers is false.

Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are [prohibited](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC043459/)
 from purchasing arable land.

“Agricultural land cannot be transferred (allotted) to foreigners, stateless persons, foreign legal entities and foreign states,” reads the Article 22 of Ukraine’s Land Code (No. 2768-III of 2001).

Keyword searches found a similar claim has circulated since 2023, which has been [debunked](https://mythdetector.ge/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)
 by other fact-checking organizations, including Myth Detector based in Georgia.

Dafina Kandova, a journalist with the Bulgarian checking organization factcheck.bg, told AFCL that her organization had [checked](https://factcheck.bg/ne-e-vyarno-che-amerikanskata-kompaniya-blackrock-zabranyava-na-ukrajna-da-pogrebva-ubitite-si-vojnici-si-v-grobishta/)

 similar rumors circulating in Bulgaria at the end of 2023.

Dafina added that while Plamen Paskov often appears as a commentator for the Bulgarian nationalist Ataka party, he is not actually an official member of the party and has not been elected to public office.

Paskov’s popularity is largely built on social media, gaining followers by spreading conspiracy theories related to hot topics such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, she added. [Skip to main content](#main)

 [! The accompanying photo features Larry Fink alongside the following quote:

> “The owner of Ukraine addressed Ukrainians with a complaint: “There are too many cemeteries! The organization reports that no reputable international media sources contain a quote from the BlackRock Director with identical or similar content. Additionally, the quote is absent from the company’s official [website](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate)
. The widely circulated quote is yet another effort to fuel conspiracy theories about BlackRock and tarnish its CEO’s reputation.

The screenshot shared by Nona Sharabidze originates from an anonymous Russian-language TikTok [account](https://www.tiktok.com/@rinras1/photo/7392652455017778464)

[![Русскій фейк, іді на***!](https://disinfo.detector.media/images/client/podcast_en.jpg?v1.0)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%B9-%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BA-%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%96-%D0%BD%D0%B0/id1613169454)

Propagandists are spreading information on social networks that 47% of Ukraine's territory belongs to BlackRock, and that company representatives came to Kyiv and asked not to bury the dead soldiers on their lands. The author of the post claims that the CEO of BlackRock allegedly advised Ukraine not to pollute arable land with the bodies of dead soldiers and to use crematoriums. They found that the claim that BlackRock banned Ukraine from burying its military is wrong. According to the press service of the President of Ukraine, in late 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyi held a remote meeting with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, during which they discussed possible projects to help structure funds for the country's recovery. In addition, about 70% of Ukraine's territory is agricultural land. Successful partnerships between Ukraine and international companies, such as BlackRock, could become a tool for post-war reconstruction. By spreading such fakes, propagandists try to demoralize the population of Ukraine, creating the impression that even burying fallen defenders could become a problem due to the loss of control over national lands. In 2023, the Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund designed to attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment to restore the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military. The largest companies controlled only 16% of agricultural land, or about 6.45 million hectares. There are more than 10 foreign agricultural companies operating in the country, owning about 3-4 million hectares of land."

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

* * * But this is how five Ukrainian soldiers described to us what had happened.

Volodymyr: 'Drones around the clock'
------------------------------------

On 9 March, "Volodymyr" sent a Telegram post to the BBC saying he was still in Sudzha, where there was "panic and collapse of the front".

Ukrainian troops "are trying to leave - columns of troops and equipment. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

--------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c4g7473l2lgo)

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:5585>!Map showing the region of Sudzha in August 2024, controlled by Ukraine and on 16 March 2025, under Russian control <image:5588>

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. There is no point in keeping it any more".

Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops.

A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. Some gave accounts of a "collapse" as Ukraine lost Sudzha, the largest town it held.

Ukrainian restrictions on travel to the front have meant it is not possible to get a full picture of the situation. It is impossible to leave during the day."

Movement of men, logistics and equipment had been reliant on one major route between Sudzha and Ukraine's Sumy region.

A costly gamble Meduza analyzes Russia’s Kursk counteroffensive and what losing Sudzha means for Ukraine
========================================================================================================

![Russian servicemen in the Kursk region with a captured M777 howitzer. Meduza analyzes how Russia’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region unfolded and what losing its foothold in Sudzha means for Ukraine.

### What happened during Russia’s rapid advance in the Kursk region?

On March 8, Russian forces launched a new phase of their offensive to take back Ukraine’s foothold in the Kursk region. President Donald Trump’s [statement](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114161039436456514)

### Why did Ukraine launch the Kursk operation, and what did it achieve?

How Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region unfolded — and how Russia’s counteroffensive developed

Meduza

As early as 2022, an unusual situation had taken shape along the front line — it was distinctly divided into two sections of nearly equal length:

*   **An active front**, stretching from the northeastern Kharkiv region to the mouth of the Dnipro River, where most forces were concentrated and both sides traded offensives and strikes
*   **A passive front**, running from the junction of Ukraine’s borders with Belarus and Poland to Kharkiv, following the Belarusian-Ukrainian and Russian-Ukrainian borders

Both sides conducted cross-border raids — Russia [using](https://t.me/dva_majors/35315)
 GRU special forces, while Ukraine deployed larger units under the Main Intelligence Directorate. The main rationale became President Volodymyr Zelensky’s publicly stated goal of exchanging Russian-held territory in Kursk region for parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky had repeatedly [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 the goal was to use occupied territory as leverage for a future exchange, but now Kyiv has nothing left to trade. For seven months, Ukraine’s presence in the region tied down a large Russian force, but Kyiv also committed some of its most battle-ready brigades to Sudzha — troops that might have been used more effectively had they withdrawn as soon as Russia launched its counteroffensive in the fall. Another supply route south of Sudzha was also severed by Russian forces.

On the first day of the renewed offensive, Russian units struck north of Sudzha, effectively isolating the entire northern part of the bridgehead from the city. It was there, between the Sudzha–Kursk and Sudzha–Lgov roads, that Russian forward units emerged from a [gas pipeline](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/10/russian-troops-reportedly-spent-days-crawling-through-gas-pipeline-to-slip-behind-ukrainian-lines-in-kursk-region)

At the same time, Russian forces launched an offensive on Sudzha’s eastern districts."

CNN  — 

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/world/ukraine-zelensky-confirms-russian-incursion-intl/index.html)
 said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Sudzha, over a week after his forces launched a [cross-border incursion](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/europe/ukraine-putin-embarrasses-surprise-assault-analysis-intl/index.html)
 into Russia’s Kursk region.

Kyiv’s forces have been in the town, located 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk, since last Wednesday, but this is the first confirmation from the Ukrainian president that his army had captured it.

Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops have advanced 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 1,150 square kilometers of territory and 82 settlements.

Syrskyi said a military commandant’s office has been set up in Sudzha “to maintain law and order and meet the priority needs of the population in the controlled territories.”

Sudzha is located next to a Russian gas terminal, a key point for supplying gas from Russia, via Ukraine, to Europe. A source in Ukraine’s security service told CNN the attack targeted four bases in the southwest regions of Kursk and Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow.

Russia’s defense ministry said it destroyed 117 “aircraft-type” drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk and neighboring regions.

Ukraine’s assault – which poses [a major embarrassment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/ukraine-incursion-russia-analysis-intl/index.html)
 for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.

Russia has pulled reserves from key battleground areas in Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea to repel Kyiv’s advances, a Ukrainian military commander told CNN Wednesday.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in an update posted on Telegram Thursday to have recaptured the first village from Ukrainian forces in Kursk region – the settlement of Krupets.

Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed on Monday to “kick the enemy out” of Russia after it emerged that dozens of Russian villages were under Ukrainian control.

Ukraine meanwhile continues its struggle along the eastern front, where Russian forces have been making incremental gains for months."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region, including the town of Sudzha, which was held by Ukraine and later retaken by Russia. The article includes images of a damaged Lenin statue in Sudzha <image:5594> and a map showing the region of Sudzha in August 2024 under Ukrainian control and on March 16, 2025, under Russian control <image:5588>. Meduza published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing the Russian counteroffensive in the Kursk region and the loss of Sudzha by Ukraine. The article also refers to President Volodymyr Zelensky's goal of exchanging Russian-held territory in the Kursk region for parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia. The article includes images of Russian servicemen <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>.

CNN reported on August 15, 2024, that Ukrainian forces had taken control of the Russian town of Sudzha, located in the Kursk region <image:1>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results include images of Volodymyr Zelensky. One image was published by Axios ([https://www.axios.com/2022/11/14/zelensky-visits-kherson-ukraine](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/14/zelensky-visits-kherson-ukraine)).

The BBC News website also contains an image of Zelensky ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)).

The images show Zelensky in different settings, including meeting with soldiers. <image:7427>, <image:7428>, <image:7429>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. CNN reported that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region on August 15, 2024. The image search results show Zelensky in military settings. However, the evidence does not confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha in August 2024 or met with representatives there.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to a lack of evidence confirming Zelensky's presence in Sudzha and his interaction with local representatives.

This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelensky Sudzha Kursk Offensive")
image_search("Volodymyr Zelensky military visit")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region, including the town of Sudzha, which was held by Ukraine and later retaken by Russia. The article includes images of a damaged Lenin statue in Sudzha <image:5594> and a map showing the region of Sudzha in August 2024 under Ukrainian control and on March 16, 2025, under Russian control <image:5588>. Meduza published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing the Russian counteroffensive in the Kursk region and the loss of Sudzha by Ukraine. The article also refers to President Volodymyr Zelensky's goal of exchanging Russian-held territory in the Kursk region for parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia. The article includes images of Russian servicemen <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>.

CNN reported on August 15, 2024, that Ukrainian forces had taken control of the Russian town of Sudzha, located in the Kursk region <image:1>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results include images of Volodymyr Zelensky. One image was published by Axios ([https://www.axios.com/2022/11/14/zelensky-visits-kherson-ukraine](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/14/zelensky-visits-kherson-ukraine)). Another image was published by The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-izium.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-izium.html)). The BBC News website also contains an image of Zelensky ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)).

The images show Zelensky in different settings, including meeting with soldiers. <image:7427>, <image:7428>, <image:7429>


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. CNN reported that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region on August 15, 2024. The image search results show Zelensky in military settings. However, the evidence does not confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha in August 2024 or met with representatives there.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to a lack of evidence confirming Zelensky's presence in Sudzha and his interaction with local representatives.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:7>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 1.0, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0, 'Bermuda': 0.0, 'Bhutan': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests the image was most likely taken in Ukraine. This aligns with the context of the image, which shows Zelensky in a military setting. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific location within Ukraine, nor does it confirm the claim that the image was taken in Sudzha, Russia.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Ukrainian forces did control Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024. The image search confirms that Zelensky has been in military settings. However, there is no evidence to confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha or met with representatives there. The geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in Ukraine, but not necessarily in Sudzha.

The claim is unverified. While Ukrainian forces controlled Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and Zelensky has been photographed in military settings, there is no evidence to confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha or met with representatives there. The geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in Ukraine, but not necessarily in Sudzha.

This article is part of: [World Economic Forum Annual Meeting](https://www.weforum.org/meetings/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2024/)

*   Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with leaders at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, which takes place from 15–19 January in Davos, Switzerland.
*   In his special address and during a closed-door session, he called on business leaders to invest in Ukraine: “Because people need jobs.”
*   Amid the challenge of war, the country has been undertaking a host of business-friendly reforms and saw GDP grow by more than 5% in 2023.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, there was an expectation that the country would quickly capitulate that was [echoed by many analysts](https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-surprises-russia-putins-months-long-devastating-war-ukraine-2022-12?r=US&IR=T)
.

As Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, reminded participants at the 2024 Annual Meeting in Davos, that is not how things played out. ![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addresses participants at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024.](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/ID94BLyjYVb6YAygjEt_oWBYdsCbftJhLHvS9wOl1OA.jpg)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addresses participants at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024. “Nearly two years since the start of the war, Ukraine still stands,” he said in the opening remarks before a [special address from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2024/sessions/special-address-by-volodymyr-zelenskyy-president-of-ukraine-dbc17a3984/)

That’s largely, Schwab pointed out, because of the country’s resilience in the face of aggression. “Business investment is so necessary,” Zelenskyy said in a closed-door session that brought together over 70 global CEOs from among the Forum’s partner companies. And while Ukraine’s economy [fell by almost 30%](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-gdp-fell-291-2022-during-russias-invasion-2023-04-13/#:~:text=KYIV%2C%20April%2013%20(Reuters),Moscow's%20Feb.)
 in 2022, following Russia’s invasion, this past year it grew by over 5%, Zelenskyy told participants in his special address. It’s also because of the [billions it has received in aid from the US](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts)
 and [Europe](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-solidarity-ukraine/)
.

Today, Zelenskyy called for a different kind of investment: from the private sector."

**What was claimed:** A photo shows President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently wearing a suit to meet WEF founder Klaus Schwab because he is his “actual boss”, amid criticism Mr Zelenskyy received for not wearing one to meet President Trump.

**Our verdict:** This photo shows the two men in suits in 2020, before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after which President Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly.

A photo of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the World Economic Forum (WEF) founder, Klaus Schwab, is being shared with claims it shows him wearing a suit for his “actual boss”.

A spokesperson for Mr Zelenskyy’s office [told reporters at Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/photo-suited-zelenskiy-wef-summit-predates-ukraine-war-2025-03-04/#:~:text=A%20spokesperson%20for,the%20spokesperson%20said.)
 that after the invasion began, the president had not worn a suit for meetings, negotiations or official visits to other countries.

Advertisement The post suggests President Zelenskyy recently wore one to meet Mr Schwab, but not Mr Trump.

But this is missing important context. Mr Zelenskyy does not appear to have worn a suit in public since the day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022—he [shared a video](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/725)
 that day in which he wore a suit—but the photo with Mr Schwab predates this.

The photo [circulating online](https://www.facebook.com/SteveLawsonOfficial/posts/pfbid034ZpTJjHyGodjv2q1sqKqvuxxNgBA8MT2yPjFJ1MpryoL5TMDaXKc9MMC7YVTNP1al)
 shows Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Schwab both in suits, and shaking hands in front of a backdrop featuring the WEF logo. Since the Russian invasion, [Mr Zelenskyy](https://openverse.org/image/ca159444-4cbe-4681-b9e5-68c79391bf29?q=zelenskyy+recently&p=7)
 [has been](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Volodymyr_Zelenskyy,_Rados%C5%82aw_Sikorski.jpg)
 [seen](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ukrainian_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_returned_to_the_European_Parliament_on_17_October.jpg)
 [wearing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=zelenskyy+and+starmer&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image)
 more militaristic, dressed-down attire, including sweatshirts that often feature the [Ukrainian trident symbol](https://ukraine.ua/stories/trident-tryzub/)
.

In an [interview with the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001jv9l)
 in February 2023, [Mr Zelenskyy said](https://youtu.be/HSRjeluwkOY?si=Gdh1A8Aq--Kd9G-3&t=554)
 about his decision to stop wearing suits: “It was more comfortable and more understandable for people. And it's very strange when it’s a war and you’re in a suit.”.

In response to a question from a US journalist at the recent meeting in Washington, Mr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1d4r9yvqzpo#:~:text=%22I%20will%20wear%20costume%20after%20this%20war%20will%20finish%2C%22%20Zelensky%20replied.%20(The%20word%20%22suit%22%20can%20be%20translated%20into%20Ukrainian%20as%20%22kostyum%22.))
: “I will wear costume after this war will finish,” (a Ukrainian word for “suit” is “kostyum”).

It’s not exactly clear what the post means about Mr Schwab being Mr Zelenskyy’s “actual boss”, but we could find no evidence to support this. It has been captioned: “The only time Zelensky will wear a suit is when he meets his actual Boss!”

But this is not a recent photo."

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: "This time, they posted a fake about “the Ukrainian Center for Psychological and Information War received \[from USAID\] funds amounting to $140 million monthly.” Our fact-checking department debunked this news.

What happened? 
---------------

On Feb 12, the Telegram channel [Медведь](https://t.me/bear007/62493?single)
 (“Bear,” [archive](https://archive.ph/f2kqp)
), which regularly spreads Russian disinformation, published a post from American Fox News publication, “Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine \[PIWCU\] received $140,000,000 per month from USAID.”

!зображення до посту: Debunking Russian fakes. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:1806>

We’ve checked the [official website](https://www.foxnews.com/)
 of Fox News and figured out that the article is absent from the list of [Aubrie Spady’s publications](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady?msockid=24fc82c6537363ae340d97415261625e)
. 

On Feb 10, the author didn’t publish anything mentioning the Ukrainian psychological and information operation center. The biggest amount of funds went to economic and humanitarian projects and to financing programs for encouraging democracy and protecting human rights, which is confirmed by the reports from the USA (the totals are shown per year).

The reports about funding from USAID to Ukraine in 2024 / Screenshot: foreignassistance.gov

In the end, we checked the information about the operations of centers of information-psychological operations in Ukraine, one of which is mentioned in the post of propagandists. 

The official website of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence notes that information-psychological operations are the [area of responsibility](https://mod.gov.ua/pro-nas/sili-speczialnih-operaczij)
 of the Forces of Special Operations. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:1805>

Analysis
--------

As evidence, Telegram authors added what seems to be an article by Fox News: its author is Aubrie Spady, and the date of the article’s publication is Feb 10, 2025.

His full quote is: "If Ukraine loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO states, then the US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly in the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war."

Did USAID pay for pro-Ukrainian bots and fakes about Russia?
------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Fox News reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center to create pro-Ukrainian bots and fake news about Russia.

A manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article dated February 10, 2025 has circulated on social media —including [X](https://archive.ph/sqt7Z "External link — X")
, [Reddit](https://archive.ph/ibFZR "External link — Reddit")
, [Telegram](https://archive.ph/f2kqp "External link — Telegram")
, and [Facebook](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/jhCqq "External link — Facebook")
. The altered image claims USAID funds Ukraine's "Psychological and Information Warfare Center" at a rate of $140 million per month. A 2024 [report (pages 24–27)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/14/2003647338/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF "External link — report (pages 24–27)")
 by the Special Inspector General to the US Congress, which monitored government activity related to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024, explained Congress appropriated $182.75 billion for Ukraine-related efforts. USAID's share was approximately $39.9 billion, with the bulk allocated to humanitarian aid, governance programs, and public service support.

There was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center."

If USAID were spending $140 million per month (roughly $1.68 billion annually) on a single program, that amount would dwarf the agency's entire budget for operating expenses, inspection, and health programs combined during the same period.

According to [the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://archive.ph/UkbYb "External link — the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense")
, the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). The timestamp in the screenshot matches [a different report](https://archive.ph/XKPDO "External link — a different report")
, indicating that the image was repurposed to spread the false claim.

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 has been a target of pro-Russian propaganda for years, but a fresh wave of accusations and defamation against him and his country is surging online.

This latest disinformation campaign was fueled by a [recent dispute in the Oval Office](/en/trump-zelenskyy-white-house-fight-ukrainian-reactions/a-71795975)
 between Zelenskyy, [US President Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 and Vice-President [JD Vance](/en/jd-vance/t-70177094)
.

"NewsGuard has seen a significant increase in false claims about Ukraine on US social media in recent weeks, particularly since Donald Trump accused Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for US military support," Madeline Roache, managing editor at misinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told DW.

"We've seen an avalanche of different disinformation campaigns, influence campaigns, different means trying to portray President Zelenskyy personally as a bad leader, the person that should resign, the person that made everything wrong and that Ukraine is bad, corrupt and should stop the war. And that Ukraine wants to prolong the war rather than stop it," Roman Osadchuk, an open source and disinformation researcher at the National University of Kyiv, told DW.

Many of these claims [align with pro-Russian propaganda narratives](/en/fact-check-russian-fake-news-targets-ukraines-zelenskyy/a-68346906)
 about the [war in Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
, often depicting Zelenskyy as corrupt and profiting from the conflict. A January 2025 [US Department of State fact sheet](https://archive.ph/FGy87 "External link — US Department of State fact sheet")
 on US military aid to Ukraine stated that SOF received a total of $42 million, which was allocated for training and other services to develop SOF and Ukraine's National Guard, conventional forces, non-commissioned officer corps, and combat medical care since 2014.

Did Ukraine stage war scenes to get more money from the US?
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Ukraine 'soldiers' have resorted to faking combat in order to appear 'war torn' so the slush fund from the US keeps churning money their way!"  [claimed](https://archive.ph/Mhho8 "External link — claimed")
an X user, posting a video showing a woman in combat uniform receiving professional makeup and asking in Ukrainian whether she should tighten her helmet.

The post went viral, garnering 8.1 million views. Instead, it was filmed during the production of the music video for the song "Brothers" by Ukrainian artists Misha Skorpion and Vitsyk. 

The old narrative of Ukraine staging Russia's war has resurfaced in a new claimImage: x/DW

The video, displaying the username "@vitsikkk2", was initially [posted](https://www.tiktok.com/@vitsikkkk2/video/7476000137416871174 "External link — posted")
on the TikTok account of the artist Vitsyk, who is also a paramedic serving in the Ukrainian army. She can be clearly identified in [the music video](https://youtu.be/NwzqTYEpk8Y?si=Uyu1mIpeFu_5vF7R&t=101 "External link — the music video")
, which appeared on YouTube just a week before this article was published.

Similar claims have been common in past Russian propaganda, often accusing Ukraine of faking atrocities. From February 18 to February 24, 2025, NewsGuard identified about 27,600 social media posts and articles mentioning "Zelenskyy" alongside terms like "villa," "yacht," "winery," or "mansion" — a 2,524% increase from the previous six-day period, which saw just 1,050 such mentions.

[DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of the viral claims.

Did Zelenskyy swear at Trump on camera in London? 
--------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Zelensky burning a very big bridge," [claimed](https://archive.ph/F7L06 "External link — claimed")
an X user in a post that garnered 4 million views. The post features a video allegedly showing Zelenskyy swearing at Trump while arriving to meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the day after their argument in the Oval Office."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a claim that a Fox News article reported that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. One source, [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/), debunks this claim, stating that the article was not published by Fox News and that the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center. Another source, [dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118), also fact-checks the claim, stating that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The article also mentions that the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). A Wikipedia article ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine))) provides information about the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine, a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. <image:11>



### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results include a Fox News profile of Aubrie Spady ([https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady)) and a Muck Rack profile of Aubrie Spady ([https://muckrack.com/aubrie-spady](https://muckrack.com/aubrie-spady)).

The search results include images of Aubrie Spady (<image:7456>, <image:7457>).


## Elaboration
The claim is not entirely accurate. While the image appears to be a screenshot of a Fox News article, the evidence suggests it is a manipulated one.

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

----------- A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

, whose range and power he fears would dramatically escalate the conflict and potentially drag Germany into it more directly. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a Nato member,” Zelenskyy said.

The French president Emmanuel Macron caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus on the matter.

“Even if we get invited \[to Nato\], what happens then?"

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the case on Monday (9 December) for a diplomatic settlement to Russia's war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the NATO military alliance.

The remarks at a joint press conference with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz were the latest to signal Kyiv's increasing openness to war negotiations, with Donald Trump preparing to return to the White House on 20 January.

The UNS president-elect, who has said he wants to end the war quickly, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations to end the "madness", after he met Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron for talks in Paris.

Zelenskyy seeks diplomatic end to Russia’s war, floats role for foreign troops
==============================================================================

A handout photo made available by the Presidential Press Service of Ukraine shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (3-L) holding a meeting with Friedrich Merz (3-R), Chairman of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, during their meeting in Kyiv, 9 December 2024. He suggested that some part of troops of a country be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee us security while Ukraine is not in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

"But we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO," he added.

Kyiv, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join NATO, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion once the current hostilities are halted.

"If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had the invitation, and we would not be in NATO, and there will be a pause, then who guarantees us any kind of security?" Zelenskyy asked at the press conference.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon its NATO ambitions and sees Kyiv's membership of the alliance as an unacceptable security threat.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping to call outgoing US President Joe Biden in the coming days to discuss NATO membership.

"He is the current president and a lot rides on his opinion. <image:4688>Euractiv is part of the Trust Project](/about-euractiv/#About%20the%20Trust%20Project)

December meeting with allies
----------------------------

Zelenskyy's spokesperson Serhiy Nikiforov said later that Kyiv was preparing a December meeting of key European partners who together with the US were "capable of ensuring the maximum strengthening of our state".

The aim was to develop a joint position that would hold strong both in negotiations and on the battlefield, he added.

Zelenskyy said he had discussed a "freezing" of the lines in the war when he met Macron and Trump. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," Zelenskyy said.

[Euractiv.com with Reuters](https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractiv-com-with-reuters/) Dec 10, 2024 06:45 4 min. Russia controls nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory after launching the 2022 invasion that unleashed the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Zelenskyy said he told the two leaders that he did not believe Putin actually wanted to end the war and that the Russian president had to be forced to make peace.

"You can only exert force if Ukraine is strong. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield," he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

He received a rhetorical boost from Merz, the frontrunner in the election race to become Germany's next chancellor, who used his visit to liken Berlin's current policy to making Ukraine fight with one arm tied behind its back.

Foreign troops
--------------

Zelenskyy also returned to an idea raised in February by Macron, who floated the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine. There was no consensus on the matter among the European leaders.

French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated on Tuesday (5 March) that all options should be on the table in fighting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, warning, however, that being too transparent on the EU's next steps could hinder hopes for Ukraine’s victory.

"We can think and work on Emmanuel's position."

Zelenskyy says he is open to negotiated end to war with Russia
==============================================================

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with Friedrich Merz, chairman of the German Christian Democratic Party, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Dec. We do seek it," the Ukrainian president said Monday at a joint press conference in Kyiv with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz.

Zelenskyy also said he is open to the possibility of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine to help his country end its war with Russia, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly three years.

"But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

On his Telegram channel, the Ukrainian leader said the deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a step forward for the Eastern European country’s quest to join NATO.

Zelenskyy’s openness to a negotiated end to the conflict with Russia and the presence of Western troops in Ukraine coincides with Russia’s recent gains in Ukraine and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. 9, 2024. President-elect Donald Trump.

Trump met with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he plans to call U.S. President Joe Biden soon about Ukraine joining NATO.

"He is the current president, and a lot rides on his opinion. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today — while he is not yet in the White House,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump has said he wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly and has called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

However, Zelenskyy told the _New York Post_ that while Trump wants a ceasefire, the two leaders have not discussed any details about that arrangement.

Merz, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's challenger in the upcoming German election, said at the joint address with Zelenskyy that the “basic consensus” in Germany is that Germany will continue to supply Ukraine with military aid.

In his meetings with Zelenskyy, Merz did, however, note that Germany’s position on Ukraine differs from the stance that France, the U.S. <image:4700>

​​​​​​​**LONDON**

The Italian Prime Minister said Tuesday she understands the US approval of the use of long-range missiles for Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice, according to Italian news agency, ANSA.

Giorgia Meloni told reporters at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that the US decision was a "response" to Russia's war against Ukraine.

She said, however, that Italy pledges "support" for Ukraine as long as there is a war there.

US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response that the use of Western missiles by Ukraine may be considered an attack by a non-nuclear state with nuclear support, potentially justifying Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

Moscow has revised its nuclear doctrine, reducing the barriers to deploying nuclear weapons in a conflict. 

"We have always been focused on the issue of anti-aircraft defense," said Meloni. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Giorgia Meloni did not condemn the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Instead, she stated that she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice. The G20 summit's declaration called for peace without naming Russia.

The evidence suggests that Meloni's stance was nuanced, acknowledging the US decision while Italy maintained a different approach.

Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:439>

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

! Zelensky also expressed his hope that Mexico, under Sheinbaum’s leadership, would clearly distance itself from Russia.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. He expressed disappointment over Mexico's inclusion of Russian military personnel in its Independence Day parade and called for recognition of Ukraine’s struggle for independence. "Our Constitution is very clear, noble, and pacifist," she said.

Throughout his tenure, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) maintained a balanced stance on the Ukraine conflict, condemning Russia’s invasion while criticising the US for sending arms to Ukraine. Mexico has also refused to impose sanctions on Russia and declined to send military aid to Ukraine, despite requests from Ukrainian officials.

Nevertheless, it has played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Kyiv after taking office on 1 October, Fuser News reports.

Sheinbaum [stated](https://fusernews.com/nuestra-responsabilidad-es-aqui-sheinbaum-rechaza-invitacion-a-ucrania/)
 her intention to maintain a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, continuing the approach of her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine and adheres to a policy of neutrality regarding the war. Ukraine and the EU have pressured Mexico over its approach to Russia, especially after inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin to the upcoming presidential inauguration despite his ICC arrest warrant.

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico has [called](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/08/08/ukraine-calls-on-mexico-to-arrest-putin-during-mexican-presidents-inauguration/?swcfpc=1)
 on local authorities to detain Putin if he visits, as Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. On 8 August, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said that the European Union had also urged Mexico to arrest Putin if he arrives in the country.

Mexico has rejected a request from Ukraine to arrest the Russian President if he attends the inauguration of Mexico’s next president on 1 October.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of abducting and forcibly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Since then, the Russian leader has avoided traveling to countries that have signed the Rome Statute due to the threat of arrest.

She added that Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with all countries except Ecuador, where an embassy attack in April was deemed a “violation of sovereignty.”

In August, Russian media reported that Mexico had invited Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration on October 1, 2024.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico has urged Mexican authorities to arrest Putin if he visits, citing his war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court, which Mexico recognizes.

López Obrador had previously rejected Ukraine’s request to arrest Putin.

Content: "The demand for drugs and the “war” against it fuels much of the violence and instability in Mexico.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [pointed that out last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-president-tells-trump-tariffs-will-worsen-inflation-kill-jobs-2024-11-26/)
 in response to Trump’s claim that he’ll address this country’s fentanyl problem by putting a tariff on Mexican imports. 4, 2024, 6:06 PM EST

By [Julio Ricardo Varela](https://www.msnbc.com/author/julio-ricardo-varela-ncpn297186)
, MSNBC Columnist

Much of President-elect Donald Trump’s rise to power can be linked to [his blaming Mexico for America’s problems](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-tariffs-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-rcna181923)
. We do not consume synthetic drugs,” Sheinbaum said. When he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015, he claimed [Mexico was mostly “sending” criminals](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-6-most-provocative-parts-donald-trumps-2016-announcement-msna619371)
, including drug dealers and rapists, to the U.S., and [he promised to build a wall](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-immigration-mass-deportation-rcna179782)
 to keep migrants out. Now, his threat to [impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-threats-day-one-trade-tariffs-matter-rcna181793)
 is based in part on the idea that Mexico is the cause of the United States’ fentanyl addiction and to blame for a migrant crisis.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless. It riles up the nativism in his MAGA followers and gives them the scapegoat they crave.

But that ignores that the United States is the world’s most lucrative illegal drug market, [estimated at $150 billion yearly](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/08/20.html)
 for the most common drugs, along with an [increasing use of fentanyl](https://time.com/6977717/fentanyl-pills-seized-study/)
. “Unfortunately, what we do have is the people who are being killed by the crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”

Drugs aren’t the only thing that U.S. Mexico also has enforced new visa requirements for those from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and increased expulsions.”

That all happened under then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his successor, Sheinbaum, [told Trump last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-mexico-president-sheinbaum-immigration-rcna182119)
 “that caravans weren’t arriving at the northern border because they are being served in Mexico.” In other words, Mexico continues to be the United States’ real southern border wall. This, despite Sheinbaum’s claim that “Mexico’s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.” That might sound noble, but Mexico has benefited from being a complicit immigration enforcement partner with the U.S. That type of attitude led [to successes in decreasing drug fatalities](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-overdose-opioid-epidemic-rcna182059)
 during the Biden administration."

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum made this statement — “Start with your own country” — during her regular morning press conference Feb. In the cities of the United States, who sells the drugs that have wreaked such tragedy?”

President Sheinbaum knows what she is talking about, especially if one considers who the big winner is in the drug business. The secrets of drug trafficking, from Colombia to Chicago” — states that there are some 20 million drug users in the United States, of which some 6 million are addicts; however, it is dangerous to talk about the subject, so it is avoided, leading to total ignorance and confusion and the easy construction of stereotypes aimed at blaming the scourge exclusively on the producing countries.

Fernández Menéndez and Ronquillo explain that, after the shipments have crossed the border using all kinds of transport and also through tunnels along the entire border area, the drug trafficking networks begin to operate from 14 cities in the south in the states of New Mexico, Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida and Louisiana, where the drugs are smuggled. In the continuation of the controversy and in defense of Mexico’s best interests, three days later Sheinbaum reiterated that the United States must take responsibility for the serious problem of drug trafficking and drug consumption in its country.

The Mexican president explained that drug trafficking arises from the demand for drugs; as long as there is consumption, there will be supply. In this area, she insisted that the United States must also take charge of controlling its own generators of violence and domestic production of psychotropic substances and must make an effort to monitor and intervene in its illegal internal market.

It must also be said Claudia Sheinbaum showed her indomitable will and patriotic feeling in the conversation she had with the U.S. 7, Sheinbaum reported that she told Trump that it was crucial in the fight against drug trafficking that weapons from the U.S. But today, there are several countries and governments that support and defend the dignity and honor of their peoples.

Claudia Sheinbaum, just like the priests Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, just like Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas, is giving continuity to policies to recover decorum and consciousness of Mexican sovereignty initiated in this century by Andrés Manuel López Obrador. government’s use of the “war on drugs” as a pretext for intervention and exposes inconsistencies in Washington’s propaganda. The Mexican president then said: “They have a lot to do in the United States,” and asked, “How does fentanyl or any other drug get there? Already at the end of the 20th century, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated the profit produced by international drug trafficking at close to $500 billion, more than half of which circulated through the U.S."

United States President Donald Trump thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drugs campaign, on which he pledged to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

[Speaking at a Saudi Arabia-backed investment conference in Miami](https://x.com/jenarovillamil/status/1892377901682589986?s=46)
, Trump said he had spoken to Sheinbaum about drugs and she told him that Mexico is not a “consumer nation.”

.

**‘Fentanyl kills’: Mexico’s anti-drug campaign**
-------------------------------------------------

In early January, [Sheinbaum officially presented a 300-million-peso (US $14.8 million) “national” and “permanent” anti-drugs campaign](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-presenta-campana-preventiva-nacional-y-permanente-alejate-de-las-drogas-el-fentanilo-te-mata)
 under the name “Aléjate de las drogas. (CBP Troy Miller/X)

The government of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador [also ran an anti-drugs campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/fruitless-anti-drug-abuse-campaign/)
, and in early 2023 then deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell was [announced as Mexico’s new addiction prevention “czar.”](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lopez-gatell-addiction-czar/)

The current and former anti-drugs campaigns have [faced criticism for a range of reasons](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
, including because of the focus on fentanyl, which — as Sheinbaum has pointed out — is not widely used in Mexico, and because they have allegedly aroused interest in the synthetic opioid among users of other drugs.

“The main drug problem in Mexico is the use of methamphetamines,” [the news website Expansión reported earlier this month](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
.

Health Minister David Kershenobich said last month that was “probably” the case, although he said that fentanyl “is the most significant” drug used in Mexico “in the sense of mortality and the harm it causes.”

Have something to say? President Donald Trump, who said Sheinbaum inspired his new anti-drug campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump-696x464.jpg "sheinbaum-trump")](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump.jpg)

Despite her status as 'the world's leading Trump whisperer,' President Sheinbaum and U.S. We have great family values,'” Trump said.

He noted that Sheinbaum — who he referred to as a “very wonderful woman” — also told him that Mexico spends a lot of money on anti-drug advertising.

“And I said ‘unbelievable.’ That was such a great conversation because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — \[we’re going to say\] that they chew up your brain, they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. … We’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you,” he said.

Trump didn’t say exactly when he spoke to Sheinbaum about Mexico’s anti-drug advertising campaign.

Sheinbaum [said on social media in late November](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-responds-trump-claim-stop-migration-close-border/)
 that she had spoken to Trump about “the campaign we’re carrying out in the country to prevent the use of fentanyl.”

The U.S. Stay away from drugs, choose to be happy,” [says one video advertisement](https://x.com/SSalud_mx/status/1890611998871704013/video/1)
.

On the day the “Stay away from drugs campaign” was officially launched, [Sheinbaum asserted that the use of fentanyl “is not really a problem” in Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-fentanyl/)
.

While [fentanyl is used in Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fentanyl-use-spreads-deeper-into-mexico-worrying-authorities-2024-02-20/)
 and there have been deaths linked to the powerful synthetic opioid here, “there is not a crisis like there is in the United States,” she said.

“… We don’t want \[the overdose crisis\] to reach our country, and that’s why we’re starting this campaign against fentanyl,” Sheinbaum said.

WATCH: Harris meets with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy as Russia makes nuclear warning
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Sep 26, 2024 6:51 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — With American support for Ukraine at a partisan crossroads, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday slammed suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory for the sake of peace with Moscow as “dangerous and unacceptable.”

The Democratic presidential nominee spoke alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as she unleashed the veiled criticism of Republican candidate Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war.

**Watch Harris and Zelenskyy’s remarks in the player above.**

“They are not proposals for peace,” Harris said. “Where Trump goes off course, and where Biden and Harris have a much stronger argument, is that we get to that point not by throwing Ukraine under the bus but by giving them sufficient support so they can block further Russian aggression.”

 [Chris Megerian, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/chris-megerian-associated-press) assistance for Ukraine, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and faulted Zelenskyy for the ongoing bloodshed.

[**WATCH:** Trump suggests Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russian invasion during N.C. He rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on.”

Asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” and “we need peace.”

Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian leader asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.”

The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications, however benign their contents, was a reminder of the tension that’s been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy.

It was a far different impression than Harris delivered on Thursday as she embraced Ukraine’s defense and outlined a broader foreign policy vision rooted in “international order, rules and norms.” Harris rejected calls for the U.S. to walk away from its global role and warned that potential aggressors could be emboldened if Putin emerges victorious.

“The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it’s in our strategic interest,” Harris said.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to present the White House and Congress with his plans for reaching an endgame in the war by improving Ukraine’s chances on the battlefield and its eventual leverage at the negotiating table. has a responsibility to help Ukraine, compared with one third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in July.

Americans are also split on which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the war. [An AP-NORC poll from August](https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP-NORC-August-2024-President-Topline.pdf)
 found that about one-third of Americans said they trusted Harris more, while a similar share said the same about Trump.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy found some bipartisan support as he visited Capitol Hill, where he was greeted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sen. Jim Himes, another Connecticut Democrat and the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Zelenskyy wanted “more, faster.”

“He was politely frustrated,” Himes said, and specifically requested more Patriot missile defenses as Russia escalates strikes on Ukraine’s cities and energy grid before the winter.

Zelenskyy faces a much more tense situation with Trump. However, he said, Trump risks undermining Ukraine by enabling Putin to make more gains on the battlefield.

“Neither Ukraine nor Russia is going to win this war, and the sooner that the parties try to end this, the better,” Kupchan said. He’s pushing to lift restrictions on using long-range Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russian territory.

No movement on this issue was evident during Zelenskyy’s visit."

![18 February 2023, Bavaria, Munich: Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States, attends the Security Conference. They have cruelly separated children from their families.”

Harris’ speech cited evidence of indiscriminate Russian attacks that deliberately targeted civilians, including the [bombing of a maternity hospital](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-evacuations-03-09-intl/index.html)

 and Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/06/politics/russia-ukraine-antony-blinken-cnntv/index.html)
 have said it was their personal opinion that war crimes have taken place and Biden has gone as far as saying that atrocities at the hands of Moscow’s troops [qualify as “genocide.”](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/biden-iowa-genocide/index.html)

Blinken echoed Harris’ remarks Saturday in a statement released by the State Department.

“We reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes,” he said. However, it could provide [international bodies](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/ukraine-special-tribunal-russia-crime-of-aggression/index.html)
 such as the International Criminal Court, which work to hold perpetrators accountable, with evidence to effectively try to prosecute those crimes.

Laying out the evidence

Harris’ announcement Saturday comes days before the one-year anniversary of [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://edition.cnn.com/specials/europe/ukraine)
. Biden [is scheduled to visit Poland](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/biden-poland-trip/index.html)

Harris said Saturday that as a former prosecutor who began “as young lawyer in the court room and later running California’s Department of Justice,” she knew “firsthand the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law.”

In her speech, delivered inside the famed Bayerischer Hof hotel in Munich, Harris laid bare some of what could be used as evidence of Russia’s crimes against humanity. The vice president spoke of the [horrific images out of Bucha](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/bucha-ukraine-russia-war-victims-intl-cmd/index.html)
 that showed men and women shot and left to rot in the streets and reports by the United Nations of a 4-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by a Russian soldier.

“Barbaric and inhumane,” Harris said.

[![Empty cribs at a playhouse in the courtyard of Kherson regional children's home in Kherson, southern Ukraine, Friday, Nov. The Biden administration is seeking another nearly $30 million from Congress to bolster efforts on this issue.

As it was when the US government declared that Russia committed war crimes last March, it remains to be seen whether there will be any accountability for those accused of carrying out the alleged crimes and whether Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/politics/ukraine-strategy-putin-west/index.html)
 himself will be forced to bear any responsibility.

Still Harris vowed Saturday that the US would support the judicial process.

“In the face of these indisputable facts, to all of us here in Munich, let us renew our commitment to accountability. Let us all agree, on behalf of all the victims, known and unknown: Justice must be served.”

‘For as long as it takes’
-------------------------

Harris, in her speech Saturday, pledged that the US would “strongly support” Ukraine “for as long as it takes,” touting the Ukrainian people’s resolve and resilience.

“There will be more dark days in Ukraine. That, he said, “has been the kind of essential cement in the coalition that the president has organized.”

Warnings about China
--------------------

Meanwhile, Harris expressed concern over [China’s continued support of Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/china/china-russia-partnership-one-year-blinken-intl-hnk-mic/index.html)
 since the war in Ukraine began.

“We have also seen nations like North Korea and Iran send weapons in support of Russia’s brutal war."

A [Fox](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox)
 TV station has been accused of labeling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as Russian territory during an Easter broadcast, prompting Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to call for an investigation "if this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement."

Why It Matters
--------------

Moscow has attempted to paint the government in Kyiv as illegitimate, and President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 penned an extensive essay back in 2021 that called Russia and Ukraine "one people."

Moscow has labeled territory annexed from Ukraine as Russian, and suggested these areas fall under the country's nuclear umbrella.

The Kremlin seized control of Crimea, the peninsula to the south of mainland Ukraine, from Kyiv in 2014. Languages: English, Spanish.You can reach Ellie via email at [e.cook@newsweek.com](mailto:e.cook@newsweek.com)

The announcement [was quickly met with skepticism from Kyiv officials](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-easter-truce-russia-ukraine-backlash-2061857)
 and Western analysts.

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

"As of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 said in a statement early on Sunday.

The declared truce came a day after Secretary of State [Marco Rubio](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/marco-rubio)
 said Washington could be evaluating in the next few days whether U.S. Russian state media on Sunday referred to Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region as "Novorossiya."

Kremlin spokesperson, [Dmitry Peskov](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/dmitry-peskov)
, said in October 2022 that these Ukrainian regions were "inalienable parts of the Russian Federation."

What To Know
------------

Ukrainian media widely shared screenshots on Sunday of a Live Now broadcast that had first included a correct reference to an Orthodox service marking Easter at St. We regret and apologize for the mistake."

Easter is the main holiday for Orthodox Christians, although many in Ukraine now mark major holidays like Christmas in line with Western celebrations to distance themselves religious services from Moscow. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. teams would be able to [clinch a ceasefire deal in the next few weeks.](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-ceasefire-marco-rubio-russia-putin-zelensky-steve-witkoff-2061408)

"We're not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made," Rubio said.

Kyiv, under intense pressure from Washington, has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire deal. [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=)

A screenshot from Fox New's live broadcast on April 20 in which it incorrectly labeled Ukraine's capital a "Russian city."

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has called out Fox News for labeling Kyiv a "Russian city" during its news broadcast.

During its coverage of Easter services on April 20, Fox News aired footage of religious services from around the world, including the service Russian President Vladimir Putin [attended in Moscow](https://kyivindependent.com/putin-attends-easter-service-in-moscow-as-fighting-in-ukraine-continues-despite-ceasefire/)
.

Simultaneously, the right-wing news network broadcast live images from Easter religious services in Kyiv, [misidentifying the Ukrainian capital](https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-not-kiev-how-ukrainians-reclaimed-their-capital-and-their-future/)
 as a Russian city. The error reportedly remained on screen for 20 minutes.

"If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on April 20.

Although he didn't mention them by name, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to also criticize Fox News at the end of a statement on April 20 in which he reported multiple Russian ceasefire violations across the front line since an [Easter ceasefire](https://kyivindependent.com/putin-announces-easter-ceasefire-calls-on-ukraine-to-follow/)
 was declared.

"Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely [commit to a full ceasefire](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-proposes-extending-truce-beyond-easter-sunday/)
," Zelensky wrote.

"We thank all the media, podcasters, bloggers, and everyone sharing the truth about what is happening."

From [Source](https://babel.ua/en/news/117299-fox-news-labeled-kyiv-as-a-russian-city-during-broadcast-of-ocu-easter-service-mfa-demands-investigation): 
Content: "On April 20, the American Fox News channel, during a live broadcast of the Easter service of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), which took place in Kyiv, labeled the Ukrainian capital as a Russian city.

The channel [broadcasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDfiTGGPYCk&ab_channel=LiveNOWfromFOX)
 the broadcast on its YouTube channel.

The broadcast of the Orthodox Church of Ukraineʼs service from St. Michaelʼs Golden-Domed Cathedral in Kyiv was conducted in parallel with the broadcast of the service in Moscow, in which Putin and Patriarch Kirill participated.

Initially, the broadcast from Ukraine was subtitled “Easter Service: Kyiv, Ukraine”, but after a brief pause, the caption “Easter Service: Kyiv, Russia” appeared under the video. <image:7504>

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry [responded](https://x.com/SpoxUkraineMFA/status/1913874411913888136)
 to the designation of Kyiv as a Russian city on Fox News.

"If this was a mistake, and not a deliberate political statement, an apology should be made and an investigation should be conducted into who made the mistake," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhyi.

His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time.

By [Alex Seitz-Wald](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alex-seitz-wald-ncpn385646)
 and [Katherine Doyle](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/katherine-doyle-ncpn1304357)

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a trip to the U.S., while former President Donald Trump isn’t, highlighting the growing partisan division over a key foreign policy issue.

Harris is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelenskyy at the White House. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Sept. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”

Zelenskyy had implied that he was going to meet with Trump this week, but Trump's campaign said there had been no formal agreement for a meeting.

Trump has been saying for months, and he has repeated more frequently at rallies this week, that he would immediately end the war in Ukraine — even if it was on terms favorable to Moscow — and he dismissed Zelenskyy as a “great salesman” for securing money for his country who “so badly” wants Democrats to win to keep the money flowing.

“Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,” Trump said Tuesday in Georgia."

====================================================================================

She took aim at those who've floated Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

September 26, 2024, 6:13 PM

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged to continue support to Ukraine as she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his so-called "victory plan" to bring an end to war with Russia.

Harris cast the conflict as a fight for fundamental principles of "freedom and independence."

"We also know that other would-be aggressors around the world are watching to see what happens in Ukraine," Harris said. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable," she added.

Harris also appeared to take a swipe at her political opponents -- former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. 26, 2024, in the vice president's ceremonial office inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex.

After sources said Wednesday Trump was not expected to meet with Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon Zelenskyy had asked to meet and that they would do so Friday morning at Trump Tower.

"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly," Trump said. We need to stop the death and destruction."

Zelenskyy has called Vance "too radical," taking issue with his [statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/12/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan/)
 that a Trump-Vance administration's approach to the war would likely include Ukraine ceding territory to Russia and the current line of demarcation becoming a demilitarized zone. Johnson told reporters he would not be in town, but if he had sat down with Zelenskyy, would have aired grievances about his tour of an American munitions manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania.

Zelenskyy made the case to lawmakers for permission to strike deeper into Russia at military targets using U.S.-supplied weapons. Several senators on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire for Biden to give Zelenskyy authorization to do so.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. NBC News reports that some Republicans viewed Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election. ABC News reports on a meeting between Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It does, however, suggest that his actions were interpreted by some as a form of support.

Insufficient information exists to definitively verify the claim.

The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. NBC News reports that some Republicans viewed Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election. ABC News reports on a meeting between Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It does, however, suggest that his actions were interpreted by some as a form of support.

!US vice president Kamala Harris and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, Washington, September 26, 2024. <image:3366>

US vice president Kamala Harris and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, Washington, September 26, 2024. The key moment, however, was his joint speech with Vice President Kamala Harris, which broke from custom and signalled Zelensky's involvement in the US election campaign.

The Democratic candidate was thus able, in a solemn setting, to reaffirm the political and military support for Ukraine initiated by Biden at the start of the Russian offensive in February 2022. "The US cannot and should not isolate ourselves from the rest of the world," said Harris. "Isolation is not insulation."

According to the vice president, support for Ukraine is not a matter of "charity," but of US "strategic interest." Without quoting Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, Harris noted that "some" in her country "would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality and would require Ukraine to forego security relationships with other nations." She continued, "These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace."

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. NBC News reports that some Republicans viewed Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election. ABC News reports on a meeting between Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It does, however, suggest that his actions were interpreted by some as a form of support.

Insufficient information exists to definitively verify the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy's actions, such as his visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania and a joint speech with Kamala Harris, were perceived by some as involvement in the US election campaign. The joint speech at the White House on September 26, 2024, is explicitly mentioned as a signal of Zelenskyy's involvement. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris.

Insufficient information exists to definitively verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Zelenskyy's actions, including a visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania and a joint speech with Kamala Harris, were interpreted by some as a form of support for Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. Therefore, the claim is not definitively proven.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not definitively proven. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania and gave a joint speech with Kamala Harris, which some interpreted as involvement in the US election campaign, there is no explicit evidence that he campaigned for her.

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive.

“If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election. X is now relying on it too much, and it is ironic that leadership is now complaining that it isn’t working well.”

Musk’s broadside against Zelenskyy comes as the Ukrainian leader and the Trump administration have been [engaged in a war of words](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 over Washington’s efforts to reach a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” after the Ukrainian leader rejected his claims that Kyiv was to blame for the war and raised concerns about being sidelined in Washington’s negotiations with Moscow.

Trump also claimed that Zelenskyy was “very low” in the polls in his country, echoing his earlier claim that the Ukrainian leader had an approval rating of just 4 percent.

In an opinion poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Wednesday, 57 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy, up five points from December.

The Ukrainian leader’s popularity, however, has waned as the war has gone on, dropping from 90 percent in March 2022 to 64 percent in February last year, according to the institute’s polling.

Since taking control of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has been [heavily criticised](/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 for allowing, and in some cases promoting, misinformation on the platform.

An analysis published by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate found that nearly three-quarters of a sample of false or misleading posts about the 2024 US elections did not display accurate notes correcting the record.

“I think there’s a strong chance that X/Twitter becomes a propaganda arm for Musk/Trump – and, in fact, it’s already happening,” Gordon Pennycook, a professor of psychology at Cornell University who studies misinformation, told Al Jazeera.

“I think Musk wants to reform community notes because he doesn’t like being corrected, as is typical for authoritarian oligarchs.”

Musk, one of Trump’s [most powerful allies](/news/2025/2/12/elon-musk-appears-at-white-house-defending-doges-work)
 as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X’s community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

The Tesla CEO, who later on Thursday appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference waving a chainsaw in homage to Argentina’s cost-cutting president Javier Milei, also did not substantiate a claim that widely reported polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology was “Zelensky-controlled” and “not credible.”

Lucas Graves, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches misinformation and disinformation, described Musk’s comments as “extremely concerning”.

“As is often the case with this kind of rhetoric, the accusations are a guide to what we have to look out for from the accuser – a world where private platforms like X can be systematically gamed to favour the political interests and alliances of their owners,” Graves told Al Jazeera.

“A well-designed community notes system can be a useful check on misinformation. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

“In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election,” Musk said, referring to Zelenskyy’s decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion.

“I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this."

*   [U.S. There's also Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot that is owned by Musk's startup xAI and is used on X.

[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-grok-ai-not-a-good-person/)
 published a story in January about the many negative responses Grok provides when users ask if Musk is a good person. [Futurism](https://futurism.com/the-byte/grok-blasts-elon-musk-misinformation)
 published a similarly themed piece in December, with the headline "Elon Musk's Grok AI blasts Elon Musk as huge spreader of misinformation."

Musk calls Grok a "maximally truth-seeking" AI that is also "anti-woke." Earlier this week, xAI introduced its latest AI model, [Grok 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/elon-musk-xai-grok-3-model-release-ai-competition-.html)
, claiming it can outperform offerings from OpenAI and China's DeepSeek based on early testing, which included standardized tests on math, science and coding. 

Musk did admit during the demo that the model isn't perfect.

"We should emphasize that this is kind of a beta, meaning that you should expect some imperfections," Musk said. Under its constitution, Ukraine can't hold elections while it's at war and under martial law.

In his post Thursday, Musk wrote, "It should be utterly obvious that a Zelensky-controlled poll about his OWN approval is not credible!!" However, there are other available sources.

A consortium that's been conducting extensive polling in Ukraine since 2014 found "63% of Ukrainians now approve of Zelensky's performance as president, a notable increase from the previous year," Joe Stafford, the news and media relations lead at the University of Manchester, wrote in a [post](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/trump-is-making-false-claims-about-zelenskys-popularity/)
 Wednesday.

High favorability ratings for Zelenskyy undermine the narrative that Trump and Musk want to tell.

"If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election," Musk wrote, again without evidence. "It's not a paid person with the job of fact checking."

Musk is not immune
------------------

Additionally, while Musk has pitched Community Notes as a way to replace fact checkers, a recent [study](https://files.maldita.es/maldita/uploads/2025/02/maldita_informe_community_notes_2024.pdf)
 by the Spanish fact-checking nonprofit Maldita showed that many X users still rely on information from professionals."

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

Inspector General Robert P. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose. 

An official website of the United States government

Here's how you know

**Official websites use .mil**

A **.mil** website belongs to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization in the United States.

**Secure .mil websites use HTTPS**

A **lock (lock )** or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to the .mil website. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Content: "<image:3835>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Claim%20-%20Fact%20US%20Ukraine%20Support%202.0_0.png)

**US aid to Ukraine does not lack oversight nor has corruption in Ukraine diverted it.**

Claim: _US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine._

Fact: US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability is extensive and growing.

*   Critics point to a recent corruption case in which a small Ukrainian defense enterprise embezzled $40 million from public ammunition procurement funds, **without noting that the Ukrainian government caught the thieves and recovered the money.****\[1\]**
*   Ukraine has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts within its government and defense industrial base enterprises as part of efforts to increase domestic defense production.\[2\]
*   President Zelensky fired the previous defense minister after domestic corruption scandals unrelated to Western assistance emerged, and his replacement, the current minister, is aggressively rooting out corruption.\[3\] The Ukrainian government is also leveraging the robust and expansive Ukrainian NGO community to assist with its anti-corruption efforts.
*   Ukrainian and DoD personnel have been working aggressively to continue to improve monitoring and tracking of US aid, and US DoD officials have stated that there is no evidence that US-provided military assistance to Ukraine has been misappropriated.\[4\]
*   84% of the funds for Ukraine in the current proposed package would go to US companies, the US military, and other allied militaries, not Ukraine, which would get hardware and training from those funds.\[5\]
*   Western-provided weapons are being used as intended.  Mountains of evidence show advanced Western systems being used against Russian forces in Ukraine.\[6\]

**America’s NATO and Asian allies and other European states have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States.**

Claim: _The United States is giving more support to Ukraine than Europe, and Europe hasn’t stepped up._

Fact: America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

*   The EU and its member states have made available $148.5 billion (138 billion euros) - including its recently announced support package of $54 billion (50 billion euros) - to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\[7\]
*   The United Kingdom has pledged $15.1 billion (£12 billion) in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion (£7.1 billion) is for military assistance.\[8\]
*   Canada has committed $1.8 billion (over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022.\[9\] The Canadian military has also has trained approximately 40,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel since 2015, and Canada expanded and extended this program until March 2026.
*   Norway reached a multi-year agreement with Ukraine in February 2023 for a support program that will provide Ukraine with $7 billion (75 billion Norwegian kroner) between 2023 and 2027.\[10\] Norway pledged to allocate to Ukraine around $1.4 billion (15 billion Norwegian kroner) per year and had already provided around one billion dollars (10.7 billion Norwegian kroner) to Ukraine in 2022 and about $1.9 billion (19.9 billion Norwegian kroner) in 2023.
*   NATO member Turkey is building a new drone production facility and service center in Ukraine. Turkey’s leading drone maker, Baykar, announced in September 2023 that Turkey would open a drone production facility and service center for Bayraktar TB2 drones, which reportedly will become operational by early 2025.\[11\]
*   NATO member North Macedonia has sent 10 batches of military aid to Ukraine including Soviet-era military equipment as of November 2023.\[12\] North Macedonia is also training batches of Ukrainian military personnel and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine.\[13\]
*   South Korea is expanding its production of critical 155mm artillery shells to refill Western stockpiles and support the continued provision of ammunition in Ukraine.\[14\]
*   Japan pledged $4.5 billion to Ukraine in December 2023.\[15\] Japan also pledged an additional $37 million contribution to a NATO fund to provide additional support for Ukrainian defense in January 2024.\[16\]
*   Australia provided approximately $590 million (910 million Australian dollars) in overall military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as of late October 2023.\[17\]
*   New Zealand provided Ukraine with more than $48.7 million (80 million New Zealand dollars) in military and humanitarian assistance as of July 2023.\[18\]

**Ukraine is not a “forever war” for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war.**

Claim: _Ukraine is another 'forever war' for the United States._

Fact: This is not an American war.  It’s another nation’s war against an American enemy.

*   Ukrainians are fighting this war, not Americans.
*   The US is helping Ukraine fend off the Russian attack to reduce the risk that the US will have to fight Russia in the future. 
*   A Putin victory over Ukraine would embolden him and encourage him to test America’s willingness to defend its NATO allies, increasing the risk of a US-Russia war.\[19\]
*   Russian victory would also let Russian forces move closer to current NATO borders, forcing the US to commit more troops to the defense of its NATO allies.\[20\]
*   Ukraine is building up its own military and defense industry to be able to reduce its dependence on the US and will be able to do so if the US continues its support.\[21\]
*   Ukraine already has a significant defense industry and was one of the world’s leading weapons suppliers before the Russian invasions and is investing its own money and attracting foreign investors to dramatically increase this capability.\[22\]

**Sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness and reduces the risk that the United States will have to fight Russia itself.**

Claim: _Sending military aid to Ukraine degrades America's military readiness_.

Fact: Sending military aid to Ukraine has enabled the United States to modernize its own military to be better prepared to fight the next war.

*   The US is supporting Ukraine in part so that the US won’t have to fight Russia itself.
*   The overwhelming majority of military assistance is going to build up the US defense industrial base.\[23\]  It is allowing the expansion of current production lines of essential military supplies that the US military will need in any future war.
*   The equipment the US has been giving Ukraine is mostly old and sometimes inoperable.\[24\]  The US is purchasing new systems to replace what it gives Ukraine, modernizing the American military in the process.
*   American allies are also reinvigorating their defense industries and modernizing their militaries as consequences of support to Ukraine, which benefits the US.\[25\]

Content: The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine. The audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies. The audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. The DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The report is from 2025.

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)

).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

It also mentions that the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine in March 2022.

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, September 30, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 130 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding: 57 in North Carolina, 29 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities and media reports compiled by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Widespread havoc
----------------

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday. "And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us. "He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

JD Vance criticised Fema's response to the hurricane at a rally in Butler on Saturday

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On September 30, 2024, Le Monde reported on President Joe Biden's remarks regarding the response to Hurricane Helene, including a visit to North Carolina and the rising death toll (<image:7567>). The BBC published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing Biden's condemnation of disinformation about the government's hurricane response, including images of the hurricane's impact (<image:7570>, <image:7582>, <image:7584>). France 24 reported on October 1, 2024, on Biden's response to Hurricane Helene, including his visit to North Carolina and his remarks to reporters on September 30, 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that President Biden made remarks regarding Hurricane Helene on September 30, 2024, and that he visited North Carolina. However, the provided sources do not mention any announcements about stopping aid for the affected areas or providing additional aid to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Biden made the specific announcements mentioned in the claim.

A Sept. shows President Joe Biden speaking with reporters about Hurricane Helene and those impacted by the storm. Data from the National Hurricane Center shows the current death toll would rank Helene as the [sixth-deadliest](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/30/hurricane-helene-death-toll-high/75445229007/)

 for a supplemental aid bill for those affected by the storm.

"We know there is more to do, and we will continue to surge resources, including food, water, communications and lifesaving equipment," Biden said."

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake. Further in the material about why it is fake.**

**Fake**

As already noted, Russian propaganda actively exploits the topic of mocking Ukraine, Ukrainians and the leadership of the Ukrainian state through fake covers of famous Western publications."

 [! Consequently, the alleged issue date is also falsified, as the satirical magazine did not publish any issue on March 20. It is noteworthy that after this, the fake cover photo, translated into Italian from Solovyov’s post, was actively shared by Italian-speaking users on social media.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine and started a full-scale war on February 24, 2022, the forging of magazine covers to discredit Ukraine or its leaders has become an active part of Russian disinformation campaigns."

The accounts sharing the front cover and commenting on it are critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of demanding money from world governments and using Ukraine's defence against Russia's war as a pretext.

It's a common accusation that critics of Ukraine try to levy against the Ukrainian president in an effort to weaken support for Kyiv.

But this is all false: firstly, we can easily check whether the picture is authentic by visiting [**Charlie Hebdo's website**](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 — it's not anywhere to be found.

It was supposedly published on 23 April 2025, but checking Charlie Hebdo's list of recent publications shows us that the real 23 April edition looks completely different.

!The real 23 April edition alongside the fake one <image:7633>

The edition number is also wrong: the real cover shows the number 1709, while the fake one is labelled 1710.

The real edition does deal with the pope's death, but instead mockingly says his successor will be "truly close to the poor" by depicting him as a rat.

Many of the accounts sharing the fake front cover online are pro-Russian and regular disseminators of Kremlin propaganda that attempt to discredit Ukraine.

Charlie Hebdo itself has previously [**issued a warning**](https://charliehebdo.fr/2022/09/societe/des-russes-font-des-fausses-unes-charlie/)
 that pro-Russian actors are using its image to produce anti-Ukraine content.

"Russian propagandists are creating fake Charlie Hebdo front pages to make it appear that the newspaper supports Putin," the magazine said.

"While the process isn't new — there are plenty of fake Charlie front pages — it's surprising to see it still working," it added.

 of false Charlie Hebdo editions that disparage Zelenskyy. In this one, Zelenskyy was depicted as Quasimodo, a character from Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", again as part of an effort to demean him and wider Ukraine by extension.

It's been widely shown that Russia is attempting to damage support for Ukraine by spreading propaganda that depicts Zelenskyy as a money-grabbing opportunist who's robbing taxpayers' funds.

This particular fake Charlie Hebdo front cover is especially striking because it combines two figures who have constantly fallen victim to deepfakes over the past few years: Zelenskyy and Pope Francis.

The former has become a prime target for misinformation in general ever since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Such false narratives, such as accusing him of prolonging the war and calling his motives for financial assistance into question, are amplified when even high-profile politicians worldwide, such as US President Donald Trump, [**have labelled him a "dictator"**](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/21/fact-check-what-is-the-truth-behind-trumps-claims-on-ukraine)
.

However, Western countries are providing legitimate financial and humanitarian support to Kyiv, and surveys [**consistently show**](https://www.statista.com/chart/34068/public-support-for-ukraine-aid-in-europe/)
 that a strong majority of European citizens back this.

Since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become by far the top recipient of U.S. commitment has been called into question in 2025, with President Donald Trump freezing all military aid to Ukraine in early March, and then lifting the freeze shortly after, following cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia.

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

In late 2024, the United States also provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan, funded by interest generated from frozen Russian assets.

It’s important to note that of the total U.S. activities associated with the war in Ukraine, and a small portion has supported other affected countries in the region.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. aid has gone toward providing weapons systems, training, and intelligence that Ukrainian commanders need to defend against Russia, which has one of the [world’s most powerful militaries](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-do-militaries-russia-and-ukraine-stack "world’s most powerful militaries")
. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defense and counteroffensive against Russia. After some initial restrictions, the Biden administration in November permitted Ukraine’s first use of the ATACMS to strike inside Russian territory.

 

How does the aid to Ukraine compare to that for other recipients of U.S. contribution stands out, particularly in the case of military aid.

However, many European governments are making larger contributions to Ukraine relative to the size of their economies.

Thirty countries made major arms transfers to Ukraine in the first two years of the war. The vast majority of committed aid has been allocated, but much of it has not yet been delivered.

A main aim of this database to quantify the scale of aid to Ukraine and to make the support measures comparable across donor countries. Much of the discussion on aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war has been anecdotal, while a rigorous quantification has been missing. To value these, we draw on a broad range of sources to identify market prices, choosing an upper bound, when possible, e.g., by using the new purchase price even if much of the military equipment is probably used.

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022. *   [Go to main content.](#main "Go to main content.")

A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial and humanitarian support by governments to Ukraine since February 2022. The database is intended to support a facts-based discussion about support to Ukraine. 

We focus on government-to-government transfers into Ukraine. To do so, we set up a comprehensive database that brings together information from official, government sources, existing lists of Ukraine aid, and reports by renowned news media.

An important challenge is to **quantify non-financial transfers**, such as in-kind shipments of military equipment, weapons, medicines or foodstuff. Suggestions are very welcome and can be sent to [ukrainetracker@ifw-kiel.de](#)

 last month.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed thanks for the assistance on social media.

[!President Trump sits with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House. <image:2273>](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/14/nx-s1-5467272/russia-ukraine-war-trump-nato-weapons-tariffs)

"We already have commitments from the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark – over one billion dollars for American weapons that Ukraine will receive. This cooperation with NATO countries will continue," Zelenskyy [wrote on X](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1952738801010303372)
.

He also said he had a "productive conversation" with Trump.

"We coordinated our positions," Zelenskyy wrote. In contrast, Trump has grown sharply critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has intensified his attacks on Ukraine in recent months.

### Air defenses for Ukraine

The Netherlands said it will send American missiles and other components used in the U.S. <image:2274>](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/02/nx-s1-5488809/russia-ukraine-war-ukrainians-return)

The Patriot batteries are Ukraine's most effective means of shooting down incoming Russian missiles. The Ukrainians say they urgently need additional missiles for the Patriot batteries to defend against escalating Russian airstrikes.

Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans [wrote](https://x.com/DefensieMin/status/1952399182993445342)
 on X: "This helps Ukraine to defend itself and the rest of Europe against Russian aggression." The Dutch valued the assistance at more than $500 million.

In addition, Sweden, Norway and Denmark say they've collectively agreed to support a package of U.S. arms they would send to Ukraine.

Trump came into office in January saying he opposed additional U.S. But at a White House meeting in July with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump said he supported NATO countries buying U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, far more than any other country.

While many European countries say they will step up their support, it's far from clear whether increased European assistance will make up for the loss of U.S."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced a possible Foreign Military Sale to Ukraine of Air Delivered Munitions and related equipment for an estimated cost of $825 million, including 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles and 3,350 Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) (<image:i>). Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase. The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration approved the $825 million arms sale to Ukraine, which will be paid for by NATO allies and U.S. foreign military financing.

The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. A large share of the aid has been spent in the United States to produce weapons that are shipped to Ukraine or replenish U.S. stockpiles. Thirty countries made major arms transfers to Ukraine in the first two years of the war.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced a possible Foreign Military Sale to Ukraine of Air Delivered Munitions and related equipment for an estimated cost of $825 million, including 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles and 3,350 Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) (<image:i>). Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase. The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration approved the $825 million arms sale to Ukraine, which will be paid for by NATO allies and U.S. foreign military financing.

The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. A large share of the aid has been spent in the United States to produce weapons that are shipped to Ukraine or replenish U.S. stockpiles. Thirty countries made major arms transfers to Ukraine in the first two years of the war.

Fire Point’s Flamingo missile could have a range of 3,000km, allowing unprecedented range on strikes within Russia - Efrem Lukatsky/The Associated Press

The Ukrainian defence company behind the [Flamingo cruise missile](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/08/18/ukraine-flamingo-missile-3000km-1tonne-warhead/)
, touted as a potential game-changer in the war, is reportedly under investigation for corruption.

Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) is probing whether Fire Point misled the government on the price and delivery of its long-range drones, the Kyiv Independent reported, citing five sources familiar with the investigation.

Little-known until recently, Fire Point surged to prominence with a publicity blitz surrounding its long-range drones, dubbed FP-1, and the forthcoming Flamingo, or FP-5.

It is hoped that the Flamingo will usher in a new phase of the war in which [home-made Ukrainian missiles](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/24/why-trumps-atacms-block-is-no-longer-such-a-blow-to-ukraine/)
 can wreak havoc deep inside Russia’s borders, potentially striking as far as St Petersburg or Vladimir Putin’s holiday residences.

!Officials overseeing the project have been &#39;stunned&#39; by the missiles&#39; capabilities <image:7655>

Earlier this month, Mr Zelensky hailed the Flamingo as “currently our most successful missile”, stating it could enter mass production in February.

The engine-powered missile is said to have a range of 3,000km and carry a 1,000kg warhead, making it capable of much more explosive strikes than the [long-range drones](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/14/ukraine-defence-industry-prepares-long-war/)
 currently battering Russian territory.

But questions have been raised about the accuracy of Fire Point’s claims for its drones.

According to the Kyiv Independent, Nabu is investigating whether the company inflated the value of the components in its FP-1 drones, or the number it delivers to the military, or both.

Emerging almost out of nowhere with executives who lack experience in defence manufacturing, Fire Point gained nearly a third of the contracts for drone manufacturing in 2024, worth $320 million, the Ukrainian website alleged.

With a range of 1,600km, the FP-1 has proven itself on the battlefield. It has [blitzed Russian fuel facilities](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/03/12/ukraine-two-russian-oil-refineries-hit-drones-petrol-crisis/)
 since its introduction in May, causing shortages that have pushed the price of petrol to record highs.

“It’s a pretty good drone system, so at least right now it’s working,” said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile researcher and non-resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.

“But obviously, if they managed to get the initial contracts via corruption, that would be a massive issue.”

Fire Point confirmed the existence of a Nabu investigation to the Kyiv Independent, but said it was the product of rivals’ rumour-mongering and downplayed its significance.

In a statement, Nabu said it was not “conducting an investigation regarding the ‘Flamingo’ missile mentioned in the media.”

The agency did not respond to questions seeking clarification over whether it was probing Fire Point over the FP-1 long-range drone.

Also on Friday, the Economist reported on rumours surrounding Fire Point’s “alleged proximity to the presidential office, non-competitive financing, and even whether the \[Flamingo\] missile is Ukrainian.” Fire Point denied the claims.

The magazine also cited one official overseeing the project who said they were “stunned” by the missile despite having been “very sceptical” at first.

Last week, Fire Point allowed the Associated Press to tour a facility housing the Flamingo, which is named on account of an early batch coming out pink by mistake – and the unusually-high presence of women throughout the manufacturing chain.

Ramping up production
---------------------

Iryna Terekh, the company’s chief technology officer, said it was currently producing one missile per day but hoped to increase that to seven by October.

“I find that extremely optimistic,” Mr Hoffmann said."

Ukraine says it has uncovered major arms corruption

The SBU said defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided

**Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m).**

The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.

It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.

Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.

Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

The SBU said an investigation had "exposed" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, "who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells".

"According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement," it said.

The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, "not a single artillery shell" was ever sent.

One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said.

Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.

Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.

The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.

In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.

Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a [2022 corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022)
 by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.

But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference. It is one of only 10 countries steadily climbing Transparency International's ranking, rising 28 places in a decade.

The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration approved the $825 million arms sale to Ukraine, which will be paid for by NATO allies and U.S. foreign military financing.

The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. A large share of the aid has been spent in the United States to produce weapons that are shipped to Ukraine or replenish U.S. stockpiles. Thirty countries made major arms transfers to Ukraine in the first two years of the war.

Future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict

*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/arms-trafficking/)
    
*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/violence-fragility/)
    

*   [! What this means for organized crime, and specifically the smuggling of weapons and ammunition into Europe is unclear, but by using scenario modelling we can divine insights and provide concrete recommendations.

On 20–21 January 2025, the GI-TOC hosted a conference in Brussels to discuss three potential trajectories of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the ramifications of each on arms trafficking dynamics in Europe.

The conference gamed three scenarios – a peace agreement, a stalemate conflict and a decisive victory for Ukraine or Russia. Some leakage must be expected, and understanding this reality should persuade policymakers to act sooner rather than wait for a trigger event in a European city.

#### Key points

*   Draft, support and implement policy measures that reduce arms trafficking risks in Ukraine, including (when it is formulated) Ukraine’s demobilization law, and its security sector reform and veteran policy.
*   Improve Europe-wide operational capabilities in terms of information sharing, coordination and access to data.
*   The arms trafficking trade is likely to be multifaceted: a small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors.
*   ‘Traditional’ organized crime may be involved in arms trafficking alongside other more lucrative activities, like the drug trade, but ex-military personnel may form a new class of ‘brokers’, using connections with other military and politicians to set up larger-scale operations.
*   Tailor responses that recognize demand is king: the right kit for the right customer. <image:1112>\

Smoke on the horizon: Trends in arms trafficking from the conflict in Ukraine\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)

[! Participants were asked to respond, from the perspective of organized crime, law enforcement and multilateral policymakers, to emergent arms trafficking dynamics, working through various turns to discover second- and third-order implications. Asking participants to step outside their role and think like a criminal is rewarding and illuminates the discussion, while building trust and personal connections.

The purpose of this exercise was to provide policymakers with a forward-looking perspective that would map the potential risk of arms trafficking across a range of situations, point up gaps in responses and develop specific and measurable policy response options for national authorities to implement with the aim of reducing the risks of illicit firearms markets in Europe from the conflict.

Fostering international cooperation and information-sharing was also a primary goal of the conference. More than 60 high-level stakeholders attended from a range of organizations focusing on arms trafficking.

#### Understanding the risk

Understanding of the risks of arms trafficking arising from the conflict has improved since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Yet recent research suggests criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes and supply chains, and the scale of the problem is much larger than past occurrences of large-scale diversion, such as the Balkans and Afghanistan. Experts and policymakers in neighbouring and other European countries continue to express their concerns about the threat of large-scale diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine. An overarching conclusion was that policy responses must flexible and scalable from the start.

**Use lessons learned (and learn new ones)**

The conference highlighted the fact that many policy bodies in Europe have a deep and multilayered understanding of the legacy of the Balkans conflict on arms trafficking trends in Europe."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The report highlights concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets. The report suggests that arms trafficking is likely to be multifaceted, involving both small-scale trade to European organized crime and larger-volume trade to other regions. <image:1112>

! Taking into account the EU recommendations and ensuring the proper functioning of the Coordination Centre, we are making our contribution to the development of the European security architecture,” the Minister added.

In his turn, Ambassador Petr Mareš, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairmanship and Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine, said that the issue of arms trafficking is becoming increasingly acute due to russia’s full-scale invasion, but the creation of the Coordination Centre will help to effectively counteract this problem. Achieving synergy in combating illicit arms trafficking is of great importance to us, as we are aware that the war is ongoing, and only through joint efforts can we ensure security in Ukraine and Europe,” he said.

In response, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stressed that, with the assistance of international partners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is implementing a number of joint projects aimed at building the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies.

Harshet Virk, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Programme Office in Ukraine, stressed that owing to the coordinated and efficient efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, not a single weapon was trafficked to the European Union: “I sincerely congratulate you on the establishment of the Coordination Centre – this is an important step in the fight against crime and illicit arms trafficking. <image:1118>

Harshet Virk noted that her team will continue to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by providing software and organising relevant trainings.

Maura O’Sullivan, the Acting Head of the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, said that the Centre is a reliable solution for monitoring the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the area of combating illicit arms trafficking: “We are ready to continue to support you and facilitate the rapid exchange of information. The main tasks of the Centre are:

– processing and systematisation of information received;

– coordinating the actions of state authorities, institutions and organisations on combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– ensuring the exchange of information between the authorities of Ukraine and partner countries;

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced a possible Foreign Military Sale to Ukraine of Air Delivered Munitions and related equipment for an estimated cost of $825 million, including 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles and 3,350 Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) (<image:i>). Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase. The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration approved the $825 million arms sale to Ukraine, which will be paid for by NATO allies and U.S. foreign military financing.

The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. A large share of the aid has been spent in the United States to produce weapons that are shipped to Ukraine or replenish U.S. stockpiles. Thirty countries made major arms transfers to Ukraine in the first two years of the war.

Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The report highlights concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets. The report suggests that arms trafficking is likely to be multifaceted, involving both small-scale trade to European organized crime and larger-volume trade to other regions. <image:1112>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there are concerns about arms trafficking and corruption related to arms purchases in Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not confirm the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights investigations into corruption and the establishment of centers to combat illicit arms trafficking, but it does not provide any data on the volume of arms sales or the origin of the armaments being sold.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific information about the sale of U.S.-supplied armaments.

The PBS Frontline World article discusses Ukraine's history of illegal arms sales and corruption ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)). The articles do not contain any information about Ukraine selling armaments received from the United States. <image:7653>, <image:7655>, <image:7667>, <image:7672>, <image:7673>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, highlighting concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/)) <image:1112>. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking on February 6, 2025 ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)) <image:1115>, <image:1117>, <image:1118>, <image:1125>, <image:1120>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there are concerns about arms trafficking and corruption related to arms purchases in Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not confirm the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights investigations into corruption and the establishment of centers to combat illicit arms trafficking, but it does not provide any data on the volume of arms sales or the origin of the armaments being sold.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific information about the sale of U.S.-supplied armaments.


## Final Judgement
The search results reveal discussions about arms sales, corruption, and arms trafficking in Ukraine, but they do not provide any evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The available information does not confirm the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While there are reports of corruption and arms trafficking concerns, the provided sources, including those from the [Defense Security Cooperation Agency](https://www.dsca.mil/Press-Media/Major-Arms-Sales/Article-Display/Article/4289280/ukraine-air-delivered-munitions), [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207), and [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine), focus on U.S. aid, arms sales to Ukraine, and tracking military aid, without any data on the alleged sales.

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. The Houthi arsenal of surface-to-air missiles [includes](https://www.csis.org/analysis/missile-war-yemen)
 Russian-made missiles originating from prewar Yemeni army stocks, such as the SA-6/Faster (Innovator) surface-to-air missile and the Thaqib (Piercer) missile family. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. The shootdowns of US drones boost morale for Houthi supporters at a time of great hardship under Western and Israeli air strikes. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders."

Yemen’s Houthi armed group has shot down seven US [Reaper drones](/news/2025/4/22/houthis-say-group-downed-us-drone-in-northwest-yemen-as-us-strikes-continue)
 worth more than $200m in recent weeks, marking the most significant material loss yet in Washington’s campaign against the fighters.

The drones were destroyed between March 31 and April 22, according to defence officials, as the Houthis step up efforts to target United States aircraft operating over Yemen.

Three of the drones were lost in the past week alone, suggesting an improvement in the Houthis’ ability to strike high-altitude US aircraft.

The drones – each costing about $30m – were conducting surveillance or attack missions when they crashed into water or land. This claim could not be independently verified.

Another US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drone losses are under investigation but are likely the result of hostile fire, the AP reported.

The Houthis have targeted mainly Israeli, US and British ships passing through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in protest against Israel’s war on Gaza. A defence official said the strikes occurred on March 31 and on April 3, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 22, according to The Associated Press news agency.

Dozens of civilians have been reported killed in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen since March 15 after US President Donald Trump ordered daily strikes against the group.

Central Command spokesperson Dave Eastburn said on Thursday that US forces have struck more than 800 targets, destroying command centres, weapons depots and air defences, and killing hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders. The group has said the attacks would stop if Israel agreed to a permanent ceasefire.

Mounting civilian death toll
----------------------------

The Trump administration appears to have shifted from targeting only infrastructure to deliberately striking figures within the Houthi movement.

The strategic change comes amid rising civilian casualties from the US-led campaign, [according to Airwars](https://trump-yemen.airwars.org/)
, a UK-based monitoring group.

Airwars estimates that between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in US strikes during March. The group believes the toll in April is already considerably higher, though full figures remain unconfirmed.

Earlier this month, a [US air strike](/news/2025/4/18/more-than-30-killed-80-injured-in-us-air-strikes-on-yemen-report)
 targeted the Ras Isa port, also in Hodeidah, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 150.

This was followed by another attack on Monday, which killed 12 people and wounded more than 30 others in Yemen’s capital Sanaa.

Concerns are growing in Washington over the human cost of the campaign.

Senators Chris Van Hollen, Elizabeth Warren and Tim Kaine have written to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, questioning whether the administration is abandoning its responsibility to reduce civilian harm, particularly after reports emerged about the high civilian death toll on the Ras Isa fuel terminal.

* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:20>)
web_search("US drone shot down Houthi Russian missiles")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the downing of US MQ-9 Reaper drones by the Houthis. According to Wikipedia, a US drone was shot down near Hodeidah on February 20, 2024, as part of US-UK airstrikes on Yemen. The Atlantic Council notes that the Houthis possess Russian-made missiles and have claimed to have downed a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate in 2025. Al Jazeera reports that the Houthi armed group shot down seven US Reaper drones between March 31 and April 22, 2025, in Yemen. <image:20> <image:0>

The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News reports that Houthi rebels claimed to have shot down a US military Reaper drone (<image:7845>). ABC News reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone (<image:7847>).



# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US drones, including MQ-9 Reapers, using Russian-made missiles. The image's geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis.

The image search results show images of downed drones, but they do not match the image in the claim. The claim states the drone was shot down in March 2025, but the evidence does not provide the exact location of the incident.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable due to the lack of information linking the image to a specific drone downing incident by the Houthis.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has F-16 fighter jets. The Politico.eu article mentions a Ukrainian pilot who died in an F-16 crash. However, the evidence does not confirm the cause of the crash or whether it was shot down by Russia.

The image search results do not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows an F-16 shot down by Russia. More information is needed to confirm the cause of the crash and the identity of the aircraft in the image.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

> Oleksiy "Moonfish" Mes perished in the F-16AM s/n 80-3600 (ex-Royal Danish Air Force s/n E-600). The accident occurred on the very first day of combat usage of the F-16 Fighting Falcon by the Ukrainian Air Force. 
  
NASA Sentinel-2 satellite imagery shows a crash site located in the vicinity of Kurhany in Rivne Oblast. It appears that the aircraft crashed into the ground largely in one piece, resulting in one large debris site, albeit with a significant fire spread. 
  
On 26 August, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky espoused the effectiveness of the Western origin F-16s in supposedly repelling a mass Russian strike, but made no mention of any aircraft losses. An official statement released by the General Staff read (translated):  
  
"F-16 fighters of the Ukrainian Air Force were used together with anti-aircraft missile units during repulse of a missile attack by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine."

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. Only a small number of the country’s top pilots have been trained to fly F-16s, the most advanced of Ukraine’s fighter jets. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. We cannot remain bound by conditions when the enemy has no restrictions,” Roman Kostenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, said in a statement.

According to the United Nations, Ukraine is the most heavily mined country in the world. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines."

Content: "As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died.”

!Ukraine receives its first F-16 fighter jets <image:7898>

F-16 Fighting Falcons are seen as President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky delivers a speech congratulating the Ukrainian military on the stand in front of the first General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon received by Ukraine on August 4, 2024 in, Ukraine. A PSU representative, speaking to multiple outlets, later stated, “different versions \[of the crash\] are being considered, including the ‘friendly fire’ of their air defence systems, a technical malfunction and pilot error.” (That doesn’t rule out friendly fire, but stops well short of confirming it; a final answer is likely to only come out following a thorough review.)

One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles.  These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject.

This version is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence, as one of the same industry executives told Breaking Defense that “earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.”

“There were two MiG-29s and two Sukhoi models lost in this way,” he continued. !Funeral Takes Place Of Downed Ukrainian Pilot <image:7895>

The rite of burial of Ukrainian F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes, on the Day of Remembrance for Fallen Heroes, as hundreds attended a farewell ceremony for the deceased tactical aviation pilot in the central square of the city on August 29, 2024 in Shepetivka, in Khmelnytskyi Oblast (province) Ukraine. Oleksiy Mes, an F-16 pilot, died on August 26 as a result of an air crash during one of the largest massive missile attacks on Ukraine. Others wondered if the crash showed that the F-16 wasn’t even fit for [Ukraine’s](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/Ukraine/)
 mission. The loss of an F-16 so soon after having received them means the issue is “doubly sensitive, if not more so, and no one is talking officially,” according to one high-ranking defense industry executive.

But some details of the incident have come out, and sources have helped fill in some gaps for Breaking Defense, including around the theory that the loss was the result of shrapnel that hit the plane.

With it comes a picture of an incredibly dangerous mission where the loss of jets may have been more a question of when, not if — a deadly reality that, Ukrainian experts say, is being exacerbated by the patchwork of capabilities Kyiv has been forced to use in its defense.

Integration Challenge
---------------------

However, the jets are only part of the complex operational sphere.

Ukrainian defense industry specialists, who are closely intertwined with the military and support both the air defense units and F-16s, told Breaking Defense that these missile intercept missions involving fighter aircraft and air defense batteries operating jointly require precision coordination.

Complicating this coordination, multiple sources said, is the fact that neither the PSU fighters nor the air defense units on the ground are using IFF in these engagements. (The MoD and PSU did not return requests for comment on the use of IFF by press time.)

This caused several industry and military sources — and even a [member of the Ukraine parliament](https://ukranews.com/en/news/1030564-friendly-fire-considered-as-one-of-versions-of-f-16-plane-crash-voice-of-america#google_vignette)
 — to claim the F-16 was a victim of friendly fire. It is a dangerous mission, and I fear more aircraft will be lost in this same tragic manner.”

NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/30/g-s1-20234/ukraine-f16-warplane-crash](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/30/g-s1-20234/ukraine-f16-warplane-crash)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/world/video/ukraine-f16-crashes-npw-nr-intl-digvid](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/world/video/ukraine-f16-crashes-npw-nr-intl-digvid)) both contain images of F-16 fighter jets.

Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukrainian-pilot-oleksiy-mes-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-crash-war-in-ukraine-russia-attack/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukrainian-pilot-oleksiy-mes-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-crash-war-in-ukraine-russia-attack/)) published an article about a Ukrainian pilot who died in an F-16 fighter jet crash. <image:7865>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has F-16 fighter jets. The Politico.eu article mentions a Ukrainian pilot who died in an F-16 crash. However, the evidence does not confirm the cause of the crash or whether it was shot down by Russia.

The image search results do not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows an F-16 shot down by Russia. More information is needed to confirm the cause of the crash and the identity of the aircraft in the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report on the crash of Ukrainian F-16 fighter jets. The Aviation Safety Network ([https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/415138](https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/415138)) states that an F-16 crashed on August 26, 2024, in Kurhany, Rivne Oblast, Ukraine, during a Russian Federation missile and drone strike, killing the pilot. CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia)) reported on June 29, 2025, about another F-16 crash and the death of a pilot.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian F-16 fighter jets have crashed. The Aviation Safety Network reports a crash on August 26, 2024, during a Russian Federation missile and drone strike. Other sources also report on F-16 crashes and pilot deaths. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts an F-16 shot down by Russia.

A supposed [photo](https://x.com/pmigse/status/1928413287043002498)
 of a destroyed Ukrainian Air Force base after a bombardment by Russian Iskanders is being circulated online. <image:7930>

 shared by the Facebook account “Military Aviation”

Certain details of the original image indicate it was generated by AI. <image:7932>

Fire spots at the base

The wreckage of the destroyed aircraft is scattered too chaotically and does not match the trajectory of a real explosion. However, they do not yet form the core of Ukraine’s combat fleet, making it unlikely that so many F-16s would be stationed at a single base. <image:7934>

**However, this is a photo fake. <image:7929>

Screenshot of the [post](https://x.com/pmigse/status/1928413287043002498)

Using reverse search, we found that the image was first shared by the Facebook page “Military Aviation”. This is a common occurrence when AI generates a complex image with many elements: the tool prioritizes overall composition, sacrificing the accuracy of individual details, especially the background and corners.! <image:7931>

Error in the aircraft design made by AI

Although fires and smoke are visible in the background, the allegedly damaged planes in the foreground do not show clear signs of burning, melted metal, or soot, which would be typical for such large-scale destruction. Such a concentration of destroyed planes along with completely intact ones in a small area looks unrealistic."

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to the media in front of an F-16

One of the F-16 fighter jets sent from Nato allies to Ukraine has been destroyed, a Ukrainian military source has told the BBC.

The aircraft went down amid a barrage of Russian missiles on Monday, killing pilot Oleksiy Mes, Ukraine's military said. It marks the first loss of its kind since the planes were delivered earlier this month.

The cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy missile strike, the Ukrainian military claims.

It said the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one drone in Russia's largest aerial attack to date.

*   [Ukraine receives first F-16 fighter jets](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ng1p72wlwo)
    

"Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles," the Ukrainian Air Force wrote in a statement on social media.

"Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life."

The statement did not specify the type of plane involved, but a military source told the BBC the pilot was flying an F-16.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially confirmed on Tuesday the US-made F-16s were being deployed to shoot down Russian drones and missiles.

This week, he asked allies to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to hit targets further into Russia.

Dutch Chief of Defence Gen Onno Eichelsheim confirmed the Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 24 of the jets, in addition to more weapons.

There will be no restrictions on their usage apart from complying with humanitarian law, he told a conference in Washington on Wednesday - meaning Kyiv could launch deeper strikes into Russian territory.

Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023.

Ukraine's F-16s work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground.

They also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States.

The destruction of the aircraft is a blow to President Zelensky, who said he will deliver a ["victory plan"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrlnl2vqe2o)
 to US President Joe Biden next month.

He also revealed Ukraine had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile, but declined to share any more details.

Newsweek AI is in beta. A Ukrainian Air Force F-16 jet enters attack range in the direction of occupied by Russian army Kurakhove on February 17, 2025 in Dnipropetrovsk Region, Ukraine. The pilot took the plane away from the settlement and successfully ejected.

"Thanks to the prompt work of the search and rescue team, the pilot was quickly found and evacuated.

"The pilot's health is satisfactory, he is in a safe place, life and health are not threatened."

Officials are investigating what happened.

The first set of F-16 deliveries from European allies arrived in Ukraine in July 2024, and it was hoped they would help to shift the balance in Russia's war.

The U.S.-made F-16 jets are more advanced than the Soviet-era aircraft Ukraine's forces had been using before.

Ukraine's Previous F-16 Losses
------------------------------

In April, the Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Viper jet [was killed during a combat mission](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-2058982)
. He was named as 26-year-old Pavlo Ivanov.

Ukraine's air force did not reveal the location or many details about the incident in its statement on Telegram, which started with "unfortunately, sad news."

It said Ivanov had died in battle "defending his native land from the occupiers."

The statement said Ukraine's F-16 pilots perform near daily combat missions "in incredibly difficult conditions," providing cover for aviation strike groups and striking enemy targets.

It also said that pilots are working to the maximum of human and technical capabilities, risking their lives each time.

The August before saw Ukraine's first F-16 loss when pilot Oleksii "Moonfish" Mes was [killed while responding to a Russian missile attack](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-russia-f-16-crash-pilot-death-1946329)
. Inconsistencies may occur.

Ukraine has lost another F-16 after an emergency forced the pilot to eject during a mission to repel a Russian attack, said the Ukrainian Air Force in a post on Telegram.

Pilot Ejected During F-16 Emergency
-----------------------------------

The air force post said communication was lost with the aircraft at around 3:30 a.m. 

"Oleksii destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack drone while repelling a massive Russian combined air and missile attack," Ukraine's Western Air Command said at the time.

"Oleksii saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. <image:7944>](/brownie-bushtok-trump-helps-soften-bush-katrina-turns-20-2120306)

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

US shifts nuclear focus to counter China’s growing arsenal

[Amrita Jash](/the-interpreter/contributors/articles/amrita-jash)

Beijing’s nuclear modernisation means its intentions and commitments to non-proliferation will continue to be questioned.

Listen to this article

[_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.WlFr.MEPeOr7CqMnA&smid=url-share)
 has reported that in March, US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States. The paper goes on to say that for the first time, America’s deterrent strategy has reoriented to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, as it also seeks to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.

This shift in Washington’s policy comes after a Pentagon assessment that over the next decade China’s nuclear arsenal stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of those in the United States and Russia. It has been accused of transferring nuclear and missile technology to proliferators such as Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran, leading the Biden administration to [impose stricter export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-tightens-export-controls-nuclear-power-items-china-2023-08-18/)
 on nuclear materials and technology to China.

These developments underscore that as China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come. The Russia-Ukraine war has only reinforced this idea.

Without economic incentives or offering entree to the White House, South Korea could find itself sidelined in North Korea diplomacy. In its [Annual Report to Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
 last year, the US Department of Defence highlighted two key aspects of China’s nuclear capabilities: First, that China has more than 500 active nuclear weapons, exceeding earlier estimates of 400 warheads, and following [earlier assessments](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-Military-AndSecurity-Developments-Involving-The-Peoples-Republic-Of-China.pdf)
 is expected to have a stockpile of about 1,500 warheads by 2035; and second, that in keeping with its modernisation objectives, China is expected to have more than 1,000 operable nuclear weapons by 2030, many of which will probably be “deployed at higher readiness levels”.

A White House spokesperson was careful to say the new plan was “not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat” and that the guidance provided, while secret, was in keeping with actions taken by earlier administrations.

Beijing, however, raised “grave concerns” over the reported plan, with [China’s Foreign Ministry](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202408/t20240821_11477550.html)
 declaring “the US has called China a ‘nuclear threat’ and used it as a convenient pretext to shirk its obligation of nuclear disarmament, expand its own nuclear arsenal, and seek absolute strategic predominance.”

China has restated its “no first use” policy, saying it has “no intention to engage in any form of arms race with other countries”, while accusing the United States of being “the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world”. Beijing said Washington would be better to make “drastic and substantive cuts to its nuclear arsenal”, and to stop “nuclear sharing” and other “negative moves that undermine global and regional peace and stability”.

As China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come.

Of the nine nuclear-armed powers, China has one of the fastest-growing nuclear arsenals at present. So, to state that China seeks to have parity with the United States or Russia cannot be blithely dismissed. Any increase in China’s nuclear stockpile raises serious concerns, given the opaque nature of the country’s nuclear capabilities and its modernisation ambitions. China’s intentions continue to be guided by Deng Xiaoping’s observations that nuclear force enhancements were necessary “[to earn more say and a higher international status in a coming world order](https://www.academia.edu/23440377/The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments_The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments)

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. Since then, Iran has [progressed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explainer-how-close-is-iran-having-nuclear-weapons-2024-04-18/#:~:text=That%20means%20Iran's%20so%2Dcalled,matter%20of%20weeks%20or%20days.)
 steadily closer to a nuclear weapon, much closer than it would have had the deal remained in place.

Coming in a close second in terms of consequential nuclear decision-making was Trump’s policy toward North Korea. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. He [threatened](http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1708/09/nday.01.html)
 that North Korea would be “met with fire, fury, and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before,” which most observers took to be a thinly veiled nuclear threat. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a military parade in Poland on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations, which began on August 14. The image search results show that tanks were part of the parade.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state the purpose of the parade was to prepare for war with Russia. The parade is described as an expression of strength and a celebration of Armed Forces Day.
