The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While Ukrainian forces controlled Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and Zelensky has been photographed in military settings, there is no evidence to confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha or met with representatives there. The geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in Ukraine, but not necessarily in Sudzha.

So, the overall veracity is: false
