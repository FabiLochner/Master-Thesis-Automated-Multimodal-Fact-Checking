Content: The Euronews article, published on September 18, 2024, discusses a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast. The facility, renovated in 2018, stored an estimated 30,000 tonnes of military munitions, including explosives, artillery shells, and ballistic missiles. The article mentions that the site was said to meet "the highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack". The article also mentions that the destruction of the ammunition will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army. The article states that the military site reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition. According to Ukrainian sources, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets. The article includes images showing the damage from the attack. <image:23>

Content: The Associated Press published an article about a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Russia.

The claim '<image:23> This image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after it was hit by a, possible nuclear, strike from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a Ukrainian drone strike, not a NATO strike as the claim suggests. Multiple sources, including CNN ([https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e)), confirm the Ukrainian origin of the attack.
