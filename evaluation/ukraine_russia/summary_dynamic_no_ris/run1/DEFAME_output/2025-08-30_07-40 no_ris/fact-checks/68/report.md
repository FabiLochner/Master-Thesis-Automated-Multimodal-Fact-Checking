## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to several committees, including the Finance Committee, and the House Committee on the Judiciary. John Thune was assigned to committees such as the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The evidence does not explicitly state that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether John Thune had the power to block Adam Schiff's assignments and whether he did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/schiff-will-place-hold-on-ed-martin-nom-citing-demolished-firewalls-between-wh-and-doj): 
Content: The article from Talking Points Memo, published on April 2, 2025, discusses Adam Schiff's intention to place a hold on the nomination of Ed Martin. ![image 7819](media/2025-08-30_08-00-1756540816-765578.jpg) The article mentions that Schiff is a Senate Judiciary Committee member. The article also mentions that senators have the authority to place a hold on a presidential nominee. The article does not mention John Thune.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from January 25, 2023, reports that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy denied Adam Schiff a seat on the House Intelligence Committee, citing the misuse of the panel during the 116th and 117th Congresses as the reason. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg), ![image 5](media/6.jpg) The NPR article also reports that McCarthy blocked Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee, stating that Schiff's actions undermined national security. ![image 7861](media/2025-08-30_08-01-1756540865-325890.jpg) Schiff stated that McCarthy's actions were political retribution for Schiff's role in the impeachment of Donald Trump. The PBS article discusses a censure resolution against Adam Schiff for comments he made about investigations into Donald Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia and mentions that McCarthy said he would block Schiff from the House intelligence committee.

The provided sources do not mention John Thune.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee. The reasons cited were the misuse of the panel and political retribution for Schiff's role in the impeachment of Donald Trump. The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee. The claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments is not supported by the evidence.
