Content: The New York Times published an article on May 2, 2024, about the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. <image:7491>

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is disputed. While the image's geolocation is uncertain, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Newsweek. However, the U.S. Department of State has accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.

So, the overall veracity is: false
