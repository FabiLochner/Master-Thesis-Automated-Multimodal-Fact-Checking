The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/1/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-the-war-with-russia) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), confirm that Russia initiated the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The conflict's origins can be traced back to 2014, with no evidence supporting Zelenskyy's role in starting the war.

So, the overall veracity is: false
