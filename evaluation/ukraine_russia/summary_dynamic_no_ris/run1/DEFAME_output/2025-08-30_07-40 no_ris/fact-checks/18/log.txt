Content: Meduza, November 26, 2024, reports that Nikita Zhuravel, convicted in February for burning a Quran, received an additional 13.5 years in prison. Factoring in time served, he will spend 14 years incarcerated. Zhuravel was arrested in May 2023 for burning a Quran. In October 2024, he was charged with collaborating with Ukraine's security services.

The claim 'In November 2024 Russia sentenced a man to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran.' is false.
Justification: In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. While the initial conviction was for burning the Quran, the 14-year sentence was primarily for treason, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/). The total sentence of 14 years includes the sentence for burning the Quran and an additional sentence for treason, as stated by [The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123) and [Meduza](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case).
