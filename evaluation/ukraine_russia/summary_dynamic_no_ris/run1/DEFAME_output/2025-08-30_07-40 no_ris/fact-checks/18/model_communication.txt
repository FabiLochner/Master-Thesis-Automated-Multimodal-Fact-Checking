LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - A Russian man serving time in prison for burning a copy of the Koran was found guilty by a court on Monday in a separate treason case and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

A regional court in Volgograd in southwestern Russia said it had convicted Nikita Zhuravel, 20, of state treason for corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation."

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Frussian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25%2F)

Zhuravel's case drew attention last year when Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov published video showing his son Adam, then 15, beating and kicking him while he was in prison in Chechnya awaiting trial for burning a Koran in Volgograd, his hometown.

Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Islamic faith in the overwhelmingly Muslim republic, where Zhuravel was transferred after what Russian investigators said was public pressure from Chechens.

The office of Russia's Prosecutor General said last month that Zhuravel had also been accused of sending footage of a freight train carrying warplanes, and information about the movements of a car linked to a Russian military base to a representative of Ukrainian intelligence.

Zhuravel had pleaded guilty to the crime, the court said in a statement on Telegram on Monday, adding that he had been opposed to what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Russia rarely comments on individual criminal cases.

Zhuravel is serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence following his [conviction](/world/europe/court-russias-chechnya-sentences-man-3-12-years-koran-burning-tass-2024-02-27/)
 in February under Russia's law against offending religious believers. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

!Court in Russia's Chechnya hears case of man who burned Koran copy <image:1874>

Defendant Nikita Zhuravel attends a court hearing in the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russia, February 27, 2024. Investigators said he had confessed to publicly burning the Koran in a stunt paid for by Ukrainian intelligence.

It was not clear under what circumstances the alleged confession was made.

The number of such cases has risen sharply in Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, as intelligence agencies pursue a crackdown on suspected foreign spies and agents.

Yevgeny Smirnov, a member of a Russian lawyers' association called Pervy Otdel (First Department) which has in the past helped defend people accused of treason, said Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, sometimes tries to entrap people.

He said the FSB contacts people known to be opposed to the war over the internet and encouraged them to commit crimes, such as setting fire to military buildings or sending sensitive information related to the Russian military.

Reuters could not independently verify his assertion."

Zhuravel accused Adam Kadyrov, the 15-year-old son of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, of beating him in pre-trial detention in August 2023. His trial was held behind closed doors, with Zhuravel transported from Chechnya to Volgograd for hearings that began on November 14.

The human rights group Memorial has designated Zhuravel a political prisoner.

! Kadyrov later shared a video of the assault, which law enforcement declined to investigate.

Following the widely publicized incident, several regional authorities awarded the younger Kadyrov state honors.

On Monday, the Volgograd Regional Court [convicted](https://v1.ru/text/gorod/2024/11/25/74374478/?sharePost=1237723&utm_campaign=5961503_1237723&utm_medium=v1.ru&utm_source=sharepostonline "convicted")
 Zhuravel of “high treason,” sentencing him to an additional 13 years and six months at a maximum-security prison, according to the v1.ru news website.

He will now spend a total of 14 years in prison on the combined charges, prosecutors [said](https://epp.genproc.gov.ru/web/gprf/mass-media/news?item=99306845 "said")
 later on Monday.

It remains unclear whether Zhuravel pleaded guilty to the new treason charges. Never miss the latest news from Russia. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."

These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia."

Man beaten in police custody for burning Quran gets 13.5 years for ‘treason’ against Russia in separate case

The man convicted this February of burning a copy of the Quran had another 13.5 years added to his prison sentence on Monday. Factoring in time already served, Nikita Zhuravel will spend the next 14 years incarcerated following a court ruling in Volgograd.

Police arrested Zhuravel in May 2023 for burning a Quran in front of Volgograd’s Cathedral Mosque, supposedly in coordination with Ukraine’s intelligence community, in an alleged scheme to incite sectarian conflict. In October 2024, several months after his first conviction, prosecutors charged Zhuravel with volunteering to collaborate with Ukraine’s security services. Officials accused him of providing Kyiv with videos of Russian military equipment and aircraft, including the movements of a specific vehicle in the unit."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that in November 2024, a man named Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the Reuters report indicates that the 14-year sentence was for treason, separate from his previous conviction for burning the Quran. The Moscow Times and Meduza clarify that the 14-year sentence is a combination of the sentence for burning the Quran and an additional sentence for treason.

Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers in a serious violation of international law, the Dutch and German intelligence agencies have said.

On Friday, they said there was extensive evidence that Moscow’s forces were using banned products, including the choking agent chloropicrin.

Russia denies using the prohibited weapons, as does Ukraine. This means looking at more sanctions and specifically not allowing them (Russia) to participate in international bodies like the Executive Council of the OPCW (the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons),” Brekelmans said.

The OPCW said last year that Russian and Ukrainian accusations that the other side was using banned weapons were “insufficiently substantiated”.

The disarmament agency, which is based in The Hague and has 193 member states, has not conducted a full investigation, something which can only happen at the request of member states.

Fighting grinds on
------------------

The allegations of increased Russian chemical weapons use came as Ukraine reported the largest ever [Russian drone and missile attack](/news/2025/7/4/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1226)
 on the country.

A Ukrainian air force official told local media it is the biggest of the war so far, with Moscow firing 539 drones and 11 missiles overnight.

The attacks on Kyiv injured at least 23 people, damaging railway infrastructure and setting buildings and cars on fire, authorities said.

A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Rostov region killed at least one woman and forced the evacuation of dozens of people from their homes, the acting governor said.

In the meantime, on Friday, both countries confirmed that they had carried out their latest prisoner exchange, with neither side giving details about the number of soldiers involved.

The swap followed an agreement made in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, in June.

On the diplomatic front, United States President Donald Trump said he had made no progress, expressing his “disappointment”, during his phone call on Thursday with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who reportedly [reiterated](/news/2025/7/3/russia-will-not-back-down-on-ukraine-war-goals-putin-tells-trump)
 he would stop his invasion only if the conflict’s “root causes” were tackled.

Trump also said he was planning to discuss the conflict with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. Chloropicrin is dropped by drones to drive soldiers out of trenches, and then kill them,” Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in a post on X, referring to Russia’s purported use.

Brekelmans, who is now calling for tougher sanctions against Russia, described the use of chemical weapons as “horrible and unacceptable”.

Peter Reesink, the head of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), confirmed that the findings were based on its own investigations. There were “thousands of instances” of chemical weapons use by Russia, he said.

“This isn’t just some ad hoc tinkering at the front line; it is truly part of a large-scale programme. And that is, of course, also concerning because if we don’t clarify and publicise what Russia is doing, it’s highly likely these trends will continue,” Reesink added.

Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency also corroborated the MIVD’s conclusions.

The Russian army was using tear gas as well as “the more dangerous chemical chloropicrin, which can be lethal in high concentrations in enclosed spaces” in Ukraine, the BND said in a statement.

“This represents a more serious violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of this lung warfare agent under all circumstances,” it noted.

Speaking to Reuters about the Dutch and German intelligence reports, Brekelmans, the Dutch defence minister, said that at least three Ukrainian deaths had been linked to Russian chemical weapons, with more than 2,500 people reporting symptoms related to the banned products.

More needed to be done to deter Russia from deploying such weapons, he suggested.

“We must further increase the pressure. Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump about the supply of US [weapons to Ukraine](/news/2025/7/2/us-halts-some-weapons-shipments-to-ukraine)
.

The US said on Tuesday that it was halting some weapons deliveries to Kyiv that were promised under the Biden administration, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine.

The Biden administration-era pledges, which included various munitions to bolster Ukraine’s defences, are now under review as the Pentagon reassesses current inventory levels."

On the eve of his killing, Ukraine's SBU declared that he had been named in absentia in a criminal case for the "mass use" of prohibited chemical weapons on the eastern and southern fronts in Ukraine.

It cited "more than 4,800 cases of the enemy using chemical munitions" on Ukrainian territory since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.

It said toxic substances had been used in drone attacks as well as in combat grenades.

Kirillov earned his notoriety from the start of the war with a series of claims directed towards both Ukraine and the West, none of which was based on fact.

Among his most outrageous claims was one that [the US had been building biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60711705)
. It was used in an attempt to justify the full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbour in 2022.

He produced documents in March 2022 which he claimed had been seized by Russia on the day of the invasion on 24 February - which were amplified by pro-Kremlin media but rubbished by independent experts.

Kirillov's notorious allegations against Ukraine continued into this year.

Last month he claimed that "one of the priority aims" of Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russia's Kursk border region was to seize the Kursk nuclear power plant.

He presented a slideshow, purportedly based on a Ukrainian report, alleging that in the event of an accident only Russia territory would be exposed to radioactive contamination.

One of Kirillov's repeated themes was that Ukraine was seeking to develop a "dirty bomb".

Two years ago he alleged that "two organisations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called 'dirty bomb'.

Igor Kirillov: Russia's chemical weapons chief and mouthpiece killed in Moscow
==============================================================================

17 December 2024

As head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops, Igor Kirillov - who has died in an explosion in Moscow - was accused by the West of overseeing the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.

In Russia, he was viewed as a tireless patriot, fighting for the truth and exposing Western "crimes".

Sources from Ukraine's SBU security service said it it was behind the blast and referred to a special operation against a "war criminal" and a legitimate target.

Kirillov and an aide were killed by explosives planted in an electric scooter, according to Russian officials, which was blown up as he left the building he lived in on Ryazansky Prospekt in south-eastern Moscow.

He had become notorious for outlandish briefings at the Russian defence ministry which prompted the UK Foreign Office to label him as a ["significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yj5qepe4wo)
.

Kirillov was far more than just a mouthpiece, heading Russia's Timoshenko Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Academy, before going on to lead the Russian army's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops in 2017.

The force's main tasks involve identifying hazards and protecting units from contamination but also "causing loss to the enemy by using flame-incendiary means", the Russian defence ministry says. That is thought to refer to Russia's flame-thrower system that can destroy targets with the use of thermobaric warheads.

[The UK Foreign Office said](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sanctions-russian-troops-deploying-chemical-weapons-on-the-battlefield)
 that the force Kirillov commanded had deployed "barbaric chemical weapons in Ukraine", highlighting what it said was the widespread use of riot control agents and "multiple reports of the use of the toxic choking agent chloropicrin".

! This work is in its final stage".

His claims were rejected by Western countries as "transparently false".

But Kirillov's claims prompted Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to warn that if Russia suggested Kyiv was preparing that kind of weapon, it meant only one thing - that Russia was already preparing it.

Igor Kirillov (R) was put in charge of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops seven years ago

Kirillov returned to his dirty bomb claims last summer, this time alleging the discovery of a chemical weapons laboratory close to Avdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine that the Russians captured last February.

Kyiv, he claimed, was violating the international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) with a variety of substances with the assistance of Western countries, including the psychochemical warfare agent BZ as well as hydrocyanic acid and cyanogen chloride.

Russia is a signatory to the CWC and was adjudged to have destroyed all its Cold War-era chemical weapons in 2017. The following year Russian agents carried out a deadly attack on the British city of Salisbury using the nerve agent Novichok.

The US has since accused Russia of using the choking agent chloropicrin on the battlefield in Ukraine.

Kirillov's violent death has come as a shock to Russia's military and political establishment."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could have been taken in Ukraine or Russia, as the geolocation data indicates. The image search results confirm that there was an incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Kursk region in August 2024. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the use of chemical weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The web search results mention the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Content: "Such cases occurred, for example, in August 2023 near the settlement of Rabotino, Zaporozhye region of the Russian Federation, and in May 2024 in the Graivoronsky district, Belgorod region of the Russian Federation.

Ukraine uses NATO-style 155 mm calibre cluster smoke producing munitions filled with a metal chloride smoke mixture, as for example in the case of a chemical attack on 10 August 2024 in the town of Sudzha, Kursk region. In October 2023 and March 2024, detailed evidence was circulated to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Security Council and the United Nations (UN) General Assembly of the large‑scale use of toxic chemicals by the Kiev regime in violation of Ukraine's obligations under the CWC, as well as provocations orchestrated by the Kiev regime and its Western patrons to accuse the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of similar acts.

The situation has not changed over the past months – Ukrainian armed formations continue to systematically use toxic chemicals, including those listed in Schedules 2 and 3 of the CWC, as well as RCAs against units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and civilians. Hand grenades with irritants labelled “Teren 6” have been repeatedly used by neo-Nazis when storming Russian positions on the territory of Donetsk People's Republic (particularly in the cities of Artemovsk and Mariupol, near Avdeevka settlement) and Lugansk People's Republic (Zaliman settlement), and a cache of these ammunition has also been found on the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic of the Russian Federation.

_Teren 6 gas grenades found at captured positions of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Donetsk People's Republic of the Russian Federation in late 2023 – early 2024_

Cases in which Ukrainian armed formations launched artillery strikes against positions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation using 152 mm calibre munitions filled with toxic chemicals, mostly chloropicrin, were recorded. The investigative authorities of the Russian Federation initiated criminal proceedings under the Article 205 “Act of Terrorism” and Article 355 “Development, Manufacture, Stockpiling, Acquisition or Sale of Weapons of Mass Destruction” of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation against three citizens of Ukraine, who were detained in preparation for the terrorist act and confessed.

_Ampoules with toxic chemicals seized from a hideout during the detention of Ukrainian citizens_

Also in February 2024, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation in St. Petersburg uncovered and stopped the illegal activities of a clandestine cell of the Ukrainian paramilitary terrorist organization "Russian Volunteer Corps" (RVC) operating in the interests of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. The requested nomenclature also includes 150,000 antidote kits and 20,000 tests for the rapid detection of chemical warfare agents.

_Projected supplies of personal protective equipment and antidotes to Ukraine in 2024_

In 2023, NATO countries already supplied Ukraine with personal protective equipment (more than 55,000 kits), antidotes for organophosphorus agents (600,000 ampoules), as well as drugs for detoxification of mustard gas, lewisite and hydrogen cyanide derivatives (750,000 vials).

In addition, a number of Western countries – Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States and others – generously sponsor, including through the OPCW, Ukraine's activities within the framework of so-called "protective" measures.

\*    \*    \*

The incidents cited as examples – in addition to the information already made public in October 2023 and in February 2024 – clearly demonstrate the numerous instances of the use of toxic chemicals and RCAs by the special services and militants of the Kiev regime as a method of warfare and for terrorist purposes, coupled with provocations at chemical industry facilities of Donbass. There is an urgent need to contrast common sense with the irrepressible ambitions of the countries of the "collective West" to turn the OPCW, along with other specialised multilateral structures, into an instrument for achieving their geopolitical interests and imposing ambiguous cultural and civilizational values and double standards on the absolute majority of the world community.

The Russian Federation will continue to record and bring to the attention of the States Parties to the CWC data on the use by armed formations of the Kiev regime of toxic chemicals against Russian servicemen and civilians and on the plans of Ukrainian militants to organise provocations against chemical facilities in the Donbass and other regions of the Russian Federation.

**RUSSIAN FEDERATION**

**On the Continuing Use of Toxic Chemicals  
by Ukrainian Armed Formations**

The Russian Federation continues to monitor and record the use of scheduled chemicals, riot control agents (RCAs) and chemicals not listed in the Schedules of the Chemical Weapons Convention (hereinafter, the “CWC”) by Ukrainian armed formations in the Special Military Operation (SMO) zone. More than 400 cases of use of non-lethal toxic chemicals by the Ukrainian side have been recorded during the SMO, most of them have been confirmed by relevant researches.

 [![](/upload/medialibrary/e94/4a5t9807y2s7e9gry51yr6me4cpdxbly/1.png)](/upload/medialibrary/e94/4a5t9807y2s7e9gry51yr6me4cpdxbly/1.png)
  
_Some cases of use of toxic chemicals by Ukraine_

The practice of dropping various kinds of improvised munitions and grenades filled with toxic substances and containers with chemicals (unknown in a number of cases) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has continued unabated.

_The so-called "Baba Yaga": an UAV originally designed for agricultural use with a payload capacity over 20 kg, which the Kiev regime initially planned to use to deliver containers with toxic substances and disperse them as aerosols_

_FPV drones equipped with containers full of toxic substances_

\*    \*    \*

Investigations into the use of toxic chemicals by the Ukrainian side are carried out by the Russian Federation in accordance with the CWC by means of field and fixed-site laboratories capable of reliably identifying the type of a chemical compound and often the producer country. The combustion products of this mixture have a strong irritant effect on the upper respiratory tract, and can also cause fatal poisoning due to the formation of toxic substances (zinc chloride, carbon monoxide and phosgene, included in the Schedule 3 on toxic chemicals (para.1) of the Annex on Chemicals to the CWC.

There is evidence that the military forces of the Kiev regime used adamsite and a chemical mixture based on sulfuric and nitric acid – toxic agents that affect upper respiratory tract, resulting in slow heart rate, increased blood pressure and sudden respiratory arrest – in April 2024 near the town of Kleshcheyevka (Donetsk People's Republic of the Russian Federation). Tests revealed the presence of bio-toxins, in particular, ricin, listed in Schedule 1 of the CWC Annex on Chemicals, BZ chemical warfare agent, listed in Schedule 2 of the CWC Annex on Chemicals, and phenolic compounds.

In August 2022 one of the leaders of a Russian region was hospitalised with signs of acute poisoning."

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could have been taken in Ukraine or Russia, as the geolocation data indicates. The image search results confirm that there was an incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Kursk region in August 2024. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the use of chemical weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The web search results mention the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

However, it added that the situation in Ukraine "remains volatile and extremely concerning regarding the possible re-emergence of use of toxic chemicals as weapons."

The acting governor of the embattled Kursk Oblast has accused Ukraine of poisoning civilians with chemical weapons during the incursion into Russian territory.

During a Monday meeting with [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
, Aleksey Smirnov told the president that a group of workers for the Rosseti power company "came under fire" from Ukrainian forces over the weekend, Russian state-run news agency RT reported.

According to Smirnov, while the workers took cover in a local police station, they were targeted with shells "contain\[ing\] chemical weapons," and alongside several police officers and the head of the village council, were "poisoned" as a result.

_Newsweek_ could not verify the claim made by Smirnov, and has contacted the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry for comment on the governor's allegations.

Accusations of the kind made by Smirnov are far from a new occurrence in the ongoing conflict, and form part of the concurrent propaganda war undertaken by both Moscow and Kyiv in a bid to tarnish the reputation of their opponent.

Since the outbreak of the war, both sides have traded accusations of chemical weapons use, and [other violations of international law.](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-says-russian-troops-beheaded-soldiers-donetsk-1914406)

In May, the U.S. Russia's President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting regarding the situation in the Kursk region, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, on August 12, 2024. The governor of Russia's Kursk region, Aleksey Smirnov, joined the meeting via videoconference, and told Putin that Ukraine had used "shells contain\[ning\] chemical weapons" against civilians in the area.

The meeting between Smirnov and Putin was convened to discuss the ongoing crisis in Kursk, where Ukrainian forces have [continued to make significant headway](https://www.newsweek.com/kursk-ukraine-russia-map-1937768)
 since last Tuesday's [surprise cross-border raid](https://www.newsweek.com/russians-evacuated-ukraines-incursion-turns-kursk-war-zone-1935623)
.

Smirnov went on to say that, since the start of the incursion, 12 civilians have been killed in the region, with a further 121 injured.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, via Telegram, Ukraine has so far lost up to 1,610 servicemembers, over 200 combat vehicles, as well as four anti-aircraft missile systems.

During the Monday meeting, Putin also [reacted to Smirnov's claim](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-kursk-region-offensive-evacuations-1937925)
 that Ukraine now controls 28 settlements in Kursk, and called on the country's military to "knock the enemy out of our territories."

The president added that that the incursion had closed the door to any potential negotiations with Ukraine, saying: "What kind of negotiations can we have with those who indiscriminately attack civilians and civilian infrastructure, or pose threats to nuclear power facilities? What is there to discuss with such parties?"

Claim: "<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:12>)
web_search("Kursk offensive chemical attack")
image_search("chemical attack Kursk offensive")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on July 4, 2025, stating that Dutch and German intelligence agencies said Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers, mentioning the use of chloropicrin. The BBC published an article on December 17, 2024, about the death of Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops, who was accused of overseeing the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. The BBC article mentions "more than 4,800 cases of the enemy using chemical munitions" on Ukrainian territory since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War published a map of the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast as of August 10, 2024, which indicates the Ukrainian forces advanced west of Semenovka. ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024)) <image:7477> Al Jazeera published an article on August 12, 2024, about the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/12/has-ukraines-incursion-into-russias-kursk-changed-dynamics-of-the-war](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/12/has-ukraines-incursion-into-russias-kursk-changed-dynamics-of-the-war)) <image:7478>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could have been taken in Ukraine or Russia, as the geolocation data indicates. The image search results confirm that there was an incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Kursk region in August 2024. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the use of chemical weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The web search results mention the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Claim: "<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:12>)
web_search("Kursk offensive chemical attack")
image_search("chemical attack Kursk offensive")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on July 4, 2025, stating that Dutch and German intelligence agencies said Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers, mentioning the use of chloropicrin. The BBC published an article on December 17, 2024, about the death of Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops, who was accused of overseeing the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. The BBC article mentions "more than 4,800 cases of the enemy using chemical munitions" on Ukrainian territory since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.

The image <image:12>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War published a map of the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast as of August 10, 2024, which indicates the Ukrainian forces advanced west of Semenovka. ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024)) <image:7477> Al Jazeera published an article on August 12, 2024, about the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/12/has-ukraines-incursion-into-russias-kursk-changed-dynamics-of-the-war](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/12/has-ukraines-incursion-into-russias-kursk-changed-dynamics-of-the-war)) <image:7478>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could have been taken in Ukraine or Russia, as the geolocation data indicates. The image search results confirm that there was an incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Kursk region in August 2024. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the use of chemical weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The web search results mention the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs published an article on December 25, 2024, alleging the use of chemical weapons by Ukrainian forces, specifically mentioning a chemical attack on August 10, 2024, in Sudzha, Kursk region, and the use of NATO-style 155 mm calibre cluster smoke producing munitions filled with a metal chloride smoke mixture. The article also mentions the use of chloropicrin and other toxic chemicals by Ukrainian forces. (<image:12>) Newsweek published an article on August 12, 2024, stating that the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons against civilians during the incursion into Russian territory. (<image:7482>, <image:7483>) The article also mentions that the U.S. Department of State accused Russia of using the chemical weapon chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on March 27, 2024, about the war in Ukraine, including an image of an explosion (<image:7490>). The New York Times published an article on May 2, 2024, about the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine (<image:7491>).


## Elaboration
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs alleges that Ukrainian forces used chemical weapons in the Kursk region on August 10, 2024, specifically mentioning an attack in Sudzha. Newsweek reported that the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion. The U.S. Department of State has accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops. While the evidence includes claims of chemical weapon use, it is important to note that these claims come from the Russian government and should be considered with caution.


## Final Judgement
The initial search did not provide enough information to verify the claim. However, subsequent searches revealed conflicting claims. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. The U.S. Department of State accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

While the image's geolocation is uncertain, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Newsweek. However, the U.S. Department of State has accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.

The law, adopted August 20, 2024, prohibits the Russian Orthodox Church from operating in Ukraine and bans any religious organization in Ukraine with ties to it or any other religious organizations based in countries “engaged in armed aggression against Ukraine.” It authorizes the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience to identify links between Ukrainian religious organizations andthe Russian Orthodox Church.

(Kyiv, October 30, 2024) – [Ukraine’s](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/ukraine)
 new [law](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3894-IX)
 banning religious organizations with ties to the [Russian](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia)
 Orthodox Church is overly broad and could have far-reaching consequences for Ukrainians’ right to religious freedom, Human Rights Watch said today. He noted that there are Ukrainian Orthodox Church congregations in occupied territories that “refuse to join the Russian Orthodox Churchfor many reasons.” He said that the ban would sever the connection with those churches, and that the “Russian Orthodox Church will put their own people in place and that will be the end of it.”

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented multiple incidents in which groups of people forcefully entered churches belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Сhurch, “[justifying their actions](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/ukraine/2024/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-dec-2023-29-feb-2024.pdf)
 with decisions from local authorities to register new religious communities of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine at the same address as existing Ukrainian Orthodox Churchcommunities.” In September, Ukraine [blocked](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/rozporyadzhennya-ncu-vid-12-09-2024-769-2574-pro-blokuvannya-domennikh-imen)
 the website of the outlet DialogTUT, which covered Ukrainian Orthodox Church activities.

Ukraine is obligated under Ukrainian and international law to guarantee religious freedom. The law does not impact the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities should address any security concerns related to the activities of religious bodies or personnel that threaten state security, whether by individuals or specific religious communities, rather than effectively banning entire religious communities based solely on presumed affiliations with the Russian Orthodox Church, Human Rights Watch said. 

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s security service has initiated criminal proceedings [against](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/get-vid-moskvi-k-radi-zbirayutsya-zaboroniti-1723413259.html)
 at least 100 clergymen, most affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on charges of “collaborationism,” treason, and“aiding the aggressor state.” 

Broad implementation of the new law risks severe practical consequences for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s congregations and millions of parishioners, Human Rights Watch said. It said it would develop regulations to implement the law within three months of its publication, to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 

The law considers any ties, not just institutional and organizational, but also canonical, with the Russian Orthodox Church to be grounds for banning it. 

Requiring the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to sever canonical ties may cast doubt on the legitimacy of its adherents’ religious beliefs, which the European Court of Human Rights has identified as a key element of the right to freedom of religion, Human Rights Watch said. “But the law interferes with the right to freedom of religion and is so broad that it could violate the rights of Ukrainian Orthodox Church members.”

The Ukrainian government should suspend implementation of the law and request the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe’s’ Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to provide expert analysis of the law that would be the basis for its rights-respecting revision, Human Rights Watch said.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church was [established](https://risu.ua/ukrajinska-pravoslavna-cerkva-moskovskogo-patriarhatu_n48337)
 in 1990 as an autonomous branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leadership supports Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Yet, in January 2023, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience found these steps insufficient, stating that the “status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as a structural subdivision of the Russian Orthodox Church... remains unchanged.”

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church exists alongside the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was [established](https://www.pomisna.info/uk/document-post/patriarshyj-i-synodalnyj-tomos-nadannya-avtokefalnogo-tserkovnogo-ustroyu-pravoslavnij-tserkvi-v-ukrayini/)
 in 2019 under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. They range from restrictions on ownership and operation of religious properties to difficulties in accessing places of worship and heightened risk of security service surveillance and prosecution.

Any prosecution or penalty not based on specific, unlawful actions but solely on the adherence to a peaceful practice of faith, constitutes religious discrimination and is prohibited by international human rights law. 

In a written response to questions Human Rights Watch sent on October 2, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience said that the law’s main objective is “to prevent the network of religious organizations officially registered in Ukraine from being used against Ukraine.” 

The agency said that Ukraine “does not demand that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church betray the doctrine of the Orthodox Church, change liturgical practices or language, switch to a different liturgical calendar, or join another church jurisdiction. The only requirement that the Law insists on is withdrawing from the Russian Orthodox Church, which is involved in the war against Ukraine.”

The agency also shared recommendations on measures that could be taken to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church."

[Joe Rogan](https://globalnews.ca/tag/joe-rogan/)
 said he will not be attending an upcoming [UFC](https://globalnews.ca/tag/ufc/)
 fight in Montreal because he doesn’t “go to Canada anymore” and joked that he would “rather go to Russia.”

! He’s a sketchy guy,” Rogan said on the podcast.

Rogan also said Trudeau has “some shaky deals” and added that he would “like to see where the money is coming from.” It is still unclear what deals Rogan was referring to.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. “I rather go to Russia.”

Story continues below advertisement

Rogan claimed that Canadian authorities froze bank accounts of people who “only donated to the truckers” and that people are “still in jail” for their participation.

“It was kind of when a lot of people woke up,” Rogan added.

This isn’t the first time Rogan has criticized Canada on the podcast.

In March, Rogan [said he didn’t love Trump’s idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)
 of making Canada the 51st U.S. What comes next?](https://globalnews.ca/news/11320440/air-canada-flight-attendants-vote-strike-timeline/)

Back in July 2022, Rogan [had some strong words about Canada and Trudeau](https://globalnews.ca/news/8997721/joe-rogan-canada-communist-justin-trudeau-sketchy-dictator/)
, voicing his distaste for the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Canada’s communist,” Rogan said on the podcast. <image:2033>

The UFC commentator shared his thoughts on [his podcast, _The Joe Rogan Experience_](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xr-DqSmJEXI?si=Q3f-0swafwYpFl0G)
, when asked if he will be in attendance to watch UFC fighter Belal Muhammad defend his Welterweight gold against Jack Della Maddalena in May.

When Rogan asked his guests Gordon Ryan, Brendan Schaub and Eddie Bravo when the fight is set to take place, they said, “About two months.”

“Where’s that at?” Rogan asked.

_The Joe Rogan Experience_ producer Jamie Vernon told Rogan that the fight will be held in Montreal at UFC 315 on May 10.

“Wow, I won’t be there."

Content: "I’d rather go to Russia,” he said, laughing.

Earlier in the show, Rogan remarked that Canada’s government is “terrible” — but said “the Canadian people are awesome.” 

Rogan said in July that his beef with Canada initially began during the COVID-19 pandemic after thousands of protesting truckers [descended on the capital in Ottawa](https://nypost.com/2022/02/14/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergency-powers-to-quell-protests/)
 and railed against the country’s vaccine mandate, [according to Front Office Sports](https://frontofficesports.com/joe-rogan-canada-massive-ufc-315-event/)
.

President Trump, who Rogan helped throttle to a second term in the White House with an appearance on his podcast days before the 2024 election, has sparked tensions between the US and Canada for [imposing new tariffs](https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/world-news/canadian-pm-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-slams-trump-trade-war/)
 — and suggesting Canada become the 51st state.

The trade war has previously seeped into the sports world, with Canadian fans booing the US national anthem during the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament.

Rogan [admitted last month](https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/joe-rogan-doesnt-want-canada-to-be-us-51st-state/)
 that he does not think Canada should join the union, but wants the two countries to make up and end what he called “the dumbest f–king feud.”

 [!Rogan after a lightweight fight during the UFC 313 event at T-Mobile Arena on March 08, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. UFC commentator Joe Rogan said he won’t go to an upcoming fight because it’s in Canada — joking that he’d “rather go to Russia.”

Rogan gave the brush off on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” when asked about UFC 315 in May being in Montreal.

“Wow. I don’t go to Canada anymore,” he said, having previously spoken out against the Great White North’s spat with President Trump.

White’s sister, Kelly Kneale, [told The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)
 she doesn’t believe there’s a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing.

“I don’t believe it was targeted,” she told the publication. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White’s vehicle, when he interrupted them.”

White, who started working for Infowars around 2021, wrote stories praising President Donald Trump and attacking Democrats.

“EPIC Breaking Video!” reads the headline from one of White’s pieces published last week. “He was shot by a person or persons trying to break into his car for the second time.”

The Austin Police Department is asking for the public’s help in identifying the suspects in White’s killing.

Content: "His sister and local police believe that his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities.**

[Pro-Russian sources](https://archive.ph/MWRtT)
 have spread manipulative headlines claiming that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was allegedly murdered shortly after Ukraine added him to its kill list. Ultra-right-wing and conspiracy-minded InfoWars journalist Jamie White was indeed murdered in Austin on the evening of March 9, on his way home from work. There is no evidence that Jamie White was on any “list of enemies of Ukraine” – and it is doubtful that such a list even exists.

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Yahoo News article published on May 29, 2024, Alex Jones speculated that the killing of Infowars writer Jamie White in Austin, Texas, "could’ve been a hit" orchestrated by Ukraine.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The shooting of InfoWars writer Jamie White in Austin, Texas, is reported in multiple sources. According to FOX 7 Austin, White was shot on March 10 while interrupting a vehicle burglary, and arrests were made ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)). KVUE also reports on the murder and arrests ([https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/jamie-white-murder-arrests-infowars/269-aa20c169-085c-4827-8e8c-ce8755a4b715](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/jamie-white-murder-arrests-infowars/269-aa20c169-085c-4827-8e8c-ce8755a4b715)).

ABC News reported that the shooting occurred on March 9, 2025 ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)). None of the sources mention a Ukrainian hit list. <image:7520>, <image:7521>, <image:7522>, <image:7523>, <image:7524>, <image:7532>


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Yahoo News article published on May 29, 2024, Alex Jones speculated that the killing of Infowars writer Jamie White in Austin, Texas, "could’ve been a hit" orchestrated by Ukraine. White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother's killing. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/alex-jones-blames-globalists-infowars-182655321.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alex-jones-blames-globalists-infowars-182655321.html)) <image:782>

The Latin Times reported that Jamie White was found dead in a parking lot in Austin, Texas, and that Alex Jones alleged White was on a Ukrainian hit list. White's social media accounts indicated that he himself believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. ([https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)) <image:785>, <image:786>, <image:787>, <image:788>, <image:789>, <image:790> The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" also discusses the murder of Jamie White and mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list.

## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list after being shot dead in Austin, Texas, is supported by some sources. Alex Jones and the Latin Times both mention this possibility. However, the evidence also shows that White's sister does not believe in a larger conspiracy.

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
. 

The Mueller probe catalyzed further inquires by House Democrats in Congress and continues to be mentioned in [discussions on the escalating Ukraine scandal](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/464845-house-lawyer-says-impeachment-probe-could-go-beyond-ukraine)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters published a fact-check article stating that the claim originated in a satirical article. The article quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving.” ([https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-check-article-saying-colin-kaepernick-has-threatened-to-leave-the-united-s-idUSKBN27I2D7/](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-check-article-saying-colin-kaepernick-has-threatened-to-leave-the-united-s-idUSKBN27I2D7/))

A Business Insider article discusses a Senate report stating that Russian trolls used the NFL kneeling debate and Colin Kaepernick to stoke racial divisions <image:2168>. Wired discusses Russian disinformation campaigns that amplified anti-Nike sentiment related to Kaepernick's protest. ([https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-trolls-used-colin-kaepernick-nfl-kneeling-debate-divide-2019-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-trolls-used-colin-kaepernick-nfl-kneeling-debate-divide-2019-10), [https://www.wired.com/story/nike-boycott-colin-kaepernick-russia-twitter/](https://www.wired.com/story/nike-boycott-colin-kaepernick-russia-twitter/))


## Elaboration
The claim is false. A Reuters fact-check article states that the claim originated in a satirical article, and a Kaepernick spokesman said that he "would never think about leaving" the United States ([https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-check-article-saying-colin-kaepernick-has-threatened-to-leave-the-united-s-idUSKBN27I2D7/](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-check-article-saying-colin-kaepernick-has-threatened-to-leave-the-united-s-idUSKBN27I2D7/)). The evidence also shows that Russian trolls used Kaepernick's actions to stoke racial divisions ([https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-trolls-used-colin-kaepernick-nfl-kneeling-debate-divide-2019-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-trolls-used-colin-kaepernick-nfl-kneeling-debate-divide-2019-10), [https://www.wired.com/story/nike-boycott-colin-kaepernick-russia-twitter/](https://www.wired.com/story/nike-boycott-colin-kaepernick-russia-twitter/)).


## Final Judgement
The claim that Colin Kaepernick said he would go to Russia if not properly respected in the United States is false. A Reuters fact-check article indicates the claim originated in a satirical article, and a Kaepernick spokesman stated he would not leave the U.S. Furthermore, evidence suggests Russian disinformation campaigns amplified the controversy surrounding Kaepernick's actions.

"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for," Netanyahu said.

Israel and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom Netanyahu says are still alive.

_Tel Aviv, Israel_ — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump sought to take a victory lap Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success. Trump seemed less certain of the chances of an imminent breakthrough.

Asked on Friday how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, he told reporters: "I'm very optimistic — but you know, look, it changes from day to day."

On Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectations, telling reporters that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.

Can Trump really take ownership of Gaza?

Live Reporting

Edited by Caitlin Wilson in Washington DC and Emily Atkinson in London

    North America correspondent
    
    One explanation for Donald Trump’s unexpected and expansive proposal for resolving the Gaza situation is that he is a second-term president and, like many of his predecessors, his thoughts are increasingly turning to how the history books will remember him.
    
    An area where presidents typically have broad authority, and can burnish their legacy, is foreign policy.
    
    With narrow majorities in Congress, any legislation Trump supports in the months ahead is going to face a tough road to passage – and will probably include sometimes unpleasant compromises.
    
    With each passing day, Trump’s domestic authority will diminish, as his own party begins to look toward first toward next year’s midterm congressional elections and, ultimately, to a new standard-bearer in the 2028 presidential contest.
    
    A dramatic foreign policy breakthrough, however, is something Trump and his White House team could seek on their own – akin to Ronald Reagan’s negotiations with the Soviets in his second term or Bill Clinton’s ill-fated Wye River meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat’s Palestinian Authority.
    
    The Middle East isn’t Trump’s only foreign policy interest – his ongoing ambitions for acquiring Greenland, for instance, signal an alternative avenue for legacy-building.
    
    But his successful brokering of the Abraham Accords at the end of his first term may give him reason to think he can pull off another diplomatic success in the region, even if his first steps in that direction this time around have already met stiff resistance.

    A little earlier, we heard from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who insists that Trump has "made it clear" that he will not be sending US troops to Gaza.
    
    When asked about American troops' involvement in Gaza during yesterday's daily press briefing, she said Trump had "not committed to putting boots on the ground".
    
    This lack of a definitive answer from Leavitt has changed today, following on from reiterations from both Trump and [Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that no US troops will be "on the ground"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et?post=asset%3A632187dc-187f-4ac2-bab1-d1509e7e38b4#post)

14. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, tells the BBC that the president's proposal to redevelop Gaza into the "Riviera of the Middle East" is "just isn't going to happen".
    
    He says the US role in such a plan would have to be between "slim and none" because "you can't put Americans in that kind of security environment without military protection and that just isn't going to happen".
    
    But he does suggest Palestinians in Gaza be offered resettlement.
    
    "Rebuilding a high-rise refugee camp is not an answer," he says, suggesting instead the possibility of "some kind of resettlement which would not be forcible but which would be consistent with international refugee doctrine".

    The order sets out: "The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant."
    
    The US "remains committed to accountability," it adds, as well as "international order".
    
    As a reminder, neither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in April 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Netanyahu to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The BBC mentions John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza, but it does not specify the destination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Netanyahu announced plans for the resettlement of Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CBS News ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) reports on a meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in April 2025, discussing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and ceasefire talks. <image:5555>, <image:5553> The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/07/trump-presidency-news/)) also discusses a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, mentioning the U.S. pushing for a ceasefire deal in Gaza. <image:k>

The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et)) reports on Benjamin Netanyahu meeting with US lawmakers at the Capitol. The BBC also mentions Donald Trump's plan for a US takeover of the Gaza Strip, and John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza. <image:5568>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in April 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Netanyahu to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The BBC mentions John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza, but it does not specify the destination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Netanyahu announced plans for the resettlement of Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says talks are underway with several countries about taking in Palestinians displaced by [the war in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/middleeast/anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera-reporter-intl)
.

The countries involved are South Sudan, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Libya, and Indonesia, a senior Israeli official told CNN. In exchange for taking in some of Gaza’s population of more than two million people, the official said the countries are looking for “significant financial and international compensation.”

On Wednesday, South Sudan rejected an [Associated Press report](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/middleeast/israel-in-talks-to-resettle-palestinians-from-gaza-in-south-sudan-ap-intl)
 that it was in discussions about the resettlement of Palestinians, saying in a statement the reports were “baseless and do not reflect the official position” of the country. Earlier this year, Somaliland also said there were no such talks.

And last week, Indonesia said it was ready to take in 2,000 Palestinians from Gaza for treatment but that they would return to Gaza once they recovered.

It’s unclear how advanced any of these discussions are and whether they are likely to come to fruition.

Netanyahu has never given a detailed vision of what will happen to Gaza after the war but has repeatedly advocated for resettling displaced Palestinians in other countries, particularly after President Donald Trump floated the idea early this year. It is also often used as a reference to Biblical Israel, which would include parts of today’s Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.

The comments were greeted by sharp statements from several Arab states, which condemned the use of the term as provocative and counterproductive to peace.

Egypt “demanded clarifications” on the use of the term, “given its implications of provoking instability and reflecting a rejection of the pursuit of peace in the region, as well as an insistence on escalation,” according to a foreign ministry statement.

Saudi Arabia said it “expresses its outright rejection of the settlement and expansionist plans adopted by the Israeli occupation authorities.”

Qatar said the use of the term is considered “an extension of the occupation’s approach based on arrogance, fuelling crises and conflicts, and blatantly infringing the sovereignty of states.”

Gal and Netanyahu’s conversation about “Greater Israel” did not appear on the official channel’s full interview, but a longer version with Netanyahu’s comments was posted on [Gal’s account on X](https://x.com/sharongal/status/1955343897963442437)

Ad Feedback But even as Trump appears to be cooling on the proposal, Israeli officials have embraced it.

In an interview published on Tuesday, Netanyahu said, “we are talking to several countries” without naming them.

Netanyahu claimed in the interview with Israeli network i24 that the plan was “not pushing out” Palestinians but would instead be “allowing them to leave.”

“All those who say they’re concerned for the Palestinians and want to help Palestinians,” Netanyahu said should “open their doors.”

“Why are they coming and preaching to us?! Open your doors,” he added.

The comments come as international alarm grows over Israel’s stated plan to take over Gaza City, home to more than one million Palestinians, including many already displaced by the war.

The densely populated city has continued to be hit by Israeli strikes with at least 123 people killed over the last 24 hours across Gaza, according to a tally on Wednesday from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

More than 100 humanitarian organisations meanwhile called on Israel to end what they called the weaponization of aid in Gaza, saying vital relief was not being allowed in while the territory is gripped by starvation.

Shaina Low, Communications Adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said any plans to relocate Palestinians, whether within Gaza or to foreign countries, was “a non-starter.”

“They aren’t acceptable under international law. And they should not be acceptable to the international community,” Low told CNN.

A ‘Greater Israel’
------------------

During the interview, Netanyahu was also asked by i24News network anchor Sharon Gal whether the prime minister “connects” to the vision of a “Greater Israel,” to which he responded, “Very much.”

The term “Greater Israel” refers to a state of Israel that is beyond the borders that exist today."

During yesterday’s [White House meeting](https://www.timesofisrael.com/blair-and-kushner-join-trumps-gaza-meet-official-calls-it-a-simple-policy-session/)
 on the future of Gaza, US President Donald Trump called Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer into the meeting while it was already in progress to set out Israel’s needs for the “day after” Hamas, Channel 12 reports.

Dermer, a top confidante of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Trump that Israel does not want to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip or deport Gaza’s residents, according to the report. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calls on the government to begin annexing parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas stands by its refusal to lay down its weapons.

The far-right minister, who has vocally opposed striking a deal with Hamas to end the nearly two-year war, presents his plan to “win in Gaza by the end of the year” at a press conference in Jerusalem.

Under Smotrich’s proposal, Hamas would be given an ultimatum to surrender, disarm and release the hostages still held in Gaza since the group’s October 2023 attack that triggered the war.

If Hamas refuses, Smotrich says Israel should annex a section of the territory each week for four weeks, bringing most of the Gaza Strip under full Israeli control.

According to Smotrich, Palestinians would first be told to move south in Gaza, followed by Israel imposing a siege on the territory’s north and center to defeat any remaining Hamas terrorists there, and ending with annexation.

“This can be achieved in three to four months,” he claims, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “to adopt this plan in full immediately.”

[![IDF troops operate in the Gaza Strip, in a photo cleared for publication, on August 28, 2025. Israel will continue to ensure that these gains are not eroded and that the security of the residents of the north is safeguarded,” he continues.

The Foreign Ministry adds that ahead of the Security Council discussion on UNIFIL, it “coordinated interagency preparations together with the IDF and the National Security Council,” and held talks with “key international partners,” in efforts it claims led to the decision to end UNIFIL’s mandate.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, celebrates the “good news” in a video message, saying UNIFIL “has failed in its mission and allowed Hezbollah to become the region’s most serious threat.”

“The Lebanese government now needs to take responsibility and ensure that no other force is present on its border with Israel,” he adds.

The mandate is set to formally expire in December 2026, with UNIFIL troops scheduled to withdraw from Lebanon during 2027.

While Israel had pushed for the observer force’s mandate to be terminated even sooner, arguing it had not sufficiently acted against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, its ally the US ultimately joined the rest of the Security Council in backing UNIFIL remaining in Lebanon for another year.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s defense attorneys in his corruption trial tell the Jerusalem District Court that they will not be able to continue to represent him if the court ramps up proceedings to four times a week, as it has demanded.

The Jerusalem District Court [judges announced](https://www.timesofisrael.com/court-says-netanyahu-to-testify-3-times-per-week-from-november-to-speed-up-trial/)
 earlier this month that four hearings per week will be held starting in November, and Netanyahu will testify in three of them until the end of his cross-examination, “in light of the current need to advance the trial.”

Chief defense attorney Amit Hadad tells the court that the decision will “severely harm” their ability to represent other clients and the “freedom of the defense team to practice,” threatening to resign if it moves ahead with the decision.

Hadad asks the court to schedule a hearing on the matter in the presence of Netanyahu.

Netanyahu’s trial on three charges of corruption has been ongoing since May 2020, with the prime minister’s testimony beginning in November 2024, although many hearings have been delayed and canceled due to his schedule.

The trial is expected to take at least another several years, though multiple unsuccessful efforts have been made to reach a plea deal that would end proceedings.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office denies as “fake news” a report by the Kan public broadcaster that Israel seriously considered ceding the Mount Dov area in exchange for Syria giving up its claim to the Golan Heights in security talks with Damascus weeks ago.

“The claim that Israel supposedly considered handing over Mount Dov is absolute fake news,” the PMO says in response to the report.

The report concerned the Mount Dov region, an area on the Golan’s border also known as the Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Israel, Lebanon and Syria.

According to Kan, Israel examined the possibility of transferring the area in return for Damascus suspending its sovereignty claim to the Golan, which Israel captured in the 1967 Six Day War and later annexed. (IDF)

Another accuser has come forward alleging sexual misconduct by International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan.

In a [report from](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/28/second-woman-accuses-icc-chief-prosecutor-karim-khan-of-sexual-misconduct)
 the Guardian, an unnamed woman who worked for Khan in 2009 said that he “behaved inappropriately, subjecting her to unwanted sexual advances, abused his authority over her, and repeatedly sought to pressure her into sexual activity.”

She described his behavior as a “constant onslaught” of advances.

Khan, who was responsible for pursuing ICC arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, temporarily stepped aside from his role earlier this year after other allegations emerged of sexual misconduct in the past two years.

His associates have tried to paint the allegations as a pro-Israel smear campaign, although the Guardian says there is “no evidence” of such a plot.

The protest is organized by an array of groups opposing antisemitism and bias in schools, including the New York City Public School Alliance, the Lawfare Project, EndJewHatred, Parents Against Antisemitism and SAFE Campus for Equality.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CBS News ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) reports on a meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in April 2025, discussing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and ceasefire talks. <image:5555>, <image:5553> The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/07/trump-presidency-news/)) also discusses a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, mentioning the U.S. pushing for a ceasefire deal in Gaza. <image:k>

The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et)) reports on Benjamin Netanyahu meeting with US lawmakers at the Capitol. The BBC also mentions Donald Trump's plan for a US takeover of the Gaza Strip, and John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza. <image:5568>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in April 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Netanyahu to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The BBC mentions John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza, but it does not specify the destination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Netanyahu announced plans for the resettlement of Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria.

================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

Meeting between US and Ukraine presidents descends into chaos at White House – here’s what they said, word for word

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Vance**: That’s exactly what you’re doing …

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

Ukraine ‘gambling with world war three’, Trump tells Zelenskyy in fiery meeting

Talks between US president and Ukrainian leader degenerate into shouting match before being cut short

*   [Live reaction to Zelenskyy’s clash with Trump and Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/01/live-european-leaders-rally-behind-zelenskyy-after-trump-vance-clash-updates)
    

US military support for Ukraine hangs in the balance and talks over a minerals deal have collapsed following a disastrous White House summit in which Donald Trump warned [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 that he was “gambling with world war three” and told the Ukrainian president to come back “when he is ready for peace”.

Zelenskyy left the White House early, and a press conference to announce the minerals deal was cancelled, after Trump gave Zelenskyy a dressing-down that followed an ambush led by vice-president JD Vance to shatter the fragile relationship between the two leaders.

The US president received the Ukrainian president on Friday to discuss a controversial mineral resources deal that Trump has said is the first step towards a ceasefire agreement he is seeking to broker between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

But the meeting on Friday degenerated after Zelenskyy suggested that Vance, a skeptic of US support for Ukraine, should come to the country to see the destruction from the invasion and that Russia was responsible for the continued fighting.

The meeting had been due to continue behind closed doors, but was cut short after the open display of antagonism in the Oval Office.

Soon afterwards, Trump released a statement in which he suggested that the two had not signed the minerals agreement.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” he said. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

During the public part of the meeting, Trump and Vance took turns to berate Zelenskyy, with Vance accusing him of carrying out “publicity tours” and Trump telling him: “You’re not really in a good position right now.”

At one point Vance demanded: “Have you said thank you once?”

Picking up the theme, Trump told Zelenskyy: “Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”

Trump then delivered Zelenskyy an ultimatum, telling him that Ukraine must either “make a deal or we are out” – suggesting the US could walk away from negotiations and cut off support to Kyiv more than three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

“Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.”

The French president, Emanuel Macron, told reporters: “Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people … These are simple things, but they’re good to remember at times like these.”

In a later interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy said the Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vance was “not good for both sides”. But he said Ukraine and Europe needed security guarantees from the US before entering peace talks.

Even if he gave the order to stop fighting, Zelenskyy said “nobody will just stop” because everyone is afraid “Putin will come back tomorrow”.

“We want just and lasting peace,” he added.

Despite the tense dialogue, the Ukrainian leader said he was hopeful that his relationship with Trump could still be salvaged and a minerals deal could move forward.

Before departing to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House that Zelenskyy was “looking for something that I’m not looking for” and again claimed that the Ukrainian leader wanted to “fight, fight, fight”.

“Either we’re going to end it or let him fight it out, and if he fights it out, it’s not going to be pretty because without us, he doesn’t win,” Trump said.

The personal relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy has been strained since Trump’s previous administration, when he was impeached – though not convicted and removed from office – on the grounds that he had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate business dealings involving Joe Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine.

But Friday marked a true low point in the relationship, with the public blow-up coming as Ukraine is desperate for foreign military aid and international support to keep the country afloat amid its grinding defense from the Russian invasion.

The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser described it as “the most shocking behavior by Trump and Vance I’ve ever seen in the Oval Office. An ambush.”

Zelenskyy arrived in Washington on Friday after several weeks of tense negotiations in which he alleged that the US was pressuring him to sign a deal that it would take “10 generations to pay back”.

Trump has said that he wants the US to be repaid for providing military aid to Ukraine, but commentators have suggested that the deal looks more like a shakedown at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.

The deal would provide a general framework for a joint investment fund that will take in revenues from the sale of Ukrainian deposits of graphite, lithium, rare earth metals, and oil and gas. But many of those resources are in areas close to the frontlines, and it is unlikely to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars that the US says it wants to recoup from its military aid to Ukraine.

Neither does it contain specific security guarantees that Ukrainian officials have sought during the negotiations, which have gone back and forth since the deal was first proposed by the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, during a visit to Kyiv earlier this month.

During a meeting with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Thursday, Trump had suggested that the American workers sent to mine Ukraine’s natural resources could serve as a “backstop”, a deterrent to further Russian aggression if a deal is made.

Even as Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, Trump sought to physically dominate the Ukrainian leader, telling reporters that Zelenskyy, who was wearing a black turtleneck, was “all dressed up”. “Our discussions focused on the continued military assistance for Ukraine, relevant legislative initiatives, my meeting with President Trump, efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace, our vision for ending the war, and the importance of robust security guarantees.”

Trump ended the meeting by saying that Zelenskyy was not “acting thankful” and “that’s not a nice thing”.

“This is going to be great television,” he concluded.

Interviewed by CNN after the stunning blowup, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, questioned whether Zelenskyy really wanted peace, and said the Ukrainian leader should apologise after the meeting devolved into what he described as a “fiasco”.

“There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,” Rubio told CNN.

“When you start talking about that aggressively – and the president is a deal-maker, he made deals his entire life – you’re not going to get people to the table,” he said. He says he does, but maybe he doesn’t.”

Russian officials reacted with glee to the extraordinary scenes at the White House, while Ukraine’s European allies expressed support for Kyiv.

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president, said Zelenskiy had got a “solid slap” from Trump in what he described as “a brutal dressing-down in the Oval Office”.

The European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Europe would step up its support for Ukraine “so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor.” In an indirect rebuke to Trump, she said: “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. Asked to respond to Trump’s claim that Zelenskyy was not interested in peace, he said nobody wanted the three-year war to end more than Ukrainians."

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the [Oval Office blowup](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-security-guarantees-trump-meeting-washington-eebdf97b663c2cdc9e51fa346b09591d)
 with U.S. counterpart Donald Trump last week was “regrettable,” adding that he stands ready to work under Trump’s “strong leadership” to get a lasting peace.

Zelenskyy’s remarks — an apparent attempt to placate Trump — came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a [pause in military aid](https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-a15a459c9a3a393d040478ebbe250a9e)

AP AUDIO: Zelenskyy calls Oval Office spat with Trump ‘regrettable,’ says he’s ready to work for Ukraine peace

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling last week’s Oval Office spat ‘regrettable.’

“Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position from one another. Trump said during his [address to Congress late Tuesday](https://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-congress-immigration-tariffs-guests-93f6107ede260854f90c65c4bde60de8)
 that he received a letter from Zelenskyy saying as much and that it noted Kyiv valued “how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence.”

“I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago,” Trump said. “Simultaneously, we’ve had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.”

Earlier, in an apparent reference to Trump’s criticism following the contentious White House meeting Friday that Zelenskyy does not want a peace deal, the Ukrainian leader said, “None of us want an endless war.”

“Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,” he said.

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

In a wide-ranging conversation on [Theo Von's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

Content: "Greene's trades have often drawn red flags due to her committee roles and the timing of the trades.

Musk's comments on Congressional wealth comes after former President **Joe Biden** supported a ban on Congress trading last year.

"Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they're in the Congress," Biden said in an interview.

Biden said he was able to live on a Congressional salary and not worry about becoming rich through playing the stock market previously.

Representative **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) [previously told Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/05/39096827/exclusive-khanna-says-shameful-congress-members-profited-from-stocks-calls-for-trading-ban-makin?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 that he will continue to advocate for a vote to ban the practice.

“We should have a vote on it,” Khanna told Benzinga.

Khanna said that despite his continued speeches in the House advocating for a ban on stock trading, there is a “collective shrug” in Congress regarding the issue.

"It is shameful that over three years after the pandemic with the shenanigans from those senators who sold their stock after learning of the pandemic" there still hasn't been a vote, Khanna said.

Khanna said that people were outraged at the time when several senators sold their stocks in tourism and other sectors that would be hurt, knowing that the economy could crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Senators making money when the rest of the country was suffering during the pandemic."

Unusual Whales helped [launch two Congress Trading themed ETFs](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/penny-stocks/23/02/30768851/want-to-copy-master-trader-nancy-pelosis-investments-theres-an-etf-for-that-here-are-the-hol?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 in 2023 through a collaboration with Subversive. Does anyone know?" Musk tweeted.

The quoted tweet included the following members of Congress:

*   **Nancy Pelosi** (D-Calif.): Annual salary $223,000, Net worth $202 million
    
*   **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.): Annual salary $200,000, Net worth $95 million
    
*   **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.): Annual salary $210,000, Net worth $75 million
    
*   **Elizabeth Warren** (D-Mass.): Annual salary: $285,000, Net worth $67 million
    

The replies included a post from the original poster with additional examples of politicians who have net worths of more than $50 million.

"I am not suggesting anything. While the former speaker of the house has been accused of providing insider information to her husband in the past, her husband makes investments as part of his career.

People in the comments were quick to point out inaccuracies in the net worth amounts with Warren estimated to be worth significantly less than this amount.

Story Continues

**Why It's Important:** Musk's post took aim at members of Congress regardless of their political party.

In comments made alongside **Donald Trump,** Musk said he questions how members of Congress are getting significantly wealthier while in office, while joking that maybe they're just good at investing.

"I think the reality is they're getting wealthier to taxpayer expense," Musk said.

An investigation into members of Congress and their investing activity and payments made by special interest groups while in office could reveal that members of both the Republican and Democratic parties made questionable moves to help boost their wealth.

This could be an interesting move by Musk, who is currently aligned with the Republican party and has the support of many Republican members of Congress.

The Unusual Whales congressional trading report for 2024 showed that Democrats averaged a 31.1% return in 2024 and Republicans averaged a 26.1% return versus the S&P 500 at 24.9%.

The top 10 traders in 2024 list was made up of six Republicans and four Democrats with five Congress members having returns of more than 100% in 2024.

Of the individuals listed in Musk's quoted tweet above, Pelosi ranked 10th in 2024 at +70.9%. Oops, something went wrong

Billionaire **Elon Musk** targeted members of Congress who enjoy rising wealth amounts while in office, which comes as retail traders place larger emphasis on politicians’ [stock and options trading activity.](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/congress-trading?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)

**What Happened:** Members of Congress can buy and sell stocks, options and cryptocurrency as long as they disclose the transactions in a timely manner.

This activity has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years as trades made by members of Congress often appear to be conflicts of interest based on non-public knowledge and can sometimes be stocks related to government-funded contracts.

     **Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.**
    

A post that discussed several prominent members of Congress with their annual salaries and net worths caught the attention of Musk, who is currently the world's richest person worth $379 billion.

"It's not like these politicians started companies or were NBA All-Stars, so where did they get all the money? Make your own conclusions," the poster tweeted.

The annual salaries in the post could include other sources of income and may not be strictly their Congressional salary.

The post also doesn't take into account how much the net worth of members of Congress was before they took office or what their spouses do.

Pelosi's husband **Paul Pelosi** is a venture capitalist who regularly buys and sells technology stocks. McConnell ranked 21st at +42.4%.

Financial disclosures show that Pelosi has millions of dollars in real estate investments, business partnerships and stock holdings.

A Napa, California, home and vineyard the California Democrat owns is worth between $5 million and $25 million and generated between $100,001 and $1 million in income from grape sales, according to her 2019 report.

The couple also own several commercial properties that generate rental income in that same range and hold investments in undeveloped real estate.

While assets listed on the form total between $57 million and $271 million, liabilities range from $20 million to $97 million. Liabilities include multimillion-dollar mortgages on several properties and equity credit lines.

Pelosi’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The claim: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has amassed more than $196 million in wealth working on a congressional salary of $193,400
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the richest members of Congress, but a social media post circulating about the wealth she has built while earning a congressional salary is wrong about her net worth.

The post claims Pelosi has been in office for 28 years, during which she earned $193,400 per year. <image:1238>

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021, in Washington.

Fact check: No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't worth $196 million

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. That’s about $90 million less than the figure cited in the meme.

Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987, when [members were paid $89,500.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1011.pdf)
 Today, as [speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500.](https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries)
 As minority leader, Pelosi would have earned the $193,400 spelled out in the meme.

But her salary from a 34-year career in Congress, including 18 years as minority leader and speaker, doesn’t tell the whole story about the personal wealth she and her husband have built.

[Two polls](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/post-debate-polls-bad-news-biden-00166395)
 out on July 3, 2024 – both taken after last Thursday’s presidential debate – show that more voters are now supporting former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden. Biden, 81, [is the first octogenarian to occupy](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html)
 the Oval Office – and his main rival, former President Donald Trump, is 78.

I [first wrote about most](https://theconversation.com/why-are-us-politicians-so-old-and-why-do-they-want-to-stay-in-office-217024)
 voters’ concerns about the presidential candidates’ ages in the fall of 2023 – and since then, those concerns have only grown. It’s a bipartisan trend: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, is 72, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is 81. Bernie Sanders is 81 and hasn’t mentioned retirement at all.

In the House, California Democrat and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at age 84, is running for reelection for her 19th [full term in office](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosi-seek-re-election-reversing-earlier-plan-2022-01-25/)
. Mitch McConnell appeared to freeze while speaking with the media, raising questions about his age and health. The news comes amid a [barrage of media reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/democrats-biden-debate-fallout-00166208)
 that leading Democrats are questioning Biden’s abilities and stamina because of his age. In February, special counsel Robert Hur [declined to charge Biden with mishandling classified](https://apnews.com/article/biden-memory-age-special-counsel-report-doj-f4232bc8316e556ed467185b67c3e0a8)
 documents because he presents as an “elderly man with a poor memory,” he wrote. The report caused outrage among some Democrats at the time.

A [Gallup Poll released in June 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx)
 found that about 67% of Americans say Biden is too old to be president."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Yahoo Finance article discusses Elon Musk's questioning of the wealth of members of Congress, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Elizabeth Warren. The article mentions their annual salaries and net worths. The article was published on February 13, 2025, by Benzinga. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-questions-congress-members-190016734.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-questions-congress-members-190016734.html)) <image:1230>

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Yahoo Finance article discusses Elon Musk's questioning of the wealth of members of Congress, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Elizabeth Warren. The article mentions their annual salaries and net worths. The article was published on February 13, 2025, by Benzinga. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-questions-congress-members-190016734.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-questions-congress-members-190016734.html)) <image:1230>

The Yahoo News article discusses the wealth of Nancy Pelosi, mentioning her real estate investments, business partnerships, and stock holdings. It states that Pelosi's assets total between $57 million and $271 million, with liabilities ranging from $20 million to $97 million. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-house-speaker-172533305.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-house-speaker-172533305.html)) <image:1239>, <image:1241>, <image:1238>, <image:1240> The Conversation published an article on July 21, 2023, discussing the age of US politicians, including Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. <image:1243>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results provide information on the net worth of US politicians. Quiverquant.com offers a live net worth tracker for members of Congress, using data on politicians' stock portfolios ([https://www.quiverquant.com/congress-live-net-worth/](https://www.quiverquant.com/congress-live-net-worth/)). Wikipedia lists the wealthiest members of Congress as of 2018, with figures that are estimates, and the original documents are available on OpenSecrets ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth)).

OpenSecrets also provides information on the personal finances of members of Congress, including their estimated wealth, and has a section on the richest members of Congress in 2018 ([https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances)). The image <image:18> shows a list of politicians with their wealth.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information on the net worth of several US politicians, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitch McConnell. The claim states that the image shows a list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the list was released by Ukraine or that it represents bribes. The evidence only provides information on the net worth of the politicians.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention any bribes or a list released by Ukraine. The evidence does provide information on the net worth of the politicians listed in the image.

To verify the claim, information is missing about the source of the list and the context of the figures presented.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Yahoo Finance article discusses Elon Musk's questioning of the wealth of members of Congress, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Elizabeth Warren. The article mentions their annual salaries and net worths. The article was published on February 13, 2025, by Benzinga. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-questions-congress-members-190016734.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-questions-congress-members-190016734.html)) <image:1230>

The Yahoo News article discusses the wealth of Nancy Pelosi, mentioning her real estate investments, business partnerships, and stock holdings. It states that Pelosi's assets total between $57 million and $271 million, with liabilities ranging from $20 million to $97 million. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-house-speaker-172533305.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-house-speaker-172533305.html)) <image:1239>, <image:1241>, <image:1238>, <image:1240> The Conversation published an article on July 21, 2023, discussing the age of US politicians, including Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. <image:1243>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results provide information on the net worth of US politicians. Quiverquant.com offers a live net worth tracker for members of Congress, using data on politicians' stock portfolios ([https://www.quiverquant.com/congress-live-net-worth/](https://www.quiverquant.com/congress-live-net-worth/)). Wikipedia lists the wealthiest members of Congress as of 2018, with figures that are estimates, and the original documents are available on OpenSecrets ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth)).

The image <image:18> shows a list of politicians with their wealth.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information on the net worth of several US politicians, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitch McConnell. The claim states that the image shows a list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the list was released by Ukraine or that it represents bribes. The evidence only provides information on the net worth of the politicians.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention any bribes or a list released by Ukraine. The evidence does provide information on the net worth of the politicians listed in the image.

To verify the claim, information is missing about the source of the list and the context of the figures presented.

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that there were claims of Russia offering sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The evidence mentions Maria Zakharova's comments and the spread of wildfires in Los Angeles County starting January 7, 2025. It also mentions that Russia used the Los Angeles wildfires to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda.

Therefore, the claim is neither confirmed nor refuted, as the evidence does not provide direct information about Russia offering assistance.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Now, NPR has learned that Russia is using the fires to advance anti-Ukraine propaganda as part of its war against that country. So far, there's no evidence that it happened, and the Ukrainian government has denied it to NPR, but researchers say that it is part of a bigger narrative that Russia has pushed for years. Pro-Russian accounts regularly claim that various Ukrainian officials own luxury goods overseas, like yachts, villas and, in one case, a sports car. The underlying idea is that Ukrainian government is corrupt and does not deserve foreign aid, which it is currently receiving for its war with Russia. How did it spread?

HUO: So fact-checkers traced this narrative to pro-Russian Telegram channels. A lot of these accounts and websites have a history of either being a part of or echoing known Russian-influenced operations. Darren Linvill is a professor at Clemson University and codirects its media forensics lab.

DARREN LINVILL: It's just so typical of what we see from Russia and so despicable to take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends.

HUO: You know, aside from undermining Ukraine, Russia also wants to sow internal discord in the United States. We see this both in this disaster and in the Maui fires in 2023.

KELLY: Yeah.

HUO: Russian state media amplified American - often conservative - voices criticizing the government's disaster response. This didn't get much traction, though.

KELLY: And this specific false claim - has it gotten much traction - traveled very far?

HUO: So it's gotten a million views on X with help from one pro-Russian influencer and then an American influencer."

Jan. "It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The story that initially circulated was debunked by professional fact checkers from [Greece](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and the [United States](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
. The influencers have said they did not know the company paying them was linked to Russia.

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government’s response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab told NPR in an email. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts have spread baseless claims that Ukrainian military officials owned mansions that were destroyed in the fires that swept the Los Angeles region.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts and outlets have been spreading a [baseless narrative](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
 that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down [in the Los Angeles wildfires](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)
. Researchers who study Russian influence operations say it is part of the Kremlin’s larger campaign to discredit the Ukrainian government and [undermine U.S. support for Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)
.

“It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves.” Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

“It’s just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends,” said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Within hours, it was amplified by several other sources, including another Telegram channel which labeled it as satire, an X account, and a website that resembles a [pro-Russian network](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20240212_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_PORTAL-KOMBAT-NETWORK_ENG_VF.pdf)
 that French authorities previously identified. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council’s Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as “Russian propaganda.” It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The Ukrainian government denied to NPR that any general’s homes were affected by the fire.

The next day, an influencer using the handle @OlgaBazova, who has previously echoed narratives pushed by known Russian influence networks, [shared the story](https://archive.ph/wZHZb)
 in English with its 700,000 followers on X. The account’s bio describes itself as “specializing in humoristic geopolitical analytics, exposing hypocrisy and satire.”

Later in the evening, Robert “Buzz” Patterson, an American conservative influencer with 400,000 followers on X, [repeated the claim](https://archive.ph/2BL9c)
, seemingly without irony, in a post that has been viewed over a million times, according to X’s data.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:

[Become a Sponsor](https://www.opb.org/sponsorship/)

When contacted by NPR on X about the post, @OlgaBazova responded with a link to a Russian-language article that cited the original Telegram claim about the mansions.

Patterson did not respond to messages from NPR asking why he had posted the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency reported on January 12, 2025, on Russia's comments regarding the California wildfires, mentioning Maria Zakharova's comments and the spread of wildfires in Los Angeles County starting January 7. The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims, specifically those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022. NPR reported on January 16, 2025, on how Russia used the Los Angeles wildfires to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. <image:4830>, <image:4831>, <image:4838>, <image:4849>, <image:4853>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that there were claims of Russia offering sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The evidence mentions Maria Zakharova's comments and the spread of wildfires in Los Angeles County starting January 7, 2025. It also mentions that Russia used the Los Angeles wildfires to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda.

Therefore, the claim is neither confirmed nor refuted, as the evidence does not provide direct information about Russia offering assistance.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread false claims about Ukrainian officials' mansions burning down in Los Angeles. The story was debunked by fact-checkers.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires. The NPR and OPB reports focus on Russia's propaganda efforts, not on offers of assistance.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence does not provide information about Russia offering assistance.

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

NPR reported on January 16, 2025, on how Russia used the Los Angeles wildfires to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. <image:4830>, <image:4831>, <image:4838>, <image:4849>, <image:4853>

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case), [https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/), and [https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that there were claims of Russia offering sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The evidence mentions Maria Zakharova's comments and the spread of wildfires in Los Angeles County starting January 7, 2025. It also mentions that Russia used the Los Angeles wildfires to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda.

Therefore, the claim is neither confirmed nor refuted, as the evidence does not provide direct information about Russia offering assistance.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR ([https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5259842](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5259842)) and OPB ([https://www.opb.org/article/2025/01/16/russia-tries-to-use-california-fires-to-discredit-ukraine/](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/01/16/russia-tries-to-use-california-fires-to-discredit-ukraine/)) reported on January 16, 2025, that Russia used the California wildfires to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread false claims about Ukrainian officials' mansions burning down in Los Angeles. The story was debunked by fact-checkers.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires. The NPR and OPB reports focus on Russia's propaganda efforts, not on offers of assistance.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence does not provide information about Russia offering assistance.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.gmfus.org/news/inflaming-divides-russian-narratives-california-wildfires): 
Content: The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMFUS) published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing how Russian narratives on the California wildfires were used to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine. The article mentions that Russian government officials and state-affiliated media criticized the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders, mocked emergency relief payments, and amplified misleading information, including AI-generated content. The article also mentions that Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to spread propaganda. The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMFUS) published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing how Russian narratives on the California wildfires were used to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires. The focus is on Russia's propaganda efforts and criticism of the US government.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence does not provide information about Russia offering assistance.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to spread propaganda, but there is no evidence to confirm that Russia offered assistance. The focus of the reports is on Russia's propaganda efforts and criticism of the US government.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to spread propaganda, there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. Multiple sources, including NPR and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, highlight Russia's efforts to exploit the situation for propaganda purposes, but do not mention any offers of aid.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to several committees, including the Finance Committee, and the House Committee on the Judiciary. John Thune was assigned to committees such as the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The evidence does not explicitly state that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether John Thune had the power to block Adam Schiff's assignments and whether he did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

A document lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress. John Thune is listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Finance Committee. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. [Source](https://torreydc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate-Committee-Assignments_119-Congress_Printable.pdf) Another document lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and John Thune is listed as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. [Source](https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/files/insights/eyes/2023/02/118thcongresscommitteeassignments.pdf)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to several committees, including the Finance Committee, and the House Committee on the Judiciary. John Thune was assigned to committees such as the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The evidence does not explicitly state that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether John Thune had the power to block Adam Schiff's assignments and whether he did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

Senate Judiciary Committee member Adam Schiff (D- CA) announced on Tuesday his intention to place a hold on the nomination of President Donald Trump’s nominee for D.C. It sure looks like a Gestapo tactic.
    
    Definitely not American.

Content: "Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff, the former chairman of the panel.

The decision reflects the increasingly politicized nature of one of Congress’ most important national security committees and was swiftly met with outrage by the two California Democrats, both of whom played key roles in the impeachments of former President Donald Trump.

“I cannot put partisan loyalty ahead of national security, and I cannot simply recognize years of service as the sole criteria for membership on this essential committee. Integrity matters more,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that he [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154?s=20&t=d-aUU6NhKX5LawVEJvU2nA)
 Tuesday night.

McCarthy has cited a “new standard” from Democrats for why he would strip Schiff and Swalwell, both of California, of their committee assignments. [](#maincontent)

![A federal appeals court based in Washington, DC has struck down President Trump’s tariff policy saying that he unlawfully leaned on emergency powers to impose tariffs. “It’s too bad because that committee has always been a bipartisan committee, and he’s taking one of the most precious pieces of glassware in the congressional cabinet and smashing it, and the damage is going to be irreparable.”

He added that “if a Democrat advocated for violence against another member of Congress, I would support getting rid of them.”

Schiff told reporters that “if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from vigorously pushing back against his efforts to tear down these institutions, he’s going to find out just how wrong he is.”

“I think this is a terrible move on his part and once again, showing McCarthy just catering to the most extreme elements of this conference,” he added.

Schiff will sit on the Judiciary Committee, according to a Democratic aide, while Swalwell told CNN he will sit on the Judiciary and Homeland Security panels.

Some House Republicans have criticized McCarthy’s move ejecting Democrats from the intelligence panel. Indeed, the opposition to it is bipartisan.”

The three Democrats whom McCarthy ousted or plan to oust stood in unity at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday.

“The three of us have chosen to stick together because this isn’t about any individual committee assignments, and this is about an institution where the speaker of the House is using his power to go after his political opponents, and to pick them off the field,” Swalwell said.

They all seemed in agreement that the “destructive move” was especially hypocritical, given embattled Rep. He’s perfectly comfortable with it,” Schiff said.

Members appointed to select subcommittees

McCarthy on Tuesday also announced the list of GOP members he is appointing to serve on the select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government, with Ohio GOP Rep.

In the letter, McCarthy added that “it is my assessment that the misuse of this panel during the 116th and 117th Congresses severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions – ultimately leaving our nation less safe,” and that he wants the panel to be one of “genuine honesty and credibility that regains the trust of the American people.”

‘Political vengeance’
---------------------

“It’s political vengeance,” Swalwell said following the decision on Tuesday. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said in a statement that she opposes the push to remove the Democrats.

“I appreciate these Republican members speaking out against what McCarthy is doing,” Schiff later told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.”

“I think it does show that there are Republicans who understand this is very ill considered."

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to several committees, including the Finance Committee, and the House Committee on the Judiciary. John Thune was assigned to committees such as the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The evidence does not explicitly state that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether John Thune had the power to block Adam Schiff's assignments and whether he did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

Content: "Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell accused House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of "political vengeance" for blocking the California Democrats from serving on the House Intelligence Committee.

"This is, I think, not an unexpected but nonetheless, destructive move by Kevin McCarthy," Schiff said during a press conference Wednesday morning.

McCarthy rejected a request from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to keep Schiff and Swalwell on the committee. Dems say the move is nothing more than political retribution.**

The move comes as the new Republican majority is outlining its plans and priorities for the session, which include a focus on oversight and investigations of President Biden's administration.

As House speaker, McCarthy has authority to approve or reject spots on the intelligence committee because it is a "select" committee, while positions on standing committees ultimately require a vote of the House. 6 attack on the Capitol.

In [a letter to Jeffries](https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154)
, McCarthy said the intel committee under Schiff "severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions — ultimately leaving our nation less safe."

### Schiff told reporters Tuesday he thinks the move is purely political

While McCarthy argues blocking Schiff and Swalwell is in the interest of national security, Democrats say the move is nothing more than political retribution.

"His objection seems to be that I was the lead impeachment manager in Donald Trump's first impeachment, and that we held him accountable for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid from Ukraine," Schiff said. "So he is now, I think, carrying the dirty water for the former president in trying to remove me from the intel committee."

But, Schiff added, "if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from holding him accountable, holding Donald Trump accountable or any of the extreme elements of his conference, he's wrong."

Schiff is now slated to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, according to a source familiar with the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly.

Schiff, the former Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment trial, has long been a top Republican political target. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, removed a provision that could have fined Schiff $16 million if the House Ethics Committee determined he lied. Both investigations concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential election but neither found evidence of a criminal conspiracy.

“Representative Schiff purposely deceived his Committee, Congress, and the American people,” the resolution said.

The House has only censured two other lawmakers in the last 20 years. But the GOP resolution would also launch an ethics investigation into Schiff’s conduct.

While Schiff did not initiate the 2017 congressional investigation into Trump’s Russia ties — then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican who later became one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, started it — Republicans arguing in favor of his censure Wednesday blamed him for what they said was the fallout of that probe, and of the separate investigation started that same year by Trump’s own Justice Department.

Luna said that Schiff’s comments that there was evidence against Trump “ripped apart American families across the country” and that he was “permanently destroying family relationships.” Several blamed him for the more than $30 million spent by then-special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the Justice Department probe.

Schiff said the censure resolution “would accuse me of omnipotence, the leader of some a vast Deep State conspiracy, and of course, it is nonsense.”

Democrats aggressively defended their colleague. Adam Schiff calls Trump’s election lie a ‘dangerous cancer’](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-rep-adam-schiff-calls-trumps-election-lie-a-dangerous-cancer)

Mueller, who led the two-year Justice Department investigation, determined that Russia intervened on the campaign’s behalf and that Trump’s campaign welcomed the help. Schiff was the lead House prosecutor making the case for conviction to the Senate, arguing repeatedly that “right matters.” The Republican-led chamber ultimately acquitted him.

[**WATCH:** McCarthy says he’ll block Schiff, Swalwell from House intelligence committee](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-mccarthy-says-hell-block-schiff-swalwell-from-house-intelligence-committee)

Trump was impeached a second time a year later, after he had left office, for his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. The Senate again acquitted Trump.

In the censure resolution against Schiff, Luna also cited a report released in May from special counsel John Durham that found that the FBI rushed into its investigation of Trump’s campaign and relied too much on raw and unconfirmed intelligence.

Durham — who testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday — said investigators repeatedly relied on “confirmation bias,” ignoring or rationalizing away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward.

The CNN article from January 25, 2023, reports that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy denied Adam Schiff a seat on the House Intelligence Committee, citing the misuse of the panel during the 116th and 117th Congresses as the reason. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5> The NPR article also reports that McCarthy blocked Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee, stating that Schiff's actions undermined national security. <image:7861> Schiff stated that McCarthy's actions were political retribution for Schiff's role in the impeachment of Donald Trump. The PBS article discusses a censure resolution against Adam Schiff for comments he made about investigations into Donald Trump’s ties to Russia and mentions that McCarthy said he would block Schiff from the House intelligence committee.

The provided sources do not mention John Thune.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee.

* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress and mentions that Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee. <image:2574> The document also provides links to the full lists of Republican and Democrat appointments. [Source](https://www.acec.org/news/last-word-blog/post/senate-leaders-finalize-committee-assignments-for-the-119th-congress/)

A document lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress. John Thune is listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Finance Committee. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. [Source](https://torreydc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate-Committee-Assignments_119-Congress_Printable.pdf) Another document lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and John Thune is listed as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. [Source](https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/files/insights/eyes/2023/02/118thcongresscommitteeassignments.pdf)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to several committees, including the Finance Committee, and the House Committee on the Judiciary. John Thune was assigned to committees such as the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The evidence does not explicitly state that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether John Thune had the power to block Adam Schiff's assignments and whether he did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

Intelligence about the depot's munitions, its vulnerabilities, and nearby Russian defensive systems was provided to Ukraine by the [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
. The depot reportedly stored not only artillery shells, but also [Iskander](/wiki/Iskander "Iskander")
 missiles, [Tochka-U](/wiki/Tochka-U "Tochka-U")
 ballistic missiles and [glide bombs](/wiki/Glide_bomb "Glide bomb")
 and it is unclear if his [bomb damage assessment](/wiki/Bomb_damage_assessment "Bomb damage assessment")
 includes both missiles and artillery ammunition.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

Ukrainian drones strike a major military depot in a Russian town northwest of Moscow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ![This combo picture shows two satellite images of an ammunition depot in Toropets, Russia, on Saturday Sept. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

 and Russian reserves were rushed to the area.[\[40\]](#cite_note-BBC_Cursino-42)
 By the end of the first week, the Ukrainian military said it had captured 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi) of Russian territory, while Russian authorities acknowledged that Ukraine had captured 28 settlements.[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)

In the second half of August the front stabilized,[\[42\]](#cite_note-forbes_20240911-44)
 and in early October, the Ukrainian advance had stalled.[\[11\]](#cite_note-CNN_Third_Month-12)
 From November, North Korean forces were sent to the province to support the Russian military. By the end of August, the operation began to be criticized for diverting Ukrainian forces from [the east](/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine_campaign "Eastern Ukraine campaign")

 According to Andrzej Wilk of the [Centre for Eastern Studies](/wiki/Centre_for_Eastern_Studies "Centre for Eastern Studies")

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct.

 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")

 Russian foreign ministry spokesperson [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")

[\[397\]](#cite_note-399)
 A Russian academic with close ties to senior Russian diplomats said that Putin probably lost interest in further talks in Qatar because the "Russian leadership usually does not make any compromises under pressure" and attacks on energy infrastructure are highly effective tactics that do more damage to Ukraine than to Russia, adding that Russia is more interested in talks with Ukraine about a broader ceasefire.[\[306\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-308)

Local Telegram channels are filled with offers of free accommodation in various Russian cities, and the government has offered evacuees a one-time payment of 10,000 roubles (just over $100) as compensation although there may be additional payments, for example 600,000 roubles ($6,500) in case of serious injury.

“The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response, and all the goals facing us will undoubtedly be achieved,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, ordering security services to conduct a “counterterrorist operation” in the region.

‘A strong move’
---------------

The Russian media, which is largely aligned with the Kremlin, has grudgingly acknowledged the Ukrainians’ success.

“The Zelenskyy regime has made a strong move – with all the resulting not-very-pleasant conclusions and consequences for our side,” columnist Mikhail Rostovsky wrote for the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“If you are dealing with a strong adversary (and no sane person has long doubted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are a strong and highly motivated adversary for Russia), you must be prepared for the fact that from time to time they will make strong and unexpected moves that will catch you off-guard.”

These successes were not lost on the exiled opposition.

Politician Leonid Gozman praised the Ukrainian troops.

“The actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces speak not only of their high professionalism, but also of the creativity of the Ukrainian leadership,” Gozman wrote in Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper that often takes aim at the Kremlin.

“Someone said to them: ‘Why not?’ and they did what no one expected of them, completely changing the picture of the war. We have enough unused reserves.”

Alexey Malinin, founder of the Center for International Interaction and Cooperation, told Al Jazeera that from the Russian perspective, the invasion of Kursk is counterproductive to peace talks.

“The incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region shows that Ukraine aims to strengthen its negotiating position,” he said.

“However, this act does nothing to bring the negotiation process nearer. As President Zelenskyy rightly noted, the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise.”

Gozman noted that Russian citizens have not yet resisted the Ukrainians en masse and disparaged Russia’s defence capabilities.

“Just as during the days of \[Yevgeny\] Prigozhin’s rebellion it suddenly became clear that the various Russian Guards were only good at fighting peaceful demonstrators, and did not want to go up against armed bandits,” he said, referring to the late leader of the Wagner Group mercenary force.

“So now it turned out that the border guards were not capable of confronting a real threat (and it was not their fault, they were designed for something else), that the formidable Chechen troops had missed the enemy for the umpteenth time, otherwise they would have certainly routed him, but it did not happen, and most importantly, our generals are good at attacking other countries, but not at defending their own.”

Pro-Kremlin Russian media have repeatedly accused the Ukrainian army of targeting civilians, including a drone strike on an ambulance that killed its driver and one paramedic and wounded another.

There have also been reports that Ukrainian soldiers opened fire on cars in the village of Kurilovka, fatally wounding a pregnant woman, and took captive volunteers who were helping evacuate civilians.

On his talk show on Rossiya-1, Putin-friendly TV host Vladimir Solovyov accused Ukraine’s Western backers of masterminding the incursion.

“What we’re witnessing is an unprecedented escalation,” he told viewers.

“Western countries are sincerely attempting to say, ‘We weren’t involved. The second probable goal is an attempt to stake out a foothold in the territory of Kursk Oblast for subsequent bargaining in these or other negotiations. Ukraine won’t improve its negotiating position, only, at best, delay the discussion of a peaceful resolution, but the final scenario can be much worse for the Ukraine.”

Malinin added that after the Kursk situation is resolved, the Russian military will retaliate with an “intensive offensive”.

Content: "Ukraine may be able to do so if Western support continues to empower Ukrainian innovation.

**The Russian military command has gathered around 78,000 troops, including 11,000 North Koreans, in an attempt to expel Ukrainian forces from positions in Kursk Oblast over the last six months.** An estimated 11,000 Ukrainian forces advanced into Kursk Oblast in early August 2024, seizing the tactical initiative and complicating the Russian military's Fall 2024 offensive effort.\[1\] Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly delayed his deadlines for Russian forces to push Ukrainian troops from Kursk Oblast first by mid-October 2024 then by January 2025 and repeatedly prioritized Russian advances in Donetsk Oblast over regaining control of the Kursk salient, which Russian forces still had not done at the end of January 2025.\[2\] Putin has not been able fully to insulate Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast from the theater-wide impacts of the incursion, however, and the Russian military has simultaneously been pulling troops, armored vehicles, and artillery and air defense systems away from other sectors in Ukraine to reinforce the Russian force grouping fighting in Kursk Oblast. The Kremlin has failed to prioritize security along the international border with northern Ukraine throughout the invasion in favor of fortifying and reinforcing Russian positions in eastern and southern Ukraine.\[9\] The Kremlin has largely relied on Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia units, territorial defense units, and poorly trained conscripts to defend the border over the last three years.\[10\] Russian authorities were reportedly aware of the threat of a future Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast in the months leading up to August 2024 but failed to take adequate steps to address this threat.\[11\] Russian territorial defense and Chechen "Akhmat" forces successfully defended against limited cross-border raids into Belgorod and Kursk oblasts by pro-Russian all-Ukrainian forces in May and June 2023 and March 2024.\[12\] Russian forces' ability to defend against the raids and the Kremlin's inability to imagine that Ukraine could conduct a larger cross-border operation may have reinforced the Kremlin's decision to leave the border largely unmanned and vulnerable in Summer 2024.

Putin's apparent assessment that Russian forces are still capable of conducting successful offensive operations into northern Ukraine three years into the war has also disincentivized the Kremlin from fortifying the border. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces also used drones to exert control over some roads and prevent Russian forces from advancing into settlements where Ukrainian forces did not physically hold positions.\[20\] Another Russian milblogger noted that advancing Ukrainian mechanized columns had significant FPV drone support and that Ukrainian forces used the drones to strike targets, protect the column, and interdict Russian routes of advance.\[21\] The milblogger also acknowledged that Ukrainian mobile groups were "covered" in EW to a degree that prevented Russian drone operators from reconnoitering and striking the groups and called on Russia to produce-EW resistant drones.\[22\] Russian forces have in response developed and employed drones attached to fiber-optic cables that are more resistant to EW but have a more limited range.\[23\]

Ukrainian forces successfully leveraged ambiguity about their operational intent and capabilities to maintain operational surprise and make rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, despite the fact that Russian authorities were reportedly aware of Ukrainian troop buildup in Sumy Oblast.\[24\] Russian sources claimed that up to 11,000 likely elite and well-trained Ukrainian troops participated in the initial incursion — a number largely consistent with Western estimates and Ukrainian reporting — and the Ukrainian military command likely surged additional troops into Kursk Oblast in the weeks and months following the initial breakthrough.\[25\] Ukrainian officials have previously estimated that 11,000 Russian forces (likely including conscripts, FSB border guards, and Rosgvardia personnel) were operating in Kursk Oblast at the time of the Ukrainian incursion — meaning that Ukrainian forces made their most substantial gains into Kursk Oblast against a poorly trained and equipped but roughly equivalent Russian force grouping.\[26\] Russian forces were unprepared for both the time and manner in which Ukrainian forces attacked and for the innovative techniques that Ukrainian forces leveraged to integrate ground activity, air defense assets, and unmanned systems during the initial days of the incursion.\[27\] The current Ukrainian force grouping in Kursk Oblast is almost certainly larger than the initial incursion force but likely still significantly smaller than the estimated 78,000 Russian and North Korean troops currently operating in Kursk Oblast.\[28\] Russian forces were unprepared for both the time and manner in which Ukrainian forces attacked and for the innovative techniques that Ukrainian forces leveraged during the initial days of the incursion.\[29\]

**The frontline in Kursk began to stabilize as the Russian military command redeployed more forces and elements of elite units to address the incursion.** Reinforced Ukrainian units continued to marginally expand and level the bounds of their salient around the Lyubimovka-Malay Loknya-Sudzha-Guyevo arc in mid-August, and Ukrainian mobile groups conducted several more limited raids further into Kursk Oblast.\[30\] Russian forces began to slowly stabilize the situation as additional reinforcements, including forces originally intended to fight in northern Kharkiv Oblast and lower priority frontline areas, arrived from Ukraine in late August 2024.\[31\] The Russian military command quickly redeployed elements of the LMD from northern Kharkiv Oblast, Chechen forces from unspecified rear or frontline areas, irregular Russian units from frontline areas including in Donetsk Oblast, and additional conscripts from garrisons within Russia — including conscripts of the 217th Airborne (VDV) Regiment (98th VDV Division).\[32\] The Russian military command reportedly redeployed at least a company of the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade (2nd Combined Arms Army \[CAA\], Central Military District \[CMD\]) from its priority offensive operation in the Pokrovsk direction to Kursk Oblast during this time — indicating that the Russian military was struggling to fully insulate its priority offensive operation from the theater-wide impacts of the Kursk incursion.\[33\]

The Russian military command also began redeploying elements of relatively more elite VDV and Naval Infantry units from lower priority areas of Ukraine to reinforce the force grouping in Kursk Oblast. <image:7967>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kursk%20Direction%20February%2001%2C%202025_0.png)

**Russian forces may struggle to re-take Sudzha should Ukrainian forces choose to defend the town, but Russian forces are almost certainly capable of retaking the remainder of Kursk Oblast in the coming months.** US officials estimated in August 2024 that Russia likely needs 15 to 20 brigades — at least 50,000 troops, including a significant number redeployed from Ukraine or Russia's operational reserves - to retake Kursk Oblast.\[52\] Ukrainian sources estimated that Russian forces had accumulated over 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast as of late November 2024 ahead of concerted counteroffensive operations to retake the remainder of Kursk Oblast by late January 2025, and the Russian military command has only further reinforced this grouping.\[53\] Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi estimated on January 20 that Russian forces have concentrated 67,000 Russian troops and 11,000 North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast.\[54\] This overwhelming Russian force grouping is almost certainly capable of pushing Ukrainian forces from their remaining positions in Kursk Oblast in the coming months, but it remains unclear if the Russian military command will continue to prioritize further advances in Donetsk Oblast over the liberation of Kursk's border areas if the Russian forces in Kursk continue to struggle.

**Implications**

**ISW is not prepared to assess the long-term impacts of the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast at this time but will consider the short- to medium-term impacts of the incursion and implications of Ukraine's ability to inflict asymmetric consequences on the Russian military.**

**The Ukrainian incursion reportedly spoiled several Russian plans to attack into northern Ukraine and complicated Russian efforts to intensify offensive operations in northern Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Zaporizhia oblasts.** Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials warned as early as March 2024 that the Russian military command intended to conduct an offensive operation into northern Sumy or Kharkiv Oblast in Summer 2024.\[55\] Russian forces likely retained an interest in attacking Sumy Oblast after and amid the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast. Mikhail Zvinchuk, founder of the Kremlin-affiliated _Rybar_ Telegram channel, called for Russian forces to seize areas of Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts, and Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) Head Denis Pushilin explicitly called for Russia to seize Sumy City in May 2024.\[56\] Zelensky has repeatedly noted that the Ukrainian incursion stopped Russian plans to advance into several areas of northern Ukraine, including Sumy Oblast, and seize both Sumy and Kharkiv cities.\[57\]

The Russian offensive operation in northern Kharkiv Oblast had already culminated by the time Ukrainian forces launched the August 2024 incursion, but significant redeployments from the northern Kharkiv direction and from Russia's operational reserves intended to reinforce in northern Kharkiv Oblast likely prevented Russian forces from reintensifying offensive operations in the area in Fall 2024.\[58\] Ukrainian officials noted in November 2024 that Russian forces intended to renew offensive operations in western Zaporizhia Oblast, and the redeployment of VDV troops and other Russian forces from Zaporizhia Oblast may have delayed this Russian plan.\[59\] Russian attacks into northern Ukraine and the reintensification of Russian offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast and western Zaporizhia Oblast would have contributed to Russian efforts to stretch and penetrate Ukrainian defensive lines throughout the theater.\[60\] Ukrainian forces instead conducted a spoiling attack into Kursk Oblast and seized the battlefield initiative in this sector of the frontline.

Limited redeployments from frontline Russian units in priority areas of Donetsk Oblast, including the Pokrovsk direction, and larger redeployments from operational reserves intended to reinforce the Pokrovsk direction did not stop Russian gains in these areas but likely slowed these gains and may have forced the Russian military command to reevaluate their objectives in the area.\[61\] Russian milbloggers acknowledged in September 2024 that the Ukrainian incursion prompted manpower constraints that forced the Russian military command to adjust its plans in Donetsk Oblast.\[62\] ISW has previously noted that many of the Russian units redeployed from lower priority sectors of the frontline to Kursk Oblast could have served as reinforcements for the Russian military's priority offensive operations in the Pokrovsk direction and western Donetsk Oblast.\[63\] The recent deployment of Russian units from the Kurakhove direction to the Pokrovsk direction indicates that the Russian military command is actively seeking to reinforce offensive operations in the Pokrovsk direction at the expense of other very active areas of the frontline and would likely have preferred to redeploy available forces, especially VDV or naval infantry elements, from lower priority frontline areas to Pokrovsk had they been available.\[64\]

**The pressures that the incursion placed on Russian offensive operations in Ukraine highlight the reality that Russia does not have the reserves necessary to rapidly respond to unexpected Ukrainian activity in one sector without limiting or deprioritizing offensive operations in another sector.** Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets estimated in June 2024 that Russia had at most 60,000 personnel in its operational reserves and stated in October 2024 that the Russian military command originally intended to commit most of these forces to the Kharkiv and Toretsk-Pokrovsk-Kurakhove directions.\[65\] The Ukrainian incursion complicated this plan and US officials noted in August 2024 that Russia committed a significant portion of its operational reserves to slowing and containing the initial Ukrainian incursion force in Kursk Oblast.\[66\] The Kremlin is attempting to use North Korean forces to reinforce offensive operations in Kursk Oblast and offset limitations in Russia's domestic force generation capacity, but the North Korean deployment is currently too small to free up a significant number of Russian troops to return to Ukraine.\[67\] North Korea reportedly intends to deploy new military personnel to Russia by mid-March 2025, but it is unclear if these new forces constitute a rotation or additional deployment of forces, especially considering the reportedly very high losses the North Korean units in Russia have already sustained.\[68\]

The fact that the Russian military command had reportedly designated its reserves to support specific sectors rather than being available to support anywhere in the theater indicates that these were operational level reserves. Russia's lack of strategic level reserves has contributed to its slow response to the Ukrainian incursion and currently appears to be hindering Russia's efforts to reinforce Russian units to exploit tactical gains in the Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, and Velyka Novosilka directions and to exploit Ukrainian vulnerabilities in the Pokrovsk direction.

[!](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Elite%20Russian%20Unit%20Dispositions%20-%20August%207%2C%202024.png)

**The incursion pinned elite VDV and NI units in Kursk and has prevented them from redeploying to priority sectors of the frontline.** The Russian military command generally regards VDV and naval infantry elements as “elite” forces (even though many Russian elite units have lost their eliteness over the course of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine) and tends to deploy these forces in critical directions.\[69\] The Russian military command reportedly redeployed elements of each of the seven VDV formations and four of the six naval infantry formations from frontline positions in Ukraine to Kursk Oblast in the months following the incursion. ISW observed repeated reports that Russia redeployed elements of at least one regiment of both the 7th and 76th VDV divisions likely from Kherson and western Zaporizhia oblasts, elements of two regiments of the 106th VDV Division likely from the Siversk direction, elements of both the 11th and 83rd VDV brigades from the Chasiv Yar or Kharkiv directions, and limited elements of the 98th VDV Division from the Chasiv Yar direction and at least one report that Russian forces redeployed up to two battalions of the 104th VDV Division from the Kherson direction.\[70\] The Russian military command appears to have redeployed most of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and limited elements of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade, 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet, EMD), and 177th Naval Infantry Regiment (Caspian Flotilla) from Kharkiv, Donetsk, western Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.\[71\]

[!](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Elite%20Russian%20Unit%20Dispositions%20-%20January%2023%2C%202025.png)

Most of these VDV and naval infantry units are split between Kursk and frontline areas of Ukraine as of January 2025, including some higher priority areas such as the Chasiv Yar and Velyka Novosilka directions.\[72\] Elements of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade participated in the seizure of Velyka Novosilka in late January 2025, and elements of the 98th VDV Division are currently engaged in Russian efforts to seize Chasiv Yar and eventually pressure the Ukrainian fortress belt in Donetsk Oblast.\[73\] The redeployment of these forces is another indication that the Russian military failed to insulate higher priority sectors of the frontline from the theater-wide impacts of the Ukrainian incursion.

**The Ukrainian incursion has likely also drawn a notable amount of materiel from Russian operations in Ukraine.** Russian forces have conducted at least three battalion-sized mechanized assaults, several company-sized mechanized assaults, and several dozen platoon-sized mechanized assaults in the last six months in Kursk Oblast and sustained notable armored vehicle losses during most of the assaults.\[74\] The Russian military command is reinforcing its units in Kursk Oblast from Russia's shrinking Soviet-era tank and armored vehicle stocks and rearming these units is drawing materiel away from Ukraine.\[75\] Zelensky noted in September 2024 that Russian forces have also redirected artillery ammunition from Ukraine to defensive operations in Kursk Oblast.\[76\] Russian officials acknowledged in August 2024 that they redeployed additional drone supplies, mobile electronic warfare (EW) systems, radios, and radio jammers to the Russian force grouping.\[77\] The Russian military command also appears to have redeployed elements of the 98th VDV Division's 5th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment to Kursk Oblast, highlighting the fact that the incursion has also forced Russia to redeploy some air defense assets to defend its force grouping in Kursk Oblast.\[78\]

**Conclusion**

**The incursion has highlighted how Ukraine can exploit vulnerabilities in Russia's manpower reserves and theater-wide campaign design to exert limited control over Russian battlefield activity in Ukraine and generate strategically significant informational and political pressures on Russia.** Ukraine's campaign in Kursk Oblast demonstrates that surprise is still possible on the partially transparent battlefield of Ukraine — where an adversary can observe force concentrations but not reliably discern an enemy's operational intent and capabilities.\[79\] ISW previously noted that a key requirement of surprise is that the enemy must be unprepared to respond effectively, and Ukrainian forces were able to successfully obscure their operational intent and quickly integrate technological adaptations with mechanized maneuver to overwhelm the limited Russian force grouping in Kursk Oblast in the early days of the incursion.\[80\] Putin's unwillingness to acknowledge the shifting strategic realities of the war in Ukraine played well into these efforts — as Putin continues to underestimate both Ukrainian capabilities and will, which creates blind spots in Russia's ability to plan for and respond to Ukrainian operations.

The Ukrainian incursion showed the asymmetric impacts that Ukrainian forces can generate by successfully integrating technological adaptations with ground maneuver. Recent Ukrainian estimates indicate that Putin has accumulated roughly 67,000 Russian troops and 11,000 North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast expel a reinforced Ukrainian grouping in Kursk Oblast that now constitutes at most 30,000 troops by the most generous Western estimations.\[3\]

**Ukraine conducted the incursion at a critical moment to gain leverage in the battlespace and successfully inflicted asymmetric, theater-wide impacts on the Russian military with this limited ground operation.** The first seven months of 2024 were characterized by the Russian seizure of Avdiivka in February 2024, continued Russian offensive operations west of Avdiivka in Spring and Summer 2024, the Russian offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, and intensified Russian offensive operations in the Toretsk and Kurakhove directions in June and July 2024.\[4\] Critical delays in Western aid over the winter of 2023-2024 created shortages in Ukraine's air defense interceptors and Ukrainian artillery units and wider vulnerabilities in Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian attacks.\[5\] Western leaders and intelligence agencies spent most of early 2024 advocating for Ukraine to maintain an "active defense" and focus on repelling and slowing Russian advances before attempting another counteroffensive operation possibly in 2025.\[6\] The Ukrainian incursion refocused the conversation and allowed Ukraine to seize the narrative and tactical initiative. Ukraine's ability to contain Russia's May 2024 northern Kharkiv offensive objectively invalidated this assessment about Russian capabilities, however.\[13\] The Russian offensive into northern Kharkiv Oblast, in fact, further strained Russia's manpower reserves ahead of the Kursk incursion and tied up a significant number of troops from the Leningrad Military District (LMD) in Kharkiv Oblast, which complicated Russia's ability to respond to the Kursk incursion quickly.\[14\] The Kremlin apparently failed to internalize the lessons of its failed northern Kharkiv offensive, and Ukrainian reports that Russian forces intended to launch new offensive efforts into Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts in Summer 2024 indicate that the Kremlin continued to assess that Russian forces could successfully launch new offensive efforts into northern Ukraine despite their operational failure in Kharkiv.\[15\]

**Ukrainian forces largely relied on small and maneuverable mechanized mobile groups during the initial days of the incursion in August 2024 to advance up to 35 kilometers into Kursk Oblast by exploiting the vulnerabilities along Russia's border.** Ukrainian mobile groups advanced through a series of limited Russian fortifications along the international border near Nikolayevo-Darino (north of Sumy City along the international border) and Oleshnya (just northeast of Sumy City along the border) on August 6 and quickly seized the Sudzha border checkpoint south of Sudzha and captured a group of conscripts defending the checkpoint.\[16\] These mobile groups advanced rapidly in southern Kursk Oblast as other Ukrainian units followed behind to consolidate control of seized settlements and exploited the confusion among Russian troops during the initial days of the incursion to make rapid and deep penetrations behind Russian units.\[17\] Ukrainian mobile groups made rapid advances from Nikolayevo-Darino up to Korenevo (roughly 20 kilometers from the border) and from Oleshnya towards and into Sudzha (9 kilometers from the border) and further north near Malaya Loknya (12 kilometers from the border) and possibly as far as Anastasyevka (27 kilometers from the border) and Milutino (35 kilometers from the border) in the following days.\[18\]

Ukrainian mobile groups also leveraged unique technological adaptations in the first days of the incursion."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The presence of an American flag patch on a military uniform, as seen in the image, does not automatically confirm the presence of American mercenaries. The search results show that American flag patches are available for purchase and can be worn on military uniforms. The claim requires further evidence to confirm the individuals are mercenaries.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unsupported. While there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as documented by sources like Al Jazeera and the Institute for the Study of War ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment)), there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of American mercenaries. The presence of American flag patches on uniforms, as shown in the image, does not confirm the individuals are mercenaries, as such patches are commercially available.
