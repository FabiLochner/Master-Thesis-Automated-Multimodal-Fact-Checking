Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on January 15, 2025, debunks a claim circulating on social media that alleges a list of US politicians, including Joe Biden, received bribes from Ukraine. The article states that the claim is false, with no evidence to support it, and that it likely originates from pro-Russian propaganda. The article mentions the image shows a list of politicians with amounts they supposedly received. The article also notes that other fact-checkers have debunked the claim previously. <image:18>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on July 21, 2023, discusses an FBI document released by Senator Chuck Grassley alleging that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm. The document is an unverified memo from an FBI informant. The article mentions that there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. <image:7718>, <image:7720>, <image:7722>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-ukraine-didn-143708765.html): 
Content: The AOL article, published on January 9, 2025, fact-checks the claim that Ukraine released a list of politicians taking bribes. The article states that there is no evidence to support this claim and that it originated from a Thai-language website in October 2023. The article references Check Your Fact and The Dispatch Fact Check, which also debunked the claim. <image:7723>, <image:7724>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes is false. Multiple sources, including Euronews and AOL, debunk this claim, stating it is likely pro-Russian propaganda and lacks supporting evidence. The image itself appears to be a list of politicians and their estimated wealth, not a list of bribes.

So, the overall veracity is: false
