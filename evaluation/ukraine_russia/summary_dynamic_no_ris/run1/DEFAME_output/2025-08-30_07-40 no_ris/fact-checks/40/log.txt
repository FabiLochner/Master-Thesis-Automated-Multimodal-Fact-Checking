Useful result: From [Source](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelensky/): 
Content: Al Jazeera, February 2025, reports that Elon Musk pledged to "fix" X's fact-checking tool. Musk shared an unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

The claim 'In February 2025 Elon Musk posted on X that he is planning to suspend Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s X account.' is false.
Justification: In February 2025, Elon Musk expressed criticism of X's "Community Notes" feature and disagreed with polling data related to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as reported by Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html)). However, there is no evidence in the search results to support the claim that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.

So, the overall veracity is: false
