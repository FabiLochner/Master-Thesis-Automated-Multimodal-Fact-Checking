## Elaboration

The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) and the CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html)) focus on Musk's criticism of the platform's features and his views on Zelenskyy's approval ratings.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

However, the provided evidence does not mention any plans by Musk to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.
