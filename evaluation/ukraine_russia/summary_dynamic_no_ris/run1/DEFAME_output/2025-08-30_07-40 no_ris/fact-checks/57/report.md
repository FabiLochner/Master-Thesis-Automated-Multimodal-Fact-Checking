## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The University of California, Berkeley, published an article on January 29, 2025, discussing an AI-generated audio of Donald Trump criticizing Keir Starmer, overlaid on a video interview with Theo Von from August 21, 2024, where the topics of the UK and Ukraine were not discussed. The article references a fact-check by Full Fact. Grabien published a fact check on February 5, 2025, stating that Trump did not criticize Keir Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine in an interview with Theo Von in August 2024.

A Yahoo article discusses an interview with Donald Trump on Theo Von's podcast, which was posted on Tuesday, where Trump discussed various topics, including the 2024 presidential election, but did not mention Keir Starmer or a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine. ![image 1220](media/2025-08-06_18-35-1754505335-902827.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including a fact-check by Grabien, state that Donald Trump did not criticize Keir Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine in an interview with Theo Von in August 2024. Furthermore, a Yahoo article about the interview confirms that these topics were not discussed. An AI-generated audio of Trump criticizing Starmer was created and overlaid on a video of the interview.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Trump did not discuss Keir Starmer or the UK-Ukraine deal in the Theo Von interview. An AI-generated audio was created to make it appear as if he did.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Grabien](https://news.grabien.com/wire-fact-check-no-donald-trump-did-not-criticize-keir-starmer-over-a-100-y) and a [Yahoo article](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/thats-down-dirty-donald-trump-170420799.html) confirm that Trump did not criticize Keir Starmer or discuss the UK-Ukraine deal during his August 2024 interview with Theo Von.
