## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a claim that a Fox News article reported that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. One source, [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/), debunks this claim, stating that the article was not published by Fox News and that the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center. Another source, [dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118), also fact-checks the claim, stating that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The article also mentions that the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). A Wikipedia article ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine))) provides information about the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine, a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. ![image 11](media/14.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is not entirely accurate. While the image appears to be a screenshot of a Fox News article, the evidence suggests it is a manipulated one. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Fox News published the article. Furthermore, the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that the Fox News article is a manipulated screenshot. The article was not published by Fox News, and the author did not publish any articles on the topic. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE
