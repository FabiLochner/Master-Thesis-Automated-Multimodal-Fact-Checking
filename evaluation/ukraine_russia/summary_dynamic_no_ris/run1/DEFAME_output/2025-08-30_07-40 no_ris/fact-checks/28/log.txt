Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror): 
Content: The Los Angeles Times published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Lech Wałęsa and other former political prisoners wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing his behavior toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. <image:i>. The article mentions that Wałęsa found Trump's actions offensive.

The claim 'In March 2025 former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing the U.S. President's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: In March 2025, Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump, as reported by sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5317474/nobel-peace-prize-winner-lech-walesa-condemns-president-trumps-treatment-of-zelenskyy), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/), and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror). However, the available evidence indicates that the letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, not the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
