# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

 By the end of the first week, the Ukrainian military said it had captured 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi) of Russian territory, while Russian authorities acknowledged that Ukraine had captured 28 settlements.[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)

In the second half of August the front stabilized,[\[42\]](#cite_note-forbes_20240911-44)

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct.

 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

 Russian foreign ministry spokesperson [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")

[\[397\]](#cite_note-399)
 A Russian academic with close ties to senior Russian diplomats said that Putin probably lost interest in further talks in Qatar because the "Russian leadership usually does not make any compromises under pressure" and attacks on energy infrastructure are highly effective tactics that do more damage to Ukraine than to Russia, adding that Russia is more interested in talks with Ukraine about a broader ceasefire.[\[306\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-308)

I ended up carrying him in my arms, and he spent the whole journey hiding under the seat of the car.”![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_August_13](/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/INTERACTIVE-ATTACKON-KURSK_August_13-1723562851.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

Local Telegram channels are filled with offers of free accommodation in various Russian cities, and the government has offered evacuees a one-time payment of 10,000 roubles (just over $100) as compensation although there may be additional payments, for example 600,000 roubles ($6,500) in case of serious injury.

“The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response, and all the goals facing us will undoubtedly be achieved,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, ordering security services to conduct a “counterterrorist operation” in the region.

‘A strong move’
---------------

The Russian media, which is largely aligned with the Kremlin, has grudgingly acknowledged the Ukrainians’ success.

“The Zelenskyy regime has made a strong move – with all the resulting not-very-pleasant conclusions and consequences for our side,” columnist Mikhail Rostovsky wrote for the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“If you are dealing with a strong adversary (and no sane person has long doubted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are a strong and highly motivated adversary for Russia), you must be prepared for the fact that from time to time they will make strong and unexpected moves that will catch you off-guard.”

These successes were not lost on the exiled opposition.

Politician Leonid Gozman praised the Ukrainian troops.

“The actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces speak not only of their high professionalism, but also of the creativity of the Ukrainian leadership,” Gozman wrote in Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper that often takes aim at the Kremlin.

“Someone said to them: ‘Why not?’ and they did what no one expected of them, completely changing the picture of the war. We have enough unused reserves.”

Alexey Malinin, founder of the Center for International Interaction and Cooperation, told Al Jazeera that from the Russian perspective, the invasion of Kursk is counterproductive to peace talks.

“The incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region shows that Ukraine aims to strengthen its negotiating position,” he said.

“However, this act does nothing to bring the negotiation process nearer. As President Zelenskyy rightly noted, the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise.”

Gozman noted that Russian citizens have not yet resisted the Ukrainians en masse and disparaged Russia’s defence capabilities.

“Just as during the days of \[Yevgeny\] Prigozhin’s rebellion it suddenly became clear that the various Russian Guards were only good at fighting peaceful demonstrators, and did not want to go up against armed bandits,” he said, referring to the late leader of the Wagner Group mercenary force.

“So now it turned out that the border guards were not capable of confronting a real threat (and it was not their fault, they were designed for something else), that the formidable Chechen troops had missed the enemy for the umpteenth time, otherwise they would have certainly routed him, but it did not happen, and most importantly, our generals are good at attacking other countries, but not at defending their own.”

Pro-Kremlin Russian media have repeatedly accused the Ukrainian army of targeting civilians, including a drone strike on an ambulance that killed its driver and one paramedic and wounded another.

There have also been reports that Ukrainian soldiers opened fire on cars in the village of Kurilovka, fatally wounding a pregnant woman, and took captive volunteers who were helping evacuate civilians.

On his talk show on Rossiya-1, Putin-friendly TV host Vladimir Solovyov accused Ukraine’s Western backers of masterminding the incursion.

“What we’re witnessing is an unprecedented escalation,” he told viewers.

“Western countries are sincerely attempting to say, ‘We weren’t involved. The second probable goal is an attempt to stake out a foothold in the territory of Kursk Oblast for subsequent bargaining in these or other negotiations. Ukraine won’t improve its negotiating position, only, at best, delay the discussion of a peaceful resolution, but the final scenario can be much worse for the Ukraine.”

Malinin added that after the Kursk situation is resolved, the Russian military will retaliate with an “intensive offensive”.

Content: "Ukraine may be able to do so if Western support continues to empower Ukrainian innovation.

**The Russian military command has gathered around 78,000 troops, including 11,000 North Koreans, in an attempt to expel Ukrainian forces from positions in Kursk Oblast over the last six months.** An estimated 11,000 Ukrainian forces advanced into Kursk Oblast in early August 2024, seizing the tactical initiative and complicating the Russian military's Fall 2024 offensive effort.\[1\] Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly delayed his deadlines for Russian forces to push Ukrainian troops from Kursk Oblast first by mid-October 2024 then by January 2025 and repeatedly prioritized Russian advances in Donetsk Oblast over regaining control of the Kursk salient, which Russian forces still had not done at the end of January 2025.\[2\] Putin has not been able fully to insulate Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast from the theater-wide impacts of the incursion, however, and the Russian military has simultaneously been pulling troops, armored vehicles, and artillery and air defense systems away from other sectors in Ukraine to reinforce the Russian force grouping fighting in Kursk Oblast. The Kremlin has failed to prioritize security along the international border with northern Ukraine throughout the invasion in favor of fortifying and reinforcing Russian positions in eastern and southern Ukraine.\[9\] The Kremlin has largely relied on Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia units, territorial defense units, and poorly trained conscripts to defend the border over the last three years.\[10\] Russian authorities were reportedly aware of the threat of a future Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast in the months leading up to August 2024 but failed to take adequate steps to address this threat.\[11\] Russian territorial defense and Chechen "Akhmat" forces successfully defended against limited cross-border raids into Belgorod and Kursk oblasts by pro-Russian all-Ukrainian forces in May and June 2023 and March 2024.\[12\] Russian forces' ability to defend against the raids and the Kremlin's inability to imagine that Ukraine could conduct a larger cross-border operation may have reinforced the Kremlin's decision to leave the border largely unmanned and vulnerable in Summer 2024.

Putin's apparent assessment that Russian forces are still capable of conducting successful offensive operations into northern Ukraine three years into the war has also disincentivized the Kremlin from fortifying the border. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces also used drones to exert control over some roads and prevent Russian forces from advancing into settlements where Ukrainian forces did not physically hold positions.\[20\] Another Russian milblogger noted that advancing Ukrainian mechanized columns had significant FPV drone support and that Ukrainian forces used the drones to strike targets, protect the column, and interdict Russian routes of advance.\[21\] The milblogger also acknowledged that Ukrainian mobile groups were "covered" in EW to a degree that prevented Russian drone operators from reconnoitering and striking the groups and called on Russia to produce-EW resistant drones.\[22\] Russian forces have in response developed and employed drones attached to fiber-optic cables that are more resistant to EW but have a more limited range.\[23\]

Ukrainian forces successfully leveraged ambiguity about their operational intent and capabilities to maintain operational surprise and make rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, despite the fact that Russian authorities were reportedly aware of Ukrainian troop buildup in Sumy Oblast.\[24\] Russian sources claimed that up to 11,000 likely elite and well-trained Ukrainian troops participated in the initial incursion — a number largely consistent with Western estimates and Ukrainian reporting — and the Ukrainian military command likely surged additional troops into Kursk Oblast in the weeks and months following the initial breakthrough.\[25\] Ukrainian officials have previously estimated that 11,000 Russian forces (likely including conscripts, FSB border guards, and Rosgvardia personnel) were operating in Kursk Oblast at the time of the Ukrainian incursion — meaning that Ukrainian forces made their most substantial gains into Kursk Oblast against a poorly trained and equipped but roughly equivalent Russian force grouping.\[26\] Russian forces were unprepared for both the time and manner in which Ukrainian forces attacked and for the innovative techniques that Ukrainian forces leveraged to integrate ground activity, air defense assets, and unmanned systems during the initial days of the incursion.\[27\] The current Ukrainian force grouping in Kursk Oblast is almost certainly larger than the initial incursion force but likely still significantly smaller than the estimated 78,000 Russian and North Korean troops currently operating in Kursk Oblast.\[28\] Russian forces were unprepared for both the time and manner in which Ukrainian forces attacked and for the innovative techniques that Ukrainian forces leveraged during the initial days of the incursion.\[29\]

**The frontline in Kursk began to stabilize as the Russian military command redeployed more forces and elements of elite units to address the incursion.** Reinforced Ukrainian units continued to marginally expand and level the bounds of their salient around the Lyubimovka-Malay Loknya-Sudzha-Guyevo arc in mid-August, and Ukrainian mobile groups conducted several more limited raids further into Kursk Oblast.\[30\] Russian forces began to slowly stabilize the situation as additional reinforcements, including forces originally intended to fight in northern Kharkiv Oblast and lower priority frontline areas, arrived from Ukraine in late August 2024.\[31\] The Russian military command quickly redeployed elements of the LMD from northern Kharkiv Oblast, Chechen forces from unspecified rear or frontline areas, irregular Russian units from frontline areas including in Donetsk Oblast, and additional conscripts from garrisons within Russia — including conscripts of the 217th Airborne (VDV) Regiment (98th VDV Division).\[32\] The Russian military command reportedly redeployed at least a company of the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade (2nd Combined Arms Army \[CAA\], Central Military District \[CMD\]) from its priority offensive operation in the Pokrovsk direction to Kursk Oblast during this time — indicating that the Russian military was struggling to fully insulate its priority offensive operation from the theater-wide impacts of the Kursk incursion.\[33\]

The Russian military command also began redeploying elements of relatively more elite VDV and Naval Infantry units from lower priority areas of Ukraine to reinforce the force grouping in Kursk Oblast. <image:7967>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kursk%20Direction%20February%2001%2C%202025_0.png)

**Russian forces may struggle to re-take Sudzha should Ukrainian forces choose to defend the town, but Russian forces are almost certainly capable of retaking the remainder of Kursk Oblast in the coming months.** US officials estimated in August 2024 that Russia likely needs 15 to 20 brigades — at least 50,000 troops, including a significant number redeployed from Ukraine or Russia's operational reserves - to retake Kursk Oblast.\[52\] Ukrainian sources estimated that Russian forces had accumulated over 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast as of late November 2024 ahead of concerted counteroffensive operations to retake the remainder of Kursk Oblast by late January 2025, and the Russian military command has only further reinforced this grouping.\[53\] Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi estimated on January 20 that Russian forces have concentrated 67,000 Russian troops and 11,000 North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast.\[54\] This overwhelming Russian force grouping is almost certainly capable of pushing Ukrainian forces from their remaining positions in Kursk Oblast in the coming months, but it remains unclear if the Russian military command will continue to prioritize further advances in Donetsk Oblast over the liberation of Kursk's border areas if the Russian forces in Kursk continue to struggle.

**Implications**

**ISW is not prepared to assess the long-term impacts of the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast at this time but will consider the short- to medium-term impacts of the incursion and implications of Ukraine's ability to inflict asymmetric consequences on the Russian military.**

**The Ukrainian incursion reportedly spoiled several Russian plans to attack into northern Ukraine and complicated Russian efforts to intensify offensive operations in northern Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Zaporizhia oblasts.** Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials warned as early as March 2024 that the Russian military command intended to conduct an offensive operation into northern Sumy or Kharkiv Oblast in Summer 2024.\[55\] Russian forces likely retained an interest in attacking Sumy Oblast after and amid the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast. Mikhail Zvinchuk, founder of the Kremlin-affiliated _Rybar_ Telegram channel, called for Russian forces to seize areas of Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts, and Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) Head Denis Pushilin explicitly called for Russia to seize Sumy City in May 2024.\[56\] Zelensky has repeatedly noted that the Ukrainian incursion stopped Russian plans to advance into several areas of northern Ukraine, including Sumy Oblast, and seize both Sumy and Kharkiv cities.\[57\]

The Russian offensive operation in northern Kharkiv Oblast had already culminated by the time Ukrainian forces launched the August 2024 incursion, but significant redeployments from the northern Kharkiv direction and from Russia's operational reserves intended to reinforce in northern Kharkiv Oblast likely prevented Russian forces from reintensifying offensive operations in the area in Fall 2024.\[58\] Ukrainian officials noted in November 2024 that Russian forces intended to renew offensive operations in western Zaporizhia Oblast, and the redeployment of VDV troops and other Russian forces from Zaporizhia Oblast may have delayed this Russian plan.\[59\] Russian attacks into northern Ukraine and the reintensification of Russian offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast and western Zaporizhia Oblast would have contributed to Russian efforts to stretch and penetrate Ukrainian defensive lines throughout the theater.\[60\] Ukrainian forces instead conducted a spoiling attack into Kursk Oblast and seized the battlefield initiative in this sector of the frontline.

Limited redeployments from frontline Russian units in priority areas of Donetsk Oblast, including the Pokrovsk direction, and larger redeployments from operational reserves intended to reinforce the Pokrovsk direction did not stop Russian gains in these areas but likely slowed these gains and may have forced the Russian military command to reevaluate their objectives in the area.\[61\] Russian milbloggers acknowledged in September 2024 that the Ukrainian incursion prompted manpower constraints that forced the Russian military command to adjust its plans in Donetsk Oblast.\[62\] ISW has previously noted that many of the Russian units redeployed from lower priority sectors of the frontline to Kursk Oblast could have served as reinforcements for the Russian military's priority offensive operations in the Pokrovsk direction and western Donetsk Oblast.\[63\] The recent deployment of Russian units from the Kurakhove direction to the Pokrovsk direction indicates that the Russian military command is actively seeking to reinforce offensive operations in the Pokrovsk direction at the expense of other very active areas of the frontline and would likely have preferred to redeploy available forces, especially VDV or naval infantry elements, from lower priority frontline areas to Pokrovsk had they been available.\[64\]

**The pressures that the incursion placed on Russian offensive operations in Ukraine highlight the reality that Russia does not have the reserves necessary to rapidly respond to unexpected Ukrainian activity in one sector without limiting or deprioritizing offensive operations in another sector.** Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets estimated in June 2024 that Russia had at most 60,000 personnel in its operational reserves and stated in October 2024 that the Russian military command originally intended to commit most of these forces to the Kharkiv and Toretsk-Pokrovsk-Kurakhove directions.\[65\] The Ukrainian incursion complicated this plan and US officials noted in August 2024 that Russia committed a significant portion of its operational reserves to slowing and containing the initial Ukrainian incursion force in Kursk Oblast.\[66\] The Kremlin is attempting to use North Korean forces to reinforce offensive operations in Kursk Oblast and offset limitations in Russia's domestic force generation capacity, but the North Korean deployment is currently too small to free up a significant number of Russian troops to return to Ukraine.\[67\] North Korea reportedly intends to deploy new military personnel to Russia by mid-March 2025, but it is unclear if these new forces constitute a rotation or additional deployment of forces, especially considering the reportedly very high losses the North Korean units in Russia have already sustained.\[68\]

The fact that the Russian military command had reportedly designated its reserves to support specific sectors rather than being available to support anywhere in the theater indicates that these were operational level reserves. Russia's lack of strategic level reserves has contributed to its slow response to the Ukrainian incursion and currently appears to be hindering Russia's efforts to reinforce Russian units to exploit tactical gains in the Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, and Velyka Novosilka directions and to exploit Ukrainian vulnerabilities in the Pokrovsk direction.

[!](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Elite%20Russian%20Unit%20Dispositions%20-%20August%207%2C%202024.png)

**The incursion pinned elite VDV and NI units in Kursk and has prevented them from redeploying to priority sectors of the frontline.** The Russian military command generally regards VDV and naval infantry elements as “elite” forces (even though many Russian elite units have lost their eliteness over the course of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine) and tends to deploy these forces in critical directions.\[69\] The Russian military command reportedly redeployed elements of each of the seven VDV formations and four of the six naval infantry formations from frontline positions in Ukraine to Kursk Oblast in the months following the incursion. ISW observed repeated reports that Russia redeployed elements of at least one regiment of both the 7th and 76th VDV divisions likely from Kherson and western Zaporizhia oblasts, elements of two regiments of the 106th VDV Division likely from the Siversk direction, elements of both the 11th and 83rd VDV brigades from the Chasiv Yar or Kharkiv directions, and limited elements of the 98th VDV Division from the Chasiv Yar direction and at least one report that Russian forces redeployed up to two battalions of the 104th VDV Division from the Kherson direction.\[70\] The Russian military command appears to have redeployed most of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and limited elements of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade, 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet, EMD), and 177th Naval Infantry Regiment (Caspian Flotilla) from Kharkiv, Donetsk, western Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.\[71\]

[!](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Elite%20Russian%20Unit%20Dispositions%20-%20January%2023%2C%202025.png)

Most of these VDV and naval infantry units are split between Kursk and frontline areas of Ukraine as of January 2025, including some higher priority areas such as the Chasiv Yar and Velyka Novosilka directions.\[72\] Elements of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade participated in the seizure of Velyka Novosilka in late January 2025, and elements of the 98th VDV Division are currently engaged in Russian efforts to seize Chasiv Yar and eventually pressure the Ukrainian fortress belt in Donetsk Oblast.\[73\] The redeployment of these forces is another indication that the Russian military failed to insulate higher priority sectors of the frontline from the theater-wide impacts of the Ukrainian incursion.

**The Ukrainian incursion has likely also drawn a notable amount of materiel from Russian operations in Ukraine.** Russian forces have conducted at least three battalion-sized mechanized assaults, several company-sized mechanized assaults, and several dozen platoon-sized mechanized assaults in the last six months in Kursk Oblast and sustained notable armored vehicle losses during most of the assaults.\[74\] The Russian military command is reinforcing its units in Kursk Oblast from Russia's shrinking Soviet-era tank and armored vehicle stocks and rearming these units is drawing materiel away from Ukraine.\[75\] Zelensky noted in September 2024 that Russian forces have also redirected artillery ammunition from Ukraine to defensive operations in Kursk Oblast.\[76\] Russian officials acknowledged in August 2024 that they redeployed additional drone supplies, mobile electronic warfare (EW) systems, radios, and radio jammers to the Russian force grouping.\[77\] The Russian military command also appears to have redeployed elements of the 98th VDV Division's 5th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment to Kursk Oblast, highlighting the fact that the incursion has also forced Russia to redeploy some air defense assets to defend its force grouping in Kursk Oblast.\[78\]

**Conclusion**

**The incursion has highlighted how Ukraine can exploit vulnerabilities in Russia's manpower reserves and theater-wide campaign design to exert limited control over Russian battlefield activity in Ukraine and generate strategically significant informational and political pressures on Russia.** Ukraine's campaign in Kursk Oblast demonstrates that surprise is still possible on the partially transparent battlefield of Ukraine — where an adversary can observe force concentrations but not reliably discern an enemy's operational intent and capabilities.\[79\] ISW previously noted that a key requirement of surprise is that the enemy must be unprepared to respond effectively, and Ukrainian forces were able to successfully obscure their operational intent and quickly integrate technological adaptations with mechanized maneuver to overwhelm the limited Russian force grouping in Kursk Oblast in the early days of the incursion.\[80\] Putin's unwillingness to acknowledge the shifting strategic realities of the war in Ukraine played well into these efforts — as Putin continues to underestimate both Ukrainian capabilities and will, which creates blind spots in Russia's ability to plan for and respond to Ukrainian operations.

The Ukrainian incursion showed the asymmetric impacts that Ukrainian forces can generate by successfully integrating technological adaptations with ground maneuver. Recent Ukrainian estimates indicate that Putin has accumulated roughly 67,000 Russian troops and 11,000 North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast expel a reinforced Ukrainian grouping in Kursk Oblast that now constitutes at most 30,000 troops by the most generous Western estimations.\[3\]

**Ukraine conducted the incursion at a critical moment to gain leverage in the battlespace and successfully inflicted asymmetric, theater-wide impacts on the Russian military with this limited ground operation.** The first seven months of 2024 were characterized by the Russian seizure of Avdiivka in February 2024, continued Russian offensive operations west of Avdiivka in Spring and Summer 2024, the Russian offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, and intensified Russian offensive operations in the Toretsk and Kurakhove directions in June and July 2024.\[4\] Critical delays in Western aid over the winter of 2023-2024 created shortages in Ukraine's air defense interceptors and Ukrainian artillery units and wider vulnerabilities in Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian attacks.\[5\] Western leaders and intelligence agencies spent most of early 2024 advocating for Ukraine to maintain an "active defense" and focus on repelling and slowing Russian advances before attempting another counteroffensive operation possibly in 2025.\[6\] The Ukrainian incursion refocused the conversation and allowed Ukraine to seize the narrative and tactical initiative. Ukraine's ability to contain Russia's May 2024 northern Kharkiv offensive objectively invalidated this assessment about Russian capabilities, however.\[13\] The Russian offensive into northern Kharkiv Oblast, in fact, further strained Russia's manpower reserves ahead of the Kursk incursion and tied up a significant number of troops from the Leningrad Military District (LMD) in Kharkiv Oblast, which complicated Russia's ability to respond to the Kursk incursion quickly.\[14\] The Kremlin apparently failed to internalize the lessons of its failed northern Kharkiv offensive, and Ukrainian reports that Russian forces intended to launch new offensive efforts into Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts in Summer 2024 indicate that the Kremlin continued to assess that Russian forces could successfully launch new offensive efforts into northern Ukraine despite their operational failure in Kharkiv.\[15\]

**Ukrainian forces largely relied on small and maneuverable mechanized mobile groups during the initial days of the incursion in August 2024 to advance up to 35 kilometers into Kursk Oblast by exploiting the vulnerabilities along Russia's border.** Ukrainian mobile groups advanced through a series of limited Russian fortifications along the international border near Nikolayevo-Darino (north of Sumy City along the international border) and Oleshnya (just northeast of Sumy City along the border) on August 6 and quickly seized the Sudzha border checkpoint south of Sudzha and captured a group of conscripts defending the checkpoint.\[16\] These mobile groups advanced rapidly in southern Kursk Oblast as other Ukrainian units followed behind to consolidate control of seized settlements and exploited the confusion among Russian troops during the initial days of the incursion to make rapid and deep penetrations behind Russian units.\[17\] Ukrainian mobile groups made rapid advances from Nikolayevo-Darino up to Korenevo (roughly 20 kilometers from the border) and from Oleshnya towards and into Sudzha (9 kilometers from the border) and further north near Malaya Loknya (12 kilometers from the border) and possibly as far as Anastasyevka (27 kilometers from the border) and Milutino (35 kilometers from the border) in the following days.\[18\]

Ukrainian mobile groups also leveraged unique technological adaptations in the first days of the incursion."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The presence of an American flag patch on a military uniform, as seen in the image, does not automatically confirm the presence of American mercenaries. The search results show that American flag patches are available for purchase and can be worn on military uniforms. The claim requires further evidence to confirm the individuals are mercenaries.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unsupported. While there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as documented by sources like Al Jazeera and the Institute for the Study of War ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment)), there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of American mercenaries. The presence of American flag patches on uniforms, as shown in the image, does not confirm the individuals are mercenaries, as such patches are commercially available.
