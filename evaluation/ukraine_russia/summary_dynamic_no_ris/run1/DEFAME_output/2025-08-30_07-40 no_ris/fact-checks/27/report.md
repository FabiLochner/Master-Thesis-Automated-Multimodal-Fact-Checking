## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A Yahoo News fact-check from Snopes rates the claim as "False". Zelenskyy declared fewer than 15 properties, none in the U.S., and no planes. He has an overseas bank account holding around $377,000, and his annual income was around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. The Times of India states that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelenskyâ€™s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

### Evidence from `web_search`
Myth Detector, in an article published on March 6, 2025, discusses claims about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wealth, stating that his income decreased after the war began and that his net worth is less than $30 million, according to Forbes data from 2022. The article also includes links to several Myth Detector reports debunking claims about Zelenskyy's real estate holdings.

An AOL article from April 24, 2022, states that Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed assets worth 37 million hryvnias. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million, and his monthly income as president is $930.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. Evidence indicates that Zelenskyy does not own 15 homes, a $35 million home in Florida, or three private planes. His overseas bank account holds approximately $377,000, not $1.2 billion. His monthly income is around $25,000, not $11 million.

Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, and his net worth is less than $30 million. He declared assets worth 37 million hryvnias in 2018.

The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelenskyy and his inner circle were beneficiaries of offshore companies.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including fact-checks by Yahoo News and Myth Detector, contradicts the claim. Zelenskyy's actual assets and income are significantly less than what is stated in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) show that Zelenskyy's assets and income are significantly lower than what the claim states. His real estate holdings are worth around $4 million, and his net worth is less than $30 million.
