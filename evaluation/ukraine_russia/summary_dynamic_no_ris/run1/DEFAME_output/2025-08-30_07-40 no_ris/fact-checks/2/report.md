NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, discussing a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office (![image 1572](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592644-705128.jpg), ![image 1569](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592639-153450.jpg), ![image 1570](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592640-602508.jpg)). Trump criticized Zelenskyy's gratitude for U.S. support and later posted on Truth Social that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Reuters published an article on February 19, 2025, discussing the relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including Trump calling Zelenskyy a "dictator" and Zelenskyy accusing Trump of spreading Russian disinformation (![image 1573](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592657-229427.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The provided articles from PBS and Reuters indicate that Trump and Zelenskyy were actively communicating and interacting with each other on Truth Social. There is no mention of Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

To verify the claim, information about any actions taken by Zelenskyy to block access to Truth Social in February 2025 is needed.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Trump and Zelenskyy were communicating on Truth Social in February 2025. There is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy blocked access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there was active communication between Trump and Zelenskyy, including Trump's posts on Truth Social, there is no evidence from sources like PBS News and Reuters to support the assertion that Zelenskyy blocked access to Truth Social in Ukraine in February 2025.
