## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources indicate that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake. The cover, dated March 20, 2025, with serial number 1705, was not published by Charlie Hebdo. The real cover was published on March 19, 2025. Another article from Yahoo News discusses a fake Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy and the late Pope Francis. The real Charlie Hebdo edition from April 23, 2025, looks completely different from the fake one.
