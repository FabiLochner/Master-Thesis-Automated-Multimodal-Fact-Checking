## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that 18 British Special Forces members were killed in the Odessa Region of Ukraine in November 2024 is misleading. The image used in the claim has been digitally altered; the original image is from a 2006 BBC article about a RAF Nimrod crash in Afghanistan. A Dutch journalist's claim that a Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers in Odesa was debunked by a Ukrainian military spokesperson. The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" provides casualty figures for both sides of the conflict.
