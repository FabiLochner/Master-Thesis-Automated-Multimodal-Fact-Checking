The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not entirely supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, other sources like the Russia Matters report ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)) and Meduza provide different figures, making it difficult to verify the exact number of losses by February 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
