## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with 48,000 missing in the Ukraine war (<image:k>, <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:main022625.jpg>, <image:donbas022625_0.jpg>, <image:kursk022625_0.jpg>, <image:pokrovsk022625.jpg>). A Wikipedia article on casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War states that a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties for Russia by July 2024, and Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian deaths by the end of 2024. The article also mentions that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides an estimate of Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate on February 24, 2025, with data as of December 2024. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. A Wikipedia article cites a British Army official estimating 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, and Meduza estimated over 165,000 deaths by the end of 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is partially supported by the British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024. However, the Russia Matters report and Meduza provide different figures.

The evidence does not provide a definitive number for February 2025, but it does offer estimates from different sources, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses, with estimates varying significantly. While some sources suggest figures that could support the claim, others offer different numbers, making it difficult to definitively confirm the claim's accuracy.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not entirely supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, other sources like the Russia Matters report ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)) and Meduza provide different figures, making it difficult to verify the exact number of losses by February 2025.
