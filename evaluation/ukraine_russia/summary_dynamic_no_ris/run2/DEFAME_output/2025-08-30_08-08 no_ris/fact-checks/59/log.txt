The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the provided evidence confirms the wealth of the politicians listed in the image, it does not support the assertion that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine detailing bribes. The search results and image searches provide information on the net worth of the politicians, such as Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, but do not mention any bribes or the source of the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
