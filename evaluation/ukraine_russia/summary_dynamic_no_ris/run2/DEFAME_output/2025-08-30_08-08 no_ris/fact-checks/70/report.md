## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. While the BBC article discusses the war in Ukraine and the Journal of Democracy mentions Putin's hostile policies towards the United States, neither provides any evidence of a declaration of war.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from Fact Crescendo directly refutes the claim, stating that there has been no declaration of war by Russia against the USA. The other sources discuss related topics but do not support the claim.

`false`
