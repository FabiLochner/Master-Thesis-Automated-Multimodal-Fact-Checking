Content: The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine. The audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies. The audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. The DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The report is from 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on February 21, 2025, fact-checking claims made by Donald Trump regarding Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article states that in a February 2, 2025, interview with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s military has received only a portion of the billions in US aid earmarked for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Zelenskyy cited a total of $177bn or $200bn spent by the US and said Ukraine had not received about $100bn of that total. <image:0> The article also mentions that the Kiel Institute for the World Economy estimates the US sent about $120bn as of December. The article also states that the official amount spent by the US on Ukraine is $183bn.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/): 
Content: Pravda.com.ua reports that in an interview with the Associated Press, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine has received about US$76 billion of the approximately US$177 billion in aid approved by the US. <image:3378>. The article also mentions that in November 2024, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine has not received even half of the weapons officially allocated by the United States. The article was published on February 2, 2025.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: Zelenskyy stated in a February 2, 2025, AP interview that Ukraine had received only a portion of the US aid, citing figures of $177 billion or $200 billion spent by the US, with Ukraine receiving approximately $76 billion ([Izvestia](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked), [Pravda.com.ua](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)). While this supports the portion of the claim regarding the receipt of partial aid, the evidence does not support the assertion that this confirms the aid is a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
