## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ben Stiller met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on June 20, 2022, as part of his visit as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) according to ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989)). The New York Post also reported on the meeting ([https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/](https://nypost.com/2022/06/20/ben-stiller-met-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-on-world-refugee-day/)). The BBC also reported on the meeting ([https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-61875351)).

### Evidence from `web_search`
Ben Stiller refuted claims that his trip to Ukraine was funded by USAID, stating that he self-funded his humanitarian trip. The claims were amplified by Elon Musk and originated from a video released in February 2025. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed that Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel.

## Elaboration
The claim that Ben Stiller received $4 million from USAID for his meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky is false. Evidence indicates that Stiller's trip was self-funded, and he refuted claims that USAID funded his trip. The meeting did take place on June 20, 2022, as the image suggests.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially false. While the image and the meeting date are accurate, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is demonstrably false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially false. While the image accurately depicts Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelensky meeting on June 20, 2022, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is false. Multiple sources, including [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb), confirm that Stiller self-funded his trip and denied the claims.
