This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

Keyword searches found a similar claim has circulated since 2023, which has been [debunked](https://mythdetector.ge/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)
 by other fact-checking organizations, including Myth Detector based in Georgia.

Dafina Kandova, a journalist with the Bulgarian checking organization factcheck.bg, told AFCL that her organization had [checked](https://factcheck.bg/ne-e-vyarno-che-amerikanskata-kompaniya-blackrock-zabranyava-na-ukrajna-da-pogrebva-ubitite-si-vojnici-si-v-grobishta/)

 similar rumors circulating in Bulgaria at the end of 2023.

Dafina added that while Plamen Paskov often appears as a commentator for the Bulgarian nationalist Ataka party, he is not actually an official member of the party and has not been elected to public office.

Paskov’s popularity is largely built on social media, gaining followers by spreading conspiracy theories related to hot topics such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, she added. 6, 2024.

“BlackRock purchased 47% of Ukraine’s arable lands … BlackRock has asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers and look for other ways to take care of them because it wants to use the lands in a different way,” reads the claim in part.

Zhao cited a Bulgarian politician named Plamen Paskov whose claim about BlackRock's land ownership in Ukraine was previously [shared](https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20240802/1060759436.html)
 by Russia's state-run Sputnik news agency.

The same claim was shared on other Chinese websites as seen [here](https://user.guancha.cn/main/content?id=1280544)

‘In an article published in early August, Russian and Chinese media quoted a purported Bulgarian politician as saying that U.S. The New York-based multinational asset manager has a big enough stake in many influential companies worldwide to push them to change decisions and priorities.

According to a Ukrainian government [press release](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-obgovoriv-z-generalnim-direktorom-blackrock-koordi-80105)
, President Volodymyr Zelensky met BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss how Ukraine could raise national reconstruction funds at the end of 2022.

In May 2023, the Ukrainian government [signed](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-proviv-zustrich-iz-kerivnictvom-najbilshoyi-u-svit-82725)
 an agreement with BlackRock to provide support services to the Ukraine Development Fund in order to attract funds to rebuild the economy after the war ends.

But the claim about BlackRock’s land ownership in Ukraine and its request to the government regarding deceased soldiers is false.

Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are [prohibited](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC043459/)
 from purchasing arable land.

“Agricultural land cannot be transferred (allotted) to foreigners, stateless persons, foreign legal entities and foreign states,” reads the Article 22 of Ukraine’s Land Code (No. BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine.”

 [! The posts state that the creator of this fund, Larry Fink, who is the head of the American corporation BlackRock, banned the burial of dead Ukrainian soldiers on this land, because “unsustainable waste of valuable arable land” is inappropriate.

Identical posts were published by Russian-language users ([1](https://www.facebook.com/100050002686731/videos/2243608662643791)

) on May 12. Ukrainian legislation prohibits foreign companies from purchasing agricultural land.**

Russian director, actor, and propagandist Nikita Mikhalkov also voiced the claim that Larry Fink, the co-founder and CEO of the American company BlackRock, forbade the burial of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war on Ukrainian soil. The claim that Ukraine was sold to the mentioned company is a Russian propaganda narrative, which is also [voiced](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/kyiv-has-sold-ukraine-to-blackrock-russia-lambasts-ukraine-for-taking-support-from-us/videoshow/106731755.cms?from=mdr)
 by Russian high-ranking officials.

It is also false to claim that international corporations have bought 17 million hectares of Ukrainian land. For more details, see:

[![Русскій фейк, іді на***!](https://disinfo.detector.media/images/client/podcast_en.jpg?v1.0)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%B9-%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BA-%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%96-%D0%BD%D0%B0/id1613169454)

Propagandists are spreading information on social networks that 47% of Ukraine's territory belongs to BlackRock, and that company representatives came to Kyiv and asked not to bury the dead soldiers on their lands. The author of the post claims that the CEO of BlackRock allegedly advised Ukraine not to pollute arable land with the bodies of dead soldiers and to use crematoriums. They found that the claim that BlackRock banned Ukraine from burying its military is wrong. According to the press service of the President of Ukraine, in late 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyi held a remote meeting with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, during which they discussed possible projects to help structure funds for the country's recovery. In addition, about 70% of Ukraine's territory is agricultural land. Successful partnerships between Ukraine and international companies, such as BlackRock, could become a tool for post-war reconstruction. By spreading such fakes, propagandists try to demoralize the population of Ukraine, creating the impression that even burying fallen defenders could become a problem due to the loss of control over national lands. In 2023, the Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund designed to attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment to restore the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military. The largest companies controlled only 16% of agricultural land, or about 6.45 million hectares. There are more than 10 foreign agricultural companies operating in the country, owning about 3-4 million hectares of land."

Russian Federation’s Attack on Ukrainian Children’s Hospital ‘Not Only a War Crime’ but ‘Far Beyond the Limits of Humanity’, Medical Director Tells Security Council
====================================================================================================================================================================

‘There Has Been No Respite for Civilians in Ukraine’, Says Humanitarian Official

Amid a wave of the Russian Federation’s deadly missile attacks, targeting multiple cities across Ukraine on 8 July — including a strike that hit the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv — the United Nations top humanitarian official warned against a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health-care and other civilian infrastructure.

“There has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine”, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, adding that she was “shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”.  In Kyiv, the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital were severely damaged, and its toxicology department — where children receive dialysis — was destroyed.  “Russia started this war and Russia can end it at any time”, she underscored, reaffirming support for Ukraine.

The representative of the United Kingdom said that, in its repeated attacks against Ukraine since 23 February 2022, the Russian Federation has killed, maimed and abducted Ukrainian children.  Further, on 8 July, it attacked a children’s hospital. “This is cowardly depravity, and this must stop”, she underscored, stating that the intentional direction of attacks against civilian populations and objects constitutes a war crime. Stressing that Moscow’s conduct “is a disgrace to the Security Council and, especially, to the President’s seat”, she urged those present to jointly condemn the Russian Federation’s actions. For its part, the United Kingdom and its partners “will continue to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself from these barbaric acts of violence” and — at the ongoing summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — “will demonstrate our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes”.  Moscow must end its aggression against Ukraine and withdraw its forces.  “And stop killing Ukrainian children”, she added.

The representative of Japan lamented that the Council met “once again to confront the grim reality” caused by the Russian Federation’s escalating attacks across Ukraine, including a barrage of missiles that caused serious damage and many casualties at a pediatric hospital in Kyiv.  She wished that the children there would get prompt and appropriate care.  The Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) is verifying figures while rescue workers, hospital staff and volunteers continue to clear rubble in search of people trapped under debris. Health officials report that what remains of the children’s hospital is without electricity, preventing the use of ventilators and other urgent care.  UN Human Rights staff has helped move child patients to other facilities while providing psychosocial support and assisting with other urgent needs. She also highlighted “a massive outpouring of solidarity” from local residents, who rushed to the scene to help remove rubble and provide blankets, water and food for patients and medical staff. Furthermore, at least seven civilians were killed at the ISIDA medical centre in Kyiv — one of Ukraine’s largest women’s health and family planning centres — when debris from an intercepted missile hit the facility.

“Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”, she asserted, adding that these incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health care and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Attacks have intensified since the spring of 2024.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022.  Multilateral efforts that preserve diplomatic frameworks are the best way to achieve concrete solutions, he said.

The representative of Malta, noting that the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital is a beneficiary of the technical cooperation programme run by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that the missile attack against it “not only endangers lives, but also constitutes a violation of IAEA’s core principles and values”.  Health and educational facilities “must always be protected” to ensure uninterrupted delivery of their services to all people in Ukraine, she stressed, calling for the immediate cessation of all attacks against hospitals, residential buildings and critical infrastructure in Ukraine and on all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law.  The attacks on 8 July took place amidst Moscow’s new military offensive in the Kharkiv region, but attacks throughout 2024 have endangered the lives of thousands of children, health-care workers and civilians. Against that backdrop, she stressed: “The perpetrators of these actions must be held accountable for the damage done.”

The representative of Mozambique said that civilian deaths, both intentional and incidental, must not be condoned, urging warring parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  The respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be upheld under any circumstance.  Okhmatdyt Hospital was just one of many targets in the heavy missile strike which hit Kyiv and other cities on 8 July, he said, noting that the Russian Federation launched 38 missiles, attacking almost 100 civilian sites.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022, she asserted that “intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”.

Describing the 8 July attack on the children’s hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir, the Director of Okhmatdyt, said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  “At 10:42 a.m.  Describing the 8 July attack on the facility, he said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  Noting ongoing negotiations regarding Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee deep in children's blood in the chair’s seat here?”  The representative of the Russian Federation will bypass purgatory and end up in hell forever, he said, calling on the Council to respond to that country’s aggression and war crimes as well as address the issue of its presence in the permanent seat of the Soviet Union.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that the Russian Federation’s recent large-scale missile attacks are “a stark reminder” of why the Russian Federation Armed Forces are listed by the UN as a perpetrator of grave violations against children.  He stressed: “By targeting Okhmatdyt — a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine — Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and its utter insincerity about peace talks.”  Further, he pointed to the “striking paradox” of a Member State currently holding the presidency of the Council — the organ responsible for maintaining peace and security — while intensifying, “as we speak”, attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  Citing an OHCHR report documenting Moscow’s targeting of energy infrastructure and use of “double-tap” strikes, he stressed:  “These are the facts.”

Against that backdrop, he underscored that the Russian Federation and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression and for other serious international crimes — “as well as for the massive damage caused by their war”.  The General Assembly will soon vote on a resolution regarding the threats posed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as this marks the first time in history that a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been illegally seized by a foreign aggressor.  “History matters here”, he stressed, stating that history — including the 1986 Chernobyl disaster — teaches the existential importance of nuclear safety and security. “Russia’s irresponsible actions place all of us at risk, and that is why we hope — and expect — that all UN Member States will support this initiative”, he urged.

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation forces have targeted the largest Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia, the largest Ukrainian water dam in Khakovka and now Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in Kyiv.  He cited estimates by media experts that the Kremlin spent as much as $250 million on Monday’s missile barrage against targets in several Ukrainian cities.  Instead of using the money to treat their own children, Moscow “prefers to spend hundreds of millions on killing children in Ukraine”.  “We must move from the logic of domination and force to the logic of diplomacy and the peaceful solution of the conflict”, he said.

Along similar lines, the speaker for Sierra Leone underlined that the devastating impact of the reported overnight missile strikes on civilians is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the violence to end and a renewed commitment to protecting civilian lives and infrastructure in conflict zones.  “It also begs for independent investigations”, he said, urging the involved parties to “choose and prioritize peace”.

On 8 July, Moscow deliberately targeted “perhaps the most vulnerable and defenceless group in any society — children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses”, said Ukraine’s delegate.  Holding up images of the missile’s flight trajectory, as well as pictures of missile fragments retrieved from under the hospital, he said the footage shows that the hospital was a deliberate target.  Turning to ongoing negotiations regarding the Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee-deep in children’s blood in the Chair’s seat here?”

Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to counter that a missile from the Ukrainian air defence hit the children’s hospital in an attempt to intercept a Russian missile that was meant to hit a factory.  He pointed out that this tragedy — which falls within the pattern of Ukrainian and Western propaganda — occurred on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit.  “If this was a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building and all the children would have been killed and not wounded”, he said, emphasizing that Moscow does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Briefings

JOYCE MSUYA, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that, since June, “there has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine” amid continuing waves of attacks across the entire country.  “I was particularly shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”, she stated.  These attacks struck vital energy infrastructure, as well as two of the country’s leading specialist hospitals for children and women."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image search results show the aftermath of the attack, with significant damage to the hospital. The claim suggests that the toys in the image were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether the toys were indeed photoshopped into the image. This could be done by analyzing the image for signs of manipulation or by comparing it to other images of the scene.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim due to insufficient information.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Kyiv pediatric hospital attack July 8 2024")

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 8, 2024, Russian forces attacked multiple cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, resulting in at least 42 civilian deaths, including five children, and 190 injuries. The Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv was severely damaged in the attack. The United Nations and various countries condemned the attacks, describing them as a war crime. The Russian Federation claimed that a Ukrainian missile hit the hospital.

The Wikipedia article on the 8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine, which targeted Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk, mentions the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv being hit. The image <image:8>

### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour reported on a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital (<image:8051>). The Guardian published an article about the Russian bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024 (<image:8053>).

The sources are: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image search results show the aftermath of the attack, with significant damage to the hospital. The claim suggests that the toys in the image were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether the toys were indeed photoshopped into the image. This could be done by analyzing the image for signs of manipulation or by comparing it to other images of the scene.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim due to insufficient information.

Russian Missile Identified in Kyiv Children’s Hospital Attack
=============================================================

July 9, 2024

*   [Missile](/tag/missile)
    
*   [Russia](/tag/russia)
    

An analysis of open source evidence, as well as missile experts, have pointed to a Russian launched Kh-101 cruise missile being the weapon that struck a children’s hospital in Kyiv, debunking claims from pro-Russian accounts and actors that denied responsibility and sought to shift the blame for the incident on to Ukraine.

The July 8 attack on the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital [killed two](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/7qtQnWmyiTiwJ19F/)
 and injured over 50 others, according to the hospital. However, the full toll of dead and injured remains unknown with individuals [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/rescuers-search-rubble-of-kyiv-childrens-hospital-after-russian-missile-attack-in-ukraine)
 to still be trapped under rubble.

In the aftermath of the strike, several social media accounts known for spreading disinformation — including that of the [Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://x.com/mfa_russia/status/1810307880244965438)
 — began to claim that the missile was American-made and that it had been launched from a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system. 

Yet an analysis conducted by Bellingcat using social media footage as well as  a 3D model of the missile, all point to the munition being a [Russian Kh-101 cruise missile](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/kh-101-kh-102/)
. <image:8055>

The video clearly captured the missile that impacted the hospital. Note that the two share identical proportions, as well as the presence of a jet engine at the rear of the missile and two wings near the middle part of the missile’s body (Source: Michael Sheldon/_[_Telegram_](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56581)

A video overlay of the two images above also demonstrates the matching the features and proportions of the 3D model of the Kh-101 and the missile that hit the hospital.

Missile Remnants
----------------

After the strike, the SBU [released three images](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/slidchi-sbu-vstanovyly-shcho-rf-udaryla-po-okhmatdytu-raketoiu-kh101)
 claiming to show remnants of the munition that hit the hospital. The reference image from the manual has another piece that gives a more complete look at the serial number (Source [_Ukraine Territorial Defense Forces_](https://sprotyvg7.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4.%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA.-%D0%86%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%84.-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82.pdf)

Additionally, one of the images released by the SBU shows markings on another remnant of the missile that hit the hospital. <image:8064>

On July 8, Russia [launched](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-mass-russian-missile-strike-kills-dozens-across-ukraine/)
 a massive missile attack on Ukraine, including on the “Okhmatdit” children’s hospital in Kyiv. The video also indicates that the missile was not damaged before hitting the hospital.

The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission, Danielle Bell, made a similar [assessment](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/un-assessment-suggests-ukraine-childrens-hospital-hit-by-russian-missile-2024-07-09/)
 and said that according to the mission’s analysis, the attack on the hospital was most likely the result of a direct attack by the Russian side.

> **Danielle Bell**: “Analysis of the video footage and an assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children’s hospital suffered a direct hit rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapon system.”

 and the Institute for the Study of War have [identified](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-july-8-2024?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2K_apLv45ofZ9n456TeGHoyn-br1nh9nh6xzT6X3gHUFuCWUothFhNxDo_aem_9xM-8tChDFExodQf1GasFg)
 different narratives circulating in Kremlin sources regarding the attack on the hospital:

*   Ukrainian soldiers are being treated in the children’s hospital/the hospital is actually a military hospital
*   Military material was stored in the hospital
*   An important strategic meeting was taking place on the territory of the hospital
*   The hospital was specifically damaged by the Ukrainian Air Defense Forces in order to obtain Western funding for the continuation of the war
*   The Russian target was the Artem plant, 1.6 kilometers from the hospital

The Institute for the Study of War points out that the widespread claims contradict the existing facts. In addition, the institute points out, the military hospital is not a legitimate target during the war, and the false narrative that the military was being treated in Okhmatdit or that it was a military hospital still cannot justify the Russian attack.

After the start of a full-scale invasion in Ukraine, the Russian side repeatedly evaded its responsibility for the casualties, for example, Kremlin sources [denied the Bucha massacre](https://mythdetector.com/en/kremlin-propaganda-and-georgian-facebook-accounts-deny-the-bucha-massacre/)
 and [blamed Kyiv](https://mythdetector.com/en/alt-info-s-disinformation-about-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war/)
 for the attack on the Olenivka prison.

# Instructions
You just retrieved web sources, each one summarized under "Web Sources". **Your task right now is to summarize the web source summaries.**

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Kyiv pediatric hospital attack July 8 2024")
image_search("Kyiv pediatric hospital attack")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 8, 2024, Russian forces attacked multiple cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, resulting in at least 42 civilian deaths, including five children, and 190 injuries. The Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv was severely damaged in the attack. The United Nations and various countries condemned the attacks, describing them as a war crime. The Russian Federation claimed that a Ukrainian missile hit the hospital.

The Wikipedia article on the 8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine, which targeted Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk, mentions the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv being hit. The image <image:8>

### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour reported on a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital (<image:8051>). The Guardian published an article about the Russian bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024 (<image:8053>).

The sources are: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image search results show the aftermath of the attack, with significant damage to the hospital. The claim suggests that the toys in the image were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether the toys were indeed photoshopped into the image. This could be done by analyzing the image for signs of manipulation or by comparing it to other images of the scene.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim due to insufficient information.


## Actions
```

Content: Detector Media states that pro-Russian sources claimed the photographs of the State Emergency Service from the Okhmatdyt children's hospital attack on July 8, 2024, were fake. However, Detector Media found no evidence of manipulation in the area of the toys in the image <image:8>. The toys are also visible in other photos and videos from the scene. The article mentions that the image was shared by American blogger Jackson Hinkle, who claimed the Ukrainian government inserted fake toys into the image. The article suggests using the InVID & WeVerify tool to check if the photo has been altered.

* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 8, 2024, Russian forces attacked multiple cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, resulting in at least 42 civilian deaths, including five children, and 190 injuries. The Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv was severely damaged in the attack. The United Nations and various countries condemned the attacks, describing them as a war crime. The Russian Federation claimed that a Ukrainian missile hit the hospital.

The Wikipedia article on the 8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine, which targeted Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk, mentions the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv being hit. The image <image:8>

### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour reported on a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital (<image:8051>). The Guardian published an article about the Russian bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024 (<image:8053>).

The sources are: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The image search results show the aftermath of the attack, with significant damage to the hospital. The claim suggests that the toys in the image were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether the toys were indeed photoshopped into the image. This could be done by analyzing the image for signs of manipulation or by comparing it to other images of the scene.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim due to insufficient information.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the toys in the image of the Kyiv pediatric hospital attack were photoshopped is not supported by the evidence. While the attack on the hospital on July 8, 2024, is confirmed by multiple sources, including the [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital), there is no definitive proof to verify the claim. Pro-Russian sources have alleged the image is fake, specifically regarding the toys, but this does not constitute proof.

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

----------- A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)

The French president Emmanuel Macron caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus on the matter.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the case on Monday (9 December) for a diplomatic settlement to Russia's war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the NATO military alliance.

The remarks at a joint press conference with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz were the latest to signal Kyiv's increasing openness to war negotiations, with Donald Trump preparing to return to the White House on 20 January.

The UNS president-elect, who has said he wants to end the war quickly, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations to end the "madness", after he met Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron for talks in Paris.

A handout photo made available by the Presidential Press Service of Ukraine shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (3-L) holding a meeting with Friedrich Merz (3-R), Chairman of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, during their meeting in Kyiv, 9 December 2024. He suggested that some part of troops of a country be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee us security while Ukraine is not in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

"But we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO," he added.

Kyiv, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join NATO, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion once the current hostilities are halted.

"If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had the invitation, and we would not be in NATO, and there will be a pause, then who guarantees us any kind of security?" Zelenskyy asked at the press conference.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon its NATO ambitions and sees Kyiv's membership of the alliance as an unacceptable security threat.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping to call outgoing US President Joe Biden in the coming days to discuss NATO membership.

December meeting with allies
----------------------------

Zelenskyy's spokesperson Serhiy Nikiforov said later that Kyiv was preparing a December meeting of key European partners who together with the US were "capable of ensuring the maximum strengthening of our state".

The aim was to develop a joint position that would hold strong both in negotiations and on the battlefield, he added.

Zelenskyy said he had discussed a "freezing" of the lines in the war when he met Macron and Trump. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," Zelenskyy said.

[Euractiv.com with Reuters](https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractiv-com-with-reuters/) Dec 10, 2024 06:45 4 min. Russia controls nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory after launching the 2022 invasion that unleashed the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Zelenskyy said he told the two leaders that he did not believe Putin actually wanted to end the war and that the Russian president had to be forced to make peace.

"You can only exert force if Ukraine is strong. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield," he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

He received a rhetorical boost from Merz, the frontrunner in the election race to become Germany's next chancellor, who used his visit to liken Berlin's current policy to making Ukraine fight with one arm tied behind its back.

Foreign troops
--------------

Zelenskyy also returned to an idea raised in February by Macron, who floated the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine. There was no consensus on the matter among the European leaders.

Zelenskyy says he is open to negotiated end to war with Russia
==============================================================

December 09, 2024 6:14 PM

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with Friedrich Merz, chairman of the German Christian Democratic Party, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Dec. We do seek it," the Ukrainian president said Monday at a joint press conference in Kyiv with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz.

Zelenskyy also said he is open to the possibility of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine to help his country end its war with Russia, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly three years.

"But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

On his Telegram channel, the Ukrainian leader said the deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a step forward for the Eastern European country’s quest to join NATO.

Zelenskyy’s openness to a negotiated end to the conflict with Russia and the presence of Western troops in Ukraine coincides with Russia’s recent gains in Ukraine and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. 9, 2024. President-elect Donald Trump.

Trump met with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he plans to call U.S. President Joe Biden soon about Ukraine joining NATO.

"He is the current president, and a lot rides on his opinion. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today — while he is not yet in the White House,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump has said he wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly and has called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

However, Zelenskyy told the _New York Post_ that while Trump wants a ceasefire, the two leaders have not discussed any details about that arrangement.

Merz, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's challenger in the upcoming German election, said at the joint address with Zelenskyy that the “basic consensus” in Germany is that Germany will continue to supply Ukraine with military aid.

In his meetings with Zelenskyy, Merz did, however, note that Germany’s position on Ukraine differs from the stance that France, the U.S. <image:4700>

​​​​​​​**LONDON**

The Italian Prime Minister said Tuesday she understands the US approval of the use of long-range missiles for Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice, according to Italian news agency, ANSA.

Giorgia Meloni told reporters at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that the US decision was a "response" to Russia's war against Ukraine.

She said, however, that Italy pledges "support" for Ukraine as long as there is a war there.

US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response that the use of Western missiles by Ukraine may be considered an attack by a non-nuclear state with nuclear support, potentially justifying Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

Moscow has revised its nuclear doctrine, reducing the barriers to deploying nuclear weapons in a conflict. 

"We have always been focused on the issue of anti-aircraft defense," said Meloni. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. "Of course, I understand the point of view of other nations."

Meloni noted that hunger and poverty are far from being solved.

"We are very far from solving” those issues, “given the ongoing crises, in Ukraine where Russia has used wheat as a weapon, and in the Middle East," she noted.

Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil’s key negotiator at G20, told reporters earlier this month that Lula's launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday is just as important as the final statement. Biden’s administration announced plans last year to give $500 million.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. She commented on the US's decision regarding the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine inside Russia. However, the evidence does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

The available information suggests that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's position while Italy made a different choice.

To verify the claim, information about Meloni's specific statements regarding the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit is missing.

*   **Ukraine’s president, [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
    , did not directly confirm the missile attack targeting Bryansk** but said: “We now have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.”
    
*   **Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the Ukrainian attack was a clear signal that the west wanted to escalate the conflict.** “Without the Americans, it is impossible to use these hi-tech missiles, as Putin has repeatedly said,” Lavrov said in Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit. The Hlukhiv attack late on Monday night reportedly killed nine civilians, including a child, it said.

“Violations of human rights have become the order of the day, both in the conduct of hostilities and in areas under occupation,” Laurence said.

“The violence must stop – for the sake of the people of Ukraine, the people of [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
, and the world.”

Turkey’s president **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan** has signalled that he does not support the US’s decision to allow [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 to fire US-made missiles inside Russia.

 Erdoğan said Moscow had to take steps to protect itself, adding that Nato should review the Russian statement carefully.

Speaking at a press conference after the G20 summit in Brazil, he said Turkey had to maintain good relations with both [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and Ukraine.

Ankara would continue to call for peace despite Ukraine’s attack on Russia using US Atacms missiles, which he said was “not positive”.

**Denmark** is making a new donation of about $138m (£109m) for development of Ukraine’s arms industry, the country’s prime minister **Mette Frederiksen** said on Tuesday.

“Today I’m pleased to announce a new Danish donation to Ukraine. And make no mistake, our support is long-term.”

Denmark is among the biggest contributors of military aid to Ukraine relative to the size of its economy, with much of the aid directed specifically at developing Ukraine’s defence industry.

 from the UK prime minister, **Keir Starmer,** who was speaking to reporters during the G20 summit in Brazil today.

Starmer said Russian leader **Vladimir Putin**’s “irresponsible rhetoric” on nuclear weapons is “not going to deter our support for Ukraine”.

“We’re now on day 1,000 of a conflict, that’s 1000 days of Russian aggression, 1,000 days of sacrifices in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)

The UK’s prime minister **Keir Starmer** has said that Russia was guilty of making “irresponsible rhetoric” [after Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-673c4f4f8f0866cddf1b79ee#block-673c4f4f8f0866cddf1b79ee)
.

“There’s irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia, and that is not going to deter our support for [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
,” he told reporters at the G20 summit in Brazil.

Speaking about [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 in general, he said: “One nation stands apart. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was “not surprised” by comments by the Kremlin over the new revised nuclear doctrine.
    
*   **The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, also accused Russia of being guilty of making “irresponsible rhetoric”.** “There’s irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia, and that is not going to deter our support for Ukraine,” he told reporters at the G20 summit in Brazil. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said at the G20 summit that the UK recognised it needed to “double down” on its support for Ukraine,
    
*   **The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, marked the “grim” milestone of 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine** by saying that it has been “1,000 days too many of senseless pain and suffering.” A statement by Türk’s spokesperson on Tuesday said the OHCHR has verified that at least 12,162 civilians have been killed since 24 February 2022, among them 659 children. Get out of Ukraine’.”

!Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer arriving for a press conference as he attends the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He is the author of his own exile.”

He declined to say whether he was disappointed that the G20 joint communique watered down support for Ukraine (it only included a broad reference to “human suffering” caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion).

Asked whether he was disappointed, Starmer said: “The communique does be absolutely clear on the UN charter and sovereignty and territorial integrity and obviously that’s negotiated by quite a sort of diverse group.”

He insisted that he had used “every opportunity” both in the main sessions and in bilateral meetings during the summit to make clear “what we need to do to double down”.

Under four schemes announced by the EU’s European Defence Agency (EDA), groups of European countries have signed so-called letters of intent to develop to work together to develop missile defence, electronic warfare and other military assets as part of a drive to foster closer defence cooperation between national governments.

“National efforts, while indispensable, are not enough,” **Josep Borrell**, the EU’s outgoing top foreign policy chief, said.

“The geopolitical landscape makes our cooperation, alongside increased spending, essential to be ready for high-intensity warfare.”

From 19 Nov 2024

The **US** has not seen any reason to adjust its nuclear posture, a spokesperson for the state department said after [Russia lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-673c4f4f8f0866cddf1b79ee#block-673c4f4f8f0866cddf1b79ee)

**Matthew Miller,** at a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, said Moscow’s “irresponsible and bellicose” rhetoric “will not do anything to improve Russia’s security”.

He said he was “not surprised” by comments by the Kremlin over the new revised nuclear doctrine, which allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.

“Since the beginning of its war of aggression against [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
, it has sought to coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior,” Miller said.

“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, but we will continue to call on Russia to stop this bellicose and the irresponsible rhetoric.”

## Claim
Claim: "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Giorgia Meloni G20 summit Rio de Janeiro November 2024 Russia Ukraine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2024 G20 summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from November 18–19, 2024, with the theme "Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet" (<image:0>, [Source](https://katv.com/news/nation-world/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-hosts-g20-summit-amid-global-tensions-ukraine-russia-israel-hamas-war-and-donald-trumps-election-victory-fighting-hunger-president-luiz-incio-lula-da-silva-joe-biden-white-house) and [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)). Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy, attended the summit ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)).

Anadolu Agency reported that Meloni stated she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. She commented on the US's decision regarding the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine inside Russia. However, the evidence does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

The available information suggests that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's position while Italy made a different choice.

To verify the claim, information about Meloni's specific statements regarding the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit is missing.

China urges ‘calm’ after Putin decree on broader use of nuclear weapons

Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) greets his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron (R), during the opening of the G20 Summit of Heads of State in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 18 November 2024. The previous doctrine, published in 2020, said such an attack must threaten “the very existence of the state,” while the new one puts that threshold at a “critical threat” to Russia’s sovereignty.

Following the decree, a senior official told AFP that a strike on Russia's Bryansk region earlier on Tuesday "was carried out by ATACMS missiles" -- a reference to the US-supplied Army Tactical Missile System.

On Wednesday Beijing called for a cooling of tensions.

"Under the current circumstances, all parties should remain calm and exercise restraint, working together through dialogue and consultation to ease tensions and reduce strategic risks," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said when asked about the decree and the strikes inside Russia.

"China's stance of encouraging all parties to de-escalate the situation and commit to a political resolution of the Ukraine crisis remains unchanged," Lin added.

"China will continue to play a constructive role in this regard," he said.

The White House, UK and European Union condemned Putin's nuclear decree as "irresponsible".

Speaking to journalists after the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, French leader Emmanuel Macron said he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting at the G20 to "use all his influence" with Putin to try to achieve a de-escalation.

Macron said Russia ally China had "the capacity to negotiate with President Putin so that he halts his attacks" on Ukraine.

China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.

But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war, which it has never condemned.

China on Wednesday (20 November) urged "calm" and "restraint" after Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a nuclear threat and Ukraine fired longer-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.

Moscow has reacted furiously to a decision by US President Joe Biden to change policy on Ukraine and allow Kyiv to use US-supplied long-range missiles to strike Russian territory for the first time.

On Tuesday, Putin signed a decree that enables Moscow to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states such as Ukraine if they are supported by nuclear powers.

[The 7-page decree](http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/files/ru/KrzVeeTCkT05CCvgIoY03xuvIdkVslkx.pdf)
 raises the possibility that nuclear weapons could be used against a nuclear-armed country that doesn’t directly launch an attack on Russia but supports one by a nonnuclear country. Macron said he had asked his Chinese colleague Xi Jinping during a meeting at the G20 to "use all his influence" with Putin to try to achieve a de-escalation. <image:8135>](https://thetrustproject.org/)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2024 G20 summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from November 18–19, 2024, with the theme "Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet" (<image:0>, [Source](https://katv.com/news/nation-world/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-hosts-g20-summit-amid-global-tensions-ukraine-russia-israel-hamas-war-and-donald-trumps-election-victory-fighting-hunger-president-luiz-incio-lula-da-silva-joe-biden-white-house) and [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)). Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy, attended the summit ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)).

Anadolu Agency reported that Meloni stated she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. She commented on the US's decision regarding the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine inside Russia. However, the evidence does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

The available information suggests that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's position while Italy made a different choice.

To verify the claim, information about Meloni's specific statements regarding the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit is missing.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. While she commented on the US's stance on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles, there is no evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Further searches also failed to provide any evidence of such condemnation.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the absence of any mention of Meloni condemning the bombing, the claim is considered false. `false`

However, the evidence does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

The available information suggests that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's position while Italy made a different choice.

To verify the claim, information about Meloni's specific statements regarding the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit is missing.


## Actions

web_search("Giorgia Meloni G20 summit Rio de Janeiro November 2024 condemnation US Ukraine Russia bombing")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates)) reported on the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, mentioning Keir Starmer and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but not Giorgia Meloni. Euractiv ([Source](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/china-urges-calm-after-putin-decree-on-broader-use-of-nuclear-weapons/)) discussed the summit, focusing on discussions between Macron, Xi Jinping, and Putin, and China's call for calm. The Bloomberg source ([Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-11-19/g-20-summit-in-rio-de-janeiro-nov-19)) provided no content.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results do not contain any information about Giorgia Meloni condemning the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. While she commented on the US's stance on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles, there is no evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Further searches also failed to provide any evidence of such condemnation.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the absence of any mention of Meloni condemning the bombing, the claim is considered false. `false`


## Summary

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

As Snopes has reported [before](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/zelenskyy-us-sons-daughters-war-ukraine/)
, Zelenskyy was talking about a hypothetical situation in which Ukraine losing the war against Russia would lead to a broader conflict resulting in Americans being pulled into fighting. As such, we rate this claim as miscaptioned.

In our past [reporting](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/zelenskyy-us-sons-daughters-war-ukraine/)
, we covered how on [Feb. Furthermore, the clip was shared after Zelenskyy's February 2025 visit to the White House, suggesting his comments were recent, when in fact they were made two years earlier.

Since Trump and Vance's confrontation with Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian leader has [said](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-zelenskyy-military-aid-2ce8b167f0ba948b2b606381192de71d)
 the incident was "regrettable" but he was ready to work under Trump's "strong leadership" for a lasting peace.

19-second video of Zelensky goes viral. See what was edited out

03:03

Washington CNN  — 

A viral video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky takes his remarks out of context to wrongly make it sound like he demanded that Americans send their sons and daughters to fight in the war in Ukraine.

The out-of-context 19-second video has been viewed millions of times on Twitter. It features a clip of Zelensky speaking at a news conference last week as an interpreter translates his words into English as follows: “The US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. Mike Lee of Utah shared former Trump administration official William Wolfe’s tweet of the video in which Wolfe claimed that Zelensky wants “dead Americans on Ukrainian soil.” Lee himself [added](https://twitter.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1630787239427883008?s=20)
 in a tweet on Tuesday night: “Zelensky has no right to presume that our sons and daughters will fight his war. But it’s just inaccurate to depict Zelensky’s “have to send their sons and daughters” remark as a demand that Americans take part in combat on Ukrainian soil.

Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment, and Crowley could not be immediately reached for comment. Rather, he predicted that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient assistance, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization_ [_member countries_](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/nato_countries.htm)
 _in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will have to send troops to defend. Ukraine is not a NATO member._

Lee deleted his tweet after CNN informed his office on Wednesday about how the video was taken out of context.

Zelensky made the comments at a news conference on the anniversary of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine."

Fact-checkers from Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)) and CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) state that Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. VOA News also published an article with the same conclusion ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)).

The remarks were made two years before the alleged February 2025 White House visit. Zelenskyy was discussing a hypothetical scenario where the loss of Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving the U.S. <image:1>, <image:k>, <image:522>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him in the claim. Fact-checkers from Yahoo News, CNN, and VOA News have all refuted the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. The evidence also shows that the alleged statement was made two years before the White House meeting.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Fact-checkers have debunked the statement attributed to Zelenskyy. The statement was made two years before the alleged White House meeting.

`false`

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio takes part in an interview with CNN on Friday.

CNN

US Secretary of State Marco [Rubio told CNN in an exclusive interview](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/rubio-zelensky-apology-trump-cnntv/index.html)

President Donald Trump suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “not a man that wanted to make peace,” while claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin does want to end the war.

The Russian president by contrast, Trump said, “is going to want to make it, he wants to make it, he wants to end it.”

The comments from Trump came after an earlier meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart [devolved into an angry exchange](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/trump-zelensky-vance-oval-office/index.html)
 over the nature of US support and whether Zelensky had shown enough gratitude.

Asked whether he was considering cutting off military aid to Ukraine, Trump responded: “It doesn’t matter what I’m considering. He also said he was “grateful for the unwavering bicameral and bipartisan support.”

The US Agency for International Development’s $25 million contribution to an initiative to support Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure against Russian attacks was terminated this week, according to a source familiar.

NBC News was [first to report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/state-department-terminates-us-support-ukraine-energy-grid-restoration-rcna194259)
.

**Some context:** The termination was among thousands foreign assistance awards canceled this week and came ahead of President Donald Trump’s contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The money was for the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, which supports the Ukrainian government’s effort to support and repair their energy infrastructure, which has faced relentless Russian attacks throughout the course of the war.

Although the cancellation occurred before the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelensky, it comes amid a radical shift in policy toward Ukraine that has left some longtime diplomats shocked.

“I’m literally sick to my stomach,” one diplomat told CNN Friday.

“I fear for the fallout,” they said, predicting that “no one in Ukraine will sleep well tonight.”

Merezkho added that the [deal involving Ukraine’s minerals](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-resources-deal-explained-intl-latam/index.html)

“Appeasement doesn’t lead to peace."

Zelenskyy leaves the White House early after Trump meeting gets heated

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)
, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

[!U.S. We're trying to solve a problem."

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

### Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers. 

"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., [said in a statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/28/leader-jeffries-statement-on-white-house-meeting-with-president-zelensky/)

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled."

His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time.

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a trip to the U.S., while former President Donald Trump isn’t, highlighting the growing partisan division over a key foreign policy issue.

Harris is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelenskyy at the White House. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Sept. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”

Zelenskyy had implied that he was going to meet with Trump this week, but Trump's campaign said there had been no formal agreement for a meeting.

Trump has been saying for months, and he has repeated more frequently at rallies this week, that he would immediately end the war in Ukraine — even if it was on terms favorable to Moscow — and he dismissed Zelenskyy as a “great salesman” for securing money for his country who “so badly” wants Democrats to win to keep the money flowing.

“Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,” Trump said Tuesday in Georgia."

She took aim at those who've floated Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

September 26, 2024, 6:13 PM

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged to continue support to Ukraine as she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his so-called "victory plan" to bring an end to war with Russia.

Harris cast the conflict as a fight for fundamental principles of "freedom and independence."

"We also know that other would-be aggressors around the world are watching to see what happens in Ukraine," Harris said. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable," she added.

Harris also appeared to take a swipe at her political opponents -- former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. 26, 2024, in the vice president's ceremonial office inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex.

After sources said Wednesday Trump was not expected to meet with Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon Zelenskyy had asked to meet and that they would do so Friday morning at Trump Tower.

"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly," Trump said. We need to stop the death and destruction."

Zelenskyy has called Vance "too radical," taking issue with his [statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/12/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan/)
 that a Trump-Vance administration's approach to the war would likely include Ukraine ceding territory to Russia and the current line of demarcation becoming a demilitarized zone. Johnson told reporters he would not be in town, but if he had sat down with Zelenskyy, would have aired grievances about his tour of an American munitions manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania.

Zelenskyy made the case to lawmakers for permission to strike deeper into Russia at military targets using U.S.-supplied weapons. Several senators on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire for Biden to give Zelenskyy authorization to do so.

Some Republicans, including JD Vance, have suggested that these actions constitute campaigning for Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. It only mentions that some viewed his actions as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election.

The evidence also mentions that House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars. This suggests that there is a debate over the nature of Zelenskyy's actions and whether they constitute election interference.

To fully verify the claim, more information is needed. Specifically, it would be helpful to know the details of Zelenskyy's statements and actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meeting with Harris. It would also be helpful to know the outcome of the House Republicans' investigation.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race, mentioning a visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024 (<image:2051>, <image:2050>). House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars. See: [https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060](https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060).

NBC News reports that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy at the White House. See: [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648). ABC News reports on Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia (<image:1>, <image:2061>). The article mentions Zelenskyy's visit to Washington and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with Kamala Harris. Some Republicans, including JD Vance, have suggested that these actions constitute campaigning for Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. It only mentions that some viewed his actions as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election.

The evidence also mentions that House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars. This suggests that there is a debate over the nature of Zelenskyy's actions and whether they constitute election interference.

To fully verify the claim, more information is needed. Specifically, it would be helpful to know the details of Zelenskyy's statements and actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meeting with Harris. It would also be helpful to know the outcome of the House Republicans' investigation.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race, mentioning a visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024 (<image:2051>, <image:2050>). House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars. See: [https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060](https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060).

NBC News reports that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy at the White House. See: [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648). ABC News reports on Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia (<image:1>, <image:2061>). The article mentions Zelenskyy's visit to Washington and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers. See: [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-standing-zelenskyy-indirectly-jabs-trump-vance-ukraine/story?id=114219628](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-standing-zelenskyy-indirectly-jabs-trump-vance-ukraine/story?id=114219628).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with Kamala Harris. Some Republicans, including JD Vance, have suggested that these actions constitute campaigning for Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. It only mentions that some viewed his actions as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election.

The evidence also mentions that House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars. This suggests that there is a debate over the nature of Zelenskyy's actions and whether they constitute election interference.

To fully verify the claim, more information is needed. Specifically, it would be helpful to know the details of Zelenskyy's statements and actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meeting with Harris. It would also be helpful to know the outcome of the House Republicans' investigation.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024. During this visit, he thanked the workforce and emphasized the partnership between Ukraine and the U.S. He also met with a Democrat, Matt Cartwright, and was scheduled to meet with President Biden and Vice President Harris. However, the evidence does not show that Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania and met with Kamala Harris, but there is no evidence that he campaigned for her. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with Kamala Harris, there is no evidence to suggest that he was campaigning for her or engaging in election interference. News reports indicate that Zelenskyy's visit was focused on thanking the workforce and emphasizing the partnership between Ukraine and the U.S. [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648) reported on the visit and the political interpretations of it.

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

end of list

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive.

“If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

“In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election,” Musk said, referring to Zelenskyy’s decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion.

“I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this. He will not.”

Musk, one of Trump’s [most powerful allies](/news/2025/2/12/elon-musk-appears-at-white-house-defending-doges-work)
 as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X’s community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

The Tesla CEO, who later on Thursday appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference waving a chainsaw in homage to Argentina’s cost-cutting president Javier Milei, also did not substantiate a claim that widely reported polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology was “Zelensky-controlled” and “not credible.”

Lucas Graves, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches misinformation and disinformation, described Musk’s comments as “extremely concerning”.

“As is often the case with this kind of rhetoric, the accusations are a guide to what we have to look out for from the accuser – a world where private platforms like X can be systematically gamed to favour the political interests and alliances of their owners,” Graves told Al Jazeera.

“A well-designed community notes system can be a useful check on misinformation. X is now relying on it too much, and it is ironic that leadership is now complaining that it isn’t working well.”

Musk’s broadside against Zelenskyy comes as the Ukrainian leader and the Trump administration have been [engaged in a war of words](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 over Washington’s efforts to reach a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” after the Ukrainian leader rejected his claims that Kyiv was to blame for the war and raised concerns about being sidelined in Washington’s negotiations with Moscow.

Trump also claimed that Zelenskyy was “very low” in the polls in his country, echoing his earlier claim that the Ukrainian leader had an approval rating of just 4 percent.

In an opinion poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Wednesday, 57 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy, up five points from December.

The Ukrainian leader’s popularity, however, has waned as the war has gone on, dropping from 90 percent in March 2022 to 64 percent in February last year, according to the institute’s polling.

Since taking control of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has been [heavily criticised](/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 for allowing, and in some cases promoting, misinformation on the platform.

An analysis published by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate found that nearly three-quarters of a sample of false or misleading posts about the 2024 US elections did not display accurate notes correcting the record.

“I think there’s a strong chance that X/Twitter becomes a propaganda arm for Musk/Trump – and, in fact, it’s already happening,” Gordon Pennycook, a professor of psychology at Cornell University who studies misinformation, told Al Jazeera.

“I think Musk wants to reform community notes because he doesn’t like being corrected, as is typical for authoritarian oligarchs.”

 has accused [Volodymyr Zelensky](/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 of “feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers” as the [Trump administration](/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-talks-trump-putin-saudi-arabia-b2699476.html)

The Tesla owner wrote on his X site, without evidence, that Zelensky is “despised by the people of Ukraine” in a post that refuted Kyiv’s claims that the president has a 57 per cent approval rating. Avoid hateful, derogatory, or inflammatory language.”

As _The Independent_ has [reported](/tech/elon-musk-wikipedia-nazi-salute-free-speech-b2685552.html)
, in practice, Musk’s commitment to free speech and fact-based discussion only goes so far.

The billionaire has called for a boycott of Wikipedia in protest at a change to his page regarding his alleged Nazi salute at the Trump inauguration, and he frequently traffics in inaccurate, unsourced, or fully untrue claims on his own X account. Trump later said Zelensky was a “dictator” who had “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left”.

Musk’s post also vowed to “fix” X’s Community Notes feature, after accusing “governments and legacy media” of gaming the crowd-sourced fact-checking feature.

His comments came in response to a post from an anonymous X account, taking issue with the fact that the polling quoted by Mr Zelensky had been published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.

The post claimed that “U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the foreign aid agency that Musk has repeatedly claimed without evidence is a “criminal organization.”

On Thursday Musk took to the stage with Argentinian president Javier Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he held up a chainsaw - replicating a previous stunt by Milei to represent the cuts he planned to government spending.

Trump and Musk have been accused of playing into [Russia](/topic/russia)
’s heavily distorted narrative of its invasion of the country. Because none of this is having a positive effect on Ukraine.”

Indeed, Russian leaders have praised the White House, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying that Trump “[understands our position](/news/world/americas/trump-russia-zelensky-ukraine-war-blame-b2701773.html)

“A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.’ If you'd told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud,” former Russian president [](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE)

Ukrainian and international leaders expressed their support for Zelensky after the claims from Trump and Musk, and argued the White House is playing into Putin’s hands.

“We may like Zelensky, or we may not. His political opponents are routinely jailed or even killed, such as Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov.

Others took issue with Musk’s intention to change Community Notes, a popular fact-checking feature.

“The entire point of the community notes system is that it's independent of the personal views of the people running this platform,” Shayan Sardarizadeh, from the BBC’s Verify team, [wrote](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1892632200333394395)
 on X. “If you start tampering with the system because you personally dislike some notes, then how could users continue to trust it?”

_The Independent_ has contacted X for comment.

Musk, who has long framed himself as a champion of online free speech, has touted Community Notes as an effective tool to maintain factual discourse on X without resorting to top-down speech guidelines.

“Community Notes aims to help all people better understand issues discussed in posts, including people who may hold different viewpoints,” the company’s website reads. unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.”

Experts, including those at the sociology institute, have found that Zelensky has greater than majority support, with a recent survey finding that 57 percent of Ukrainians trusted the president.

Keith Darden, an American University professor who studies Ukraine, [told](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trump-falsely-claims-zelensky-has-a-4-approval-rating-its-above-50/index.html)
 CNN the private institute is considered “the best and most reliable survey organization in Ukraine,” and its findings are quoted in U.S. and Ukrainian media.

![Video Player Placeholder](/img/logo-white-out.svg)

Professor Olga Onuch of The University of Manchester, who regularly conducts survey work in Ukraine, including alongside the sociology institute, has said Trump and Musk’s claims do not reflect the leader’s current support in Ukraine.

“Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic – Zelensky remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine,” she [said](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/trump-is-making-false-claims-about-zelenskys-popularity/)
 in an interview with the university’s website."

! He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he cancelled the election," Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelensky's approval to be just 4%.

"In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election," Musk said, referring to Zelensky's decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow's 2022 invasion.

"I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this. Musk vowed to fix the community notes feature on the platform."

The evidence indicates that Elon Musk made statements on X regarding Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February 2025. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account. Instead, the evidence mentions Musk's criticism of Zelenskyy and his alignment with Donald Trump's views.

The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html)) reported that Musk accused Zelenskyy of "feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers" on X.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Elon Musk made statements on X regarding Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February 2025. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account. The evidence mentions Musk's criticism of Zelenskyy, but not a suspension plan.

`false`

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

    , and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
. 

The Mueller probe catalyzed further inquires by House Democrats in Congress and continues to be mentioned in [discussions on the escalating Ukraine scandal](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/464845-house-lawyer-says-impeachment-probe-could-go-beyond-ukraine)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

# Search Result
From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake. Further in the material about why it is fake.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fake**

As already noted, Russian propaganda actively exploits the topic of mocking Ukraine, Ukrainians and the leadership of the Ukrainian state through fake covers of famous Western publications."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search result from without-lie.info states that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake. The website provides evidence that the magazine did not publish this cover on March 20, 2025, as the serial number 1705 is incorrect. The website also mentions that the real cover of Charlie Hebdo was published on March 19, 2025. <image:14>

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

**A fake Charlie Hebdo cover is being spread on Facebook. Notably, in March 2025, the magazine [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

 [! Consequently, the alleged issue date is also falsified, as the satirical magazine did not publish any issue on March 20. It is noteworthy that after this, the fake cover photo, translated into Italian from Solovyov’s post, was actively shared by Italian-speaking users on social media.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine and started a full-scale war on February 24, 2022, the forging of magazine covers to discredit Ukraine or its leaders has become an active part of Russian disinformation campaigns."

The Russian propaganda systemically releases fake covers of popular magazines, particularly French satirical outlet Charlie Hebdo, to discredit people or events that go against Kremlin policies.

This time, the fake cover supposedly “satirizes” the festival Moldova Pride 2025, which [ran](https://nokta.md/v-kishinjove-s-10-po-15-ijunya-projdjot-lgbt-festival-moldova-pride/)
 from June 10 to June 15 in Chișinău. Since 1991 — after the dissolution of the USSR — the country is officially called Republica Moldova, and that is the name that’s accepted by the UN and all the international documents.

The supposed _Charlie Hebdo_ cover was also shared by the Telegram channel [Kp Moldova](https://t.me/KpMoldova/111962)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/C95P5)
), which is positioned as an unofficial channel of the most popular newspaper in Moldova, and the news piece linking to the post in this Telegram channel was [published](https://md.news-pravda.com/world/2025/06/11/164743.html)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/OZCYg)
) on the website called Pravda Moldova, which is included to the network of pro-Russian online resources that were created to influence foreign audiences.

“That’s a success, Maia! The number on this “issue” of Charlie Hebdo is #1716 for June 10, 2025. 

On Charlie Hebdo’s website in the Unes [section](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
, which keeps an archive of every cover for every issue, we’ve seen that, on June 10, Charlie Hebdo didn’t even publish an issue. The issue #1716 was [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 the next day, on June 11, and its cover looks very different. 

The actual cover contains satire on the Ministry of Internal Affairs of France and the leader of the French conservative party [Bruno Retailleau](https://www.avecretailleau.fr/)
, who is known for its [antimigration](https://ru.euronews.com/2024/10/11/bruno)
 policies and his [statements](https://podcasts.audiomeans.fr/les-4-verites--f4ae1904799b/bruno-retailleau-15-decembre-2021-36364582?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 against LGBT. 

So actually Charlie Hebdo magazine didn’t publish the issue with a cover criticizing the March of Solidarity in Moldova. No, Charlie Hebdo’s cover didn’t ridicule “gay parade” in Moldova  <image:8270>

As for the festival Moldova Pride 2025, it was first [organized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_rights_in_Moldova?utm_source)
 in 2002 and became an annual event (excluding a temporary ban in 2007-2008). <image:8271>](https://bit.ly/476matG "Партнерський банер")

Not registered yet? Charlie Hebdo’s supposed cover from pro-Russian channels’ posts was dedicated to laughing at this march.

!зображення до посту: Debunking Russian fakes. That debunks the thesis of pro-Russian channels that the march is happening because “Moldova is being pulled towards Europe.” 

Moldova’s direction towards the EU was defined later, with the [Union Association Agreement](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE_%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%86%D1%96%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D1%8E_%D0%BC%D1%96%D0%B6_%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%8E_%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%84%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BC_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BC?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 in 2014 and was later written into Moldova’s [constitution](https://monitorul.gov.md/ro/monitor/2985?utm_source)
 after the state-wide referendum on October 20, 2024, in which 50,35% of the population supported defining eurointegration as a “strategic goal.”

Stiller visited Ukraine back in June 2022 as a Goodwill Ambassador to honor World Refugee Day. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person.”

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) [confirmed on its website](https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/speeches-and-statements/statement-goodwill-ambassador-ben-stillers-work-behalf-unhcr)
 that “Ben Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel. Ben has been supporting UNHCR since 2016 and has been a Goodwill Ambassador since 2018. We are grateful for Ben’s longstanding support to refugees and forcibly displaced people.”

The video from February 5 claims that USAID paid **Angelina Jolie** $20 million, **Sean Penn** $5 million, **Jean-Claude Van Damme** (misspelled in the footage) $1.5 million, **Orlando Bloom** $8 million, and **Ben Stiller** $4 million to complete their respective visits to Ukraine.

 Ukrainian president **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** “my hero” during a humanitarian trip to his country, the actor is refuting claims that his travels were funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

“Totally false. News watermark, claims that USAID paid various actors to visit Ukraine and has racked up millions of views since being posted on Wednesday, February 5.

“These are lies coming from Russian media,” Stiller posted on X (formerly Twitter). Untrue,” Stiller wrote alongside a video from an account titled “I Meme Therefore I Am” that has been [reposted](https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1887158413597057107)

 to six misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with the performance of election duties. “I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. In a [video posted to his Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfBeCOoIR5L)
 at the time, Stiller said, “I’m meeting people who’ve been impacted by the war and hearing how it’s changed their lives.

Social-media users viewed the viral footage of the burning Aurus Senat car, which is believed to be worth around $350,000. The incident took place near the headquarters of Russia's main intelligence agency, the FSB, according to reports.

_Newsweek_ has contacted the Kremlin for comment.

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

The video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A £275,000 Aurus Senat limousine, believed to be from Russian President Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, reportedly exploded and caught fire on a street in Moscow near the country's top intelligence agency FSB's headquarters.

 ![A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/30/550x309/KWHEVD2_1708605928909_1743298840432.jpg "A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)")

The incident is said to have taken place on March 29 on a street north of Moscow’s FSB headquarters, located near the Lubyanka, according to EuroWeekly.

A purported video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader amid talks backed by the United States to end Moscow's war in Ukraine.

In the viral video, workers from nearby establishments could be seen helping to extinguish the fire, which is believed to have started from the car's engine bay area and spread to its interiors.

Thick smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, whose front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.

It was not immediately clear who was present in the car during the incident, as no injuries were reported, according to The Sun.

It is suspected that the fire started in the car’s engine and quickly engulfed the entire vehicle, EuroWeekly reported.

### **Ukraine war**

Ukrainian government and military analysts speaking to AP expected Russia to launch a fresh offensive across the 1,000-kilometer front line to strengthen its negotiating position ahead of potential talks with Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeastern regions.

Putin escapes assassination bid? stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

The two sides have stepped up their aerial attacks even as US President Donald Trump pushes them to agree to a ceasefire after more than three years of intense fighting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching commitments to not strike energy facilities.

Zelensky also rejected Putin's idea of a “transitional administration”, backed by the United Nations, in Ukraine and said it was Putin's latest ploy to delay a peace deal.

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

According to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week — suggesting the militants' targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.

"Military leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within U.S operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do," their letter said.

In addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.

From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. **Osamah Abdulrahman/AP** ****hide caption****

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. "These strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders," Eastburn said.

Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation."

CNN  — 

In the month since the US launched a major military campaign targeting the [Houthi rebel group in Yemen](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/middleeast/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthis-may-be-relishing-them-intl/index.html)
, the militants have successfully shot down at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones, hindering the US’ ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, multiple US officials familiar with the matter told CNN.

The US was hoping to achieve air superiority over Yemen within 30 days, officials said and degrade Houthi air defense systems enough to begin a new phase focusing on ramping up intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance of senior Houthi leaders in order to target and kill them, the officials said.

But the platforms best suited to conduct that persistent effort, the MQ9 Reaper drones, keep getting shot down, the officials explained. These assessments were largely based on signals intelligence, one of the people said.

![Yemenis watch a damaged vehicle at Farwah popular market which Houthis said it was struck by US airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, on April 21.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap25111262672128.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Asked for comment about the downed drones and whether it has negatively impacted the operation, a defense official told CNN in a statement that “we are aware of the Houthi reports these MQ-9s have been shot down. The strikes have forced the Houthis to stay underground more and left them in a “confused and disarrayed state,” the officials noted.

But the consistent loss of the drones has made it more difficult for the US to determine precisely how much the US has degraded the Houthis’ weapons stockpiles.

Over the last six weeks, the Houthis have launched 77 one-way attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, 24 medium-range ballistic missiles, and 23 surface-to-air missiles either at US forces, into the Red Sea, or at Israel, two of the officials said.

The intelligence community has also assessed in recent days that over nearly six weeks of US bombing, the Houthis’ ability and intent to keep lobbing missiles at US and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and at Israel is little changed, as is their command-and-control structure, according to two other people familiar with the intelligence. Trump posted on X in March that the Houthis “have been decimated” and their capabilities “are rapidly being destroyed.”

While Eastburn provided additional data on Thursday regarding the impact of US strikes, US Central Command has been largely silent about the impact, however, even as it routinely shares photos and videos on its X account of missiles firing off of warships or US aircraft preparing to launch off aircraft carriers in the Red Sea. The US does not have boots on the ground in Yemen, so it relies on overhead surveillance — much of it from the MQ9s—to conduct battlefield damage assessments and track terrorists.

CNN [reported earlier this month](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 that the US had killed several Houthi officials considered to be mid-level, akin to “middle management,” rather than senior political leadership.

The officials said the US had hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15. “Additionally, Houthi ballistic missile launches have dropped by 87% while attacks from their one-way drones have decreased by 65% since the beginning of these operations.”

The administration is vowing to continue with the campaign until the Houthis can no longer attack Red Sea shipping. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson [last month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/text-of-a-letter-from-the-president-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-and-the-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate/)
, President Donald Trump said the operations would continue “until the Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.”

But the Houthis have long proven to be extremely resilient, burying their equipment deep underground and continuing to receive supplies from Iran. The Pentagon has also not addressed claims by the Houthis that the airstrikes have killed dozens of civilians.

In a rare update, CENTCOM said last week that it had destroyed a port in Yemen that the Houthis were using to import oil and fuel their attacks. But the impact of that on the Houthis’ operations similarly remains unclear.

One of the US officials who spoke to CNN left the door open for a continuous campaign in support of US partners in the Gulf region against the Houthis, similar to how the US operates in Africa.

The costs of the campaign, meanwhile, are only rising. The operation [cost the US nearly $1 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 in just the first three weeks, and the US has continued striking Houthi targets daily for over a month.

The large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who CNN has reported had complained in recent weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM that would be critical in the event of a war with China.

“We have to maintain a high state of indications and warning so we can get those forces back if there is a crisis with greater exigence than there is one in the CENTCOM (area of responsibility),” US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023, including one on December 28, 2024, and another in early 2025. The article also mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR and CNN also report on the Houthis shooting down US Reaper drones. NPR states that the Houthis have shot down seven US Reaper drones in recent weeks. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen) and [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission). The CNN article, published on April 25, 2025, discusses the Houthis' successful targeting of US drones, hindering the US's military campaign. The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `image_search`

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the Houthis have shot down US Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023, including one in early 2025. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

The evidence does not confirm that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025. The image search results show other images of drone crashes, but none of them match the image in the claim. The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel, which contradicts the claim that the drone was shot down by the Houthis in Yemen.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the image's context is not verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the date of the incident.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

An article from NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) suggests that Russian news sites spread false narratives about the fires.

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Putin’s Real _Casus Belli_: Ukrainian Democracy

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

###### Chapter 3: Understanding the Social Acceptability of Structural Reforms

Structural reforms are urgently needed as the world grapples with low growth, demographic shifts, and challenges related to the green and technological transitions. However, notable revisions have taken place beneath the surface since April 2024, with upgrades to the forecast for the United States offsetting downgrades to those for other advanced economies, in particular, the largest European countries. With cyclical imbalances in the global economy waning, near-term policy priorities should be carefully calibrated to ensure a smooth landing."

* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

"The rise in growth reflects a substantial fiscal stimulus, strong investment, and resilient consumption in the context of a tight labour market," the IMF said on Tuesday in its World Economic Outlook, in reference to this year's forecast.

Russia's economy ministry expects gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 2.8% this year, bouncing back from a 2.1% decline in 2022. In its July outlook, the IMF had forecast 1.5% growth.

But the IMF lowered its forecast from 1.3% for 2024, giving Russia the weakest projections in its list of major emerging market and developing economies, for whom average growth this year and next is seen at 4%.

Russia's economy ministry forecasts 2.3% growth next year, while the Bank of Russia's forecast range is 0.5-1.5%.

Oct 10 (Reuters) - Russia's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2024, slower than previously forecast, the International Monetary Fund said, after significant spending and resilient consumption in a stretched labour market support growth of 2.2% this year.

The IMF said Western sanctions on Russian crude oil exports have had mixed effects, with Russian oil now trading above the $60 price cap imposed by the Group of Seven nations.

But Russians likely face double-digit interest rates until at least 2025 and the rouble [tumbled](/markets/currencies/russian-rouble-tumbles-over-18-month-low-vs-dollar-2023-10-09/)
 to over 18-month lows this week on foreign currency outflows. Labour is scarce, with unemployment at record lows, something Putin and the central bank have drawn attention to.

High military spending may help Russia in the short-term, but the economy's long-term prospects are bleak, [economists](/markets/europe/russian-economy-holding-up-road-back-prosperity-may-be-long-2023-02-23/)
 have said, especially as areas like schools and healthcare face effective spending freezes in the years ahead.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

The Developments in Russia Despite the pressure of unprecedented sanctions, the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND FINANCIAL COMMITTEE Fiftieth Meeting October 24–25, 2024 Statement No. Amid complex challenges and numerous risks facing the global economy, the IMF should enhance the effectiveness of its bilateral and multilateral surveillance, assist member countries in strengthening institutional capacities, and continue to refine its lending toolkit. The IMF should fully adhere to its mandate and fulfill its obligations to member countries, as outlined in the Articles of Agreement, to further promote equitable international cooperation for the economic development of all countries. The global public debt-to- GDP ratio continues to rise: it grew from 92.8 percent in 2023 to 93.5 percent in 2024 and is expected to further increase to 94.8 percent in 2025. 2 Geoeconomic fragmentation is increasingly diminishing the efficiency of the global economy. Russia continues to pursue responsible fiscal policy and maintains macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy priorities remain focused on fulfilling all social obligations to the population and enhancing Russia’s defense capacity and technological self-sufficiency. Despite external constraints, by the end of this year, Russia's public debt will be less than 15 percent of GDP and will remain at a safe level in the upcoming three-year period."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.

## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides the World Economic Outlook, October 2024, which includes projections and analysis of the global economy, and also provides a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update. The October 2024 report discusses global growth, policy pivots, and rising threats. (<image:8298>) [https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024)

A Reuters article from October 10, 2023, states that the IMF lowered its forecast for Russia's 2024 GDP growth to 1.1%. (<image:8308>) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/) A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentions that the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF. [https://www.imfconnect.org/content/dam/imf/Spring-Annual%20Meetings/AM/24/IMFCStatePub/IMFC-S-50-24-22%20-%20Stmt%20-%20Mr.%20Siluanov%20-%20Russian%20Federation.pdf](https://www.imfconnect.org/content/dam/imf/Spring-Annual%20Meetings/AM/24/IMFCStatePub/IMFC-S-50-24-22%20-%20Stmt%20-%20Mr.%20Siluanov%20-%20Russian%20Federation.pdf)


## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.

!IMF ranks Russia as world’s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power <image:8326>

**Russia just clinched fourth place on the global economic ladder, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), in new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).**

This makes Russia one of the top contributors to global economic growth, moving ahead of several Western economies. PPP adjusts for price differences across countries, giving more weight to nations with large populations and lower costs of living.

With this [ranking](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/10/24/tr102424-transcript-of-eur-reo)
, Russia now joins China, the U.S., and India in the top four, adding muscle to the economic power of BRICS. This year alone, they’ve met twice, once in Beijing and once at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan.

Putin is also working closely with India, maintaining New Delhi as a strategic ally from the Cold War era despite Russia’s tight relations with India’s rival, China.

Western allies have tried to get Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press Moscow on Ukraine, but he has avoided criticizing [Russia](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russian-crypto-queen-stole-for-ukraine-army/)
, focusing instead on peace and his seemingly close friendship with Putin.

[!World Bank sold $510 million in bonds backed by loans to 57 companies in emerging markets. Over the next five years, the IMF sees China, India, Russia, and Brazil driving growth far more than the Group of Seven (G7), which includes the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

G7 countries, known for their strong GDPs, are now expected to contribute less, with BRICS economies filling in the gap.

### BRICS outpaces G7

Among the BRICS, China is expected to lead the charge, contributing 22% of global growth through 2029 — more than all G7 countries combined. The IMF’s PPP model shows that developing nations, thanks to their populations and relatively lower prices, are playing a stronger role in the global economy.

In surprising detail, the IMF’s numbers illustrate this trend. We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.” When asked about North Korean troops allegedly stationed in Russia, Putin neither confirmed nor denied the reports.

The U.S. Russia wants to sidestep sanctions with an alternative payment network to SWIFT, the global bank messaging system.

In a statement, summit members raised concerns over “unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions” and emphasized the importance of cheaper, safer, transparent, and inclusive cross-border payments.

They committed to reducing trade barriers, ensuring non-discriminatory access, and advancing faster, more efficient payment systems.

The original [BRICS](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/no-new-countries-will-join-brics-putin-says-thats-enough-as-saudi-officially-declines-at-summit/)
 has expanded to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides the World Economic Outlook, October 2024, which includes projections and analysis of the global economy, and also provides a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update. The October 2024 report discusses global growth, policy pivots, and rising threats.

A Reuters article from October 10, 2023, states that the IMF lowered its forecast for Russia's 2024 GDP growth to 1.1%. (<image:8308>) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/) A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentions that the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF.

## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.
