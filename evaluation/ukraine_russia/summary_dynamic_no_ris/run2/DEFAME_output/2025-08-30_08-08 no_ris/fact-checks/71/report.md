## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (![image 2695](media/2025-08-07_21-00-1754600446-931830.jpg)). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides the World Economic Outlook, October 2024, which includes projections and analysis of the global economy, and also provides a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update. The October 2024 report discusses global growth, policy pivots, and rising threats.

A Reuters article from October 10, 2023, states that the IMF lowered its forecast for Russia's 2024 GDP growth to 1.1%. (![image 8308](media/2025-08-30_08-29-1756542592-783560.jpg)) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/) A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentions that the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF.

## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from CryptoPolitan, published on October 25, 2024, states that the IMF ranks Russia as the worldâ€™s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power, based on new data from the IMF (![image 8326](media/2025-08-30_08-32-1756542730-202020.jpg)). The Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, stated at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF ranked Russia as the world's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power. An article from CryptoPolitan, published on October 25, 2024, explicitly states this ranking, based on new data from the IMF. The Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation also referenced the IMF's analysis during the IMFC meeting on October 24-25, 2024.

Therefore, the claim is verified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the IMF did rank Russia as the fourth-largest economy in the world by purchasing power, and this information was available in October 2024. The CryptoPolitan article from October 25, 2024, explicitly states this, based on new data from the IMF. The Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation also referenced the IMF's analysis during the IMFC meeting on October 24-25, 2024.

`true`
