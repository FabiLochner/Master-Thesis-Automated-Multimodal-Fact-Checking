## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a claim that a Fox News article reported that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID (![image 11](media/14.jpg)). One source debunks this claim, stating that the article was not published by Fox News and that the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center. Another source mentions that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The sources also mention that USAID funding to Ukraine in 2024 was for economic and humanitarian projects. The 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center is a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces concerned with psychological and informational warfare.
