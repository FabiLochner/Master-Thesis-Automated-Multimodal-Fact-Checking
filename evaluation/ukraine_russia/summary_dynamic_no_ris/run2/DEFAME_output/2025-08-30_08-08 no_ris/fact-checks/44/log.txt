Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on October 9, 2024, stating that President Joe Biden condemned the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response. The article mentions that Donald Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants. The article also mentions that Trump and JD Vance have highlighted a $750 payment from FEMA to hurricane victims. The article includes images of flooded streets and damage from Hurricane Helene <image:8222>, <image:8226>. The article also mentions that at least 50 helicopters have helped with search and rescue in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene struck <image:8229>.

Content: The search result from Le Monde, published on September 30, 2024, reports on remarks made by US President Joe Biden on the response to Hurricane Helene. <image:8232> Biden announced he would travel to North Carolina to monitor rescue efforts. The article mentions that the death toll from the storm climbed to at least 130.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/fact-focus-a-look-at-the-false-information-around-hurricanes-helene-and-milton/3739451/): 
Content: NBC Washington published an article on October 11, 2024, updated on October 15, 2024, discussing false information surrounding Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The article states that both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris supported recovery efforts. It also mentions that FEMA's disaster relief fund is used for recovery from hurricanes and other disasters and that it funds foreign military aid separately. The article debunks claims that the federal government did not respond to Hurricane Helene and intentionally withheld aid, and that FEMA doesnâ€™t have enough money for hurricane victims because it is being used to help immigrants or going to foreign funding for Israel and Ukraine. <image:8233>, <image:8234>

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. According to a Le Monde article, Biden pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims, contradicting the claim that he announced no further aid would be provided. Additionally, an NBC Washington article debunked false information surrounding the hurricane response, including claims of withheld aid. The search results do not mention any aid for Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
