Content: PBS Frontline World discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The Ukrainian government must do more to clean up its arms exports industry. Ukraine is notorious for its booming legal arms industry. Between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight.

Useful result: From [Source](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/): 
Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The report highlights concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, with criminal groups establishing more organized arms trafficking markets. The report suggests that arms trafficking is likely to be multifaceted, involving both small-scale trade to European organized crime and larger-volume trade to other regions, potentially to conflict actors. The report also mentions that ex-military personnel may form a new class of 'brokers', using connections with other military and politicians to set up larger-scale operations. <image:1112>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/): 
Content: The EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on February 6, 2025, that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine (MoIA) launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking. <image:1115>, <image:1117>, <image:1118>, <image:1120>, <image:1125>. The center aims to counteract illegal arms trafficking, coordinate actions, and exchange information between Ukrainian authorities and partner countries. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime stated that no weapons were trafficked to the European Union due to the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While there is evidence of arms sales and concerns about arms trafficking and corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, the provided sources do not contain any specific figures on the volume of arms sales or the proportion of U.S.-supplied armaments involved.

So, the overall veracity is: false
