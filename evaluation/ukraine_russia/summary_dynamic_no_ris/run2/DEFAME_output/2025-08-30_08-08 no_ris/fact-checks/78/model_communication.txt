You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
geolocate(<image:26>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

 and Russian reserves were rushed to the area.[\[40\]](#cite_note-BBC_Cursino-42)
 By the end of the first week, the Ukrainian military said it had captured 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi) of Russian territory, while Russian authorities acknowledged that Ukraine had captured 28 settlements.[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)

In the second half of August the front stabilized,[\[42\]](#cite_note-forbes_20240911-44)
 and in early October, the Ukrainian advance had stalled.[\[11\]](#cite_note-CNN_Third_Month-12)
 From November, North Korean forces were sent to the province to support the Russian military. By the end of August, the operation began to be criticized for diverting Ukrainian forces from [the east](/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine_campaign "Eastern Ukraine campaign")

 Russian [milbloggers](/wiki/Milblog "Milblog")

According to Russia, at least 1,000 troops crossed the border on the first day, supported by [tanks](/wiki/Tank "Tank")

 According to Andrzej Wilk of the [Centre for Eastern Studies](/wiki/Centre_for_Eastern_Studies "Centre for Eastern Studies")

 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.

Revealed: Russia anticipated Kursk incursion months in advance, seized papers show
==================================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

**Exclusive:** Documents contain months of warnings about possible Ukrainian advance and also reveal concerns about morale

Russia’s military command had anticipated Ukraine’s incursion into its Kursk region and had been making plans to prevent it for several months, according to a cache of documents that the Ukrainian army said it had seized from abandoned Russian positions in the region.

The disclosure makes the disarray among Russian forces after Ukraine’s attack in early August all the more embarrassing. The earliest entries are dated late in 2023, while the most recent documents are from just six weeks before Ukraine launched its incursion into the Kursk region on 6 August.

The documents mostly come from units of Russia’s 488th Guards Motorised Rifle Regiment, and in particular the second company of its 17th Battalion.

Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk took Kyiv’s western partners and many in the Ukrainian elite by surprise, as planning had been restricted to a very small number of people. But Russian military documents contain months of warnings about a possible incursion into the area and an attempt to occupy Sudzha, a town of 5,000 residents that has now been [under Ukrainian occupation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region)
 for more than a month.

An entry from 4 January spoke of the “potential for a breakthrough at the state border” by Ukrainian armed groups and ordered increased training to prepare to repel any attack. It recounts an incident that reportedly took place on 20 January this year, when a conscript soldier entered the summer washing area at a guard post and shot himself in the abdomen.

“The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,” reads the handwritten report of the incident.

To prevent further such incidents, unit commanders are instructed to identify soldiers who “are mentally unprepared to fulfil their duties or prone to deviant behaviour, and organise their reassignment and transfer to military medical facilities”.

Further instructions on keeping up morale come in an undated, typed document that explains that soldiers should get 5-10 minutes a day as well as an hour once a week of political instruction, “aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral and psychological condition of the personnel”.

A Ukrainian armoured personnel carrier in the Sumy region, near the border with Russia’s Kursk region, on 17 August. On 19 February, unit commanders were warned of Ukrainian plans for “a rapid push from the Sumy region into Russian territory, up to a depth of 80km \[50 miles\], to establish a four-day ‘corridor’ ahead of the arrival of the main Ukrainian army units on armoured vehicles”.

In mid-March, units at the border were ordered to boost defensive lines and “organise additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organisation of defences” in preparation for a Ukrainian cross-border attack.

In mid-June, there was a more specific warning of Ukrainian plans “in the direction Yunakivka-Sudzha, with the goal of taking Sudzha under control”, which did indeed happen in August. The June document complained that Russian units stationed at the front “are filled only 60-70% on average, and primarily made up of reserves with weak training”.

When the Ukrainian attack came on 6 August, many Russian soldiers abandoned their positions, and within a week Ukraine had taken full control of Sudzha. The parents of one conscript soldier from the second company, featured in the documents, recorded a [tearful video appeal](https://t.me/mobilizationnews/19909)
 in August, identifying him as their 22-year-old son Vadim Kopylov, saying he had been taken prisoner near Sudzha and calling on Russian authorities to exchange him.

The documents give an insight into Russian tactics over the past year, in one case speaking of the need to create decoy trenches and positions to confuse Ukrainian reconnaissance drones."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

By [John T Psaropoulos](/author/john_psaropoulos_2012510204426705651)

Published On 29 Aug 202429 Aug 2024

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. He also wants to bind EU allies closer in a joint air defence, a defensive measure that wouldn’t provoke Russia, he said, and has already been implemented in protecting Israel from a massive Iranian missile and drone attack on [April 13-14](/news/2024/4/14/iran-attacks-israel-with-over-300-drones-missiles-what-you-need-to-know)
.

After Russia fired 127 missiles and launched 109 Shahed drones into Ukraine on Monday, one of its largest ever aerial attacks targeting energy and civilian infrastructure, Zelenskyy said: “We must finally come to the joint shooting-down of Russian missiles and drones. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug."

## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
geolocate(<image:26>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine incursion into Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One Wikipedia article details the incursion, mentioning the involvement of Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces, the capture of settlements, and the use of tanks and armored vehicles. The Guardian published an article on September 20, 2024, discussing Russia's anticipation of the incursion. Al Jazeera also covered the incursion, mentioning the cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024. The articles include images of tanks and armored vehicles (<image:6630>

## Elaboration
The web search confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as the claim states. The search results mention the use of tanks and armored vehicles during the incursion.

However, the search results do not include the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More evidence is needed to confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the specified incursion.
