The claim '<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including fact-checks from mythdetector.com and The Journal.ie, confirm that the image is a fabricated front page of the Hull Daily Mail. The real front page from March 13, 2025, did not contain the headline about Ukrainian soldiers, as evidenced by the actual front page found via web search.

So, the overall veracity is: false
