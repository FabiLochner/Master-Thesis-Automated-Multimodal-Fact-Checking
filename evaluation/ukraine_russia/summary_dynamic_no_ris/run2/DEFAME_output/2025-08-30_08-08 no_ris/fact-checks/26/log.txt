Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html): 
Content: The Yahoo News fact-check, citing Snopes, states that Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. Instead, he was discussing a hypothetical scenario where the loss of Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving the U.S. The article mentions a clip shared after Zelenskyy's February 2025 visit to the White House, but the comments were made two years earlier. <image:1>. The source is Snopes.

Content: VOA News published an article on March 07, 2023, titled "No, Zelenskyy Did Not Say American Sons and Daughters Will Have to Die in Ukraine" by Nik Yarst. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video): 
Content: CNN published a fact check on March 2, 2023, stating that Zelensky did not say that American sons and daughters will have to fight in Ukraine or die for Ukraine. <image:522> The article explains that a viral video took Zelensky's remarks out of context. Zelensky stated that if Ukraine loses the war, Russia will enter Baltic states, and then the US will have to send troops.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checkers from [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video), and VOA News have debunked the statement attributed to Zelenskyy. The statement was made two years before the alleged White House meeting.

So, the overall veracity is: false
