## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL article from January 8, 2025, fact-checks an image of a Russian passport purportedly belonging to Bashar al-Assad and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The article mentions that Logically Facts debunked the claim. (![image 2651](media/2025-08-07_20-52-1754599946-890665.jpg)) The Wikipedia article discusses the Syrian civil war, including the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and the fall of the Assad regime. It mentions Bashar al-Assad's birthdate (September 11, 1965) and that he fled to Moscow and was granted political asylum in November 2024. (![image 21](media/69.jpg))

NV.ua discusses the arrest of Bashar al-Assad's relatives at Beirut's airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports. It also mentions that Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed and he fled to Moscow. (![image 2674](media/2025-08-07_20-58-1754600338-410139.jpg))


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article on Syrian passports ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_passport)), an image of Syrian passports from Alestiklal.net (![image 8300](media/2025-08-30_08-29-1756542561-725791.jpg)), and an image of a Libyan diplomatic passport from Libya Observer ([https://libyaobserver.ly/news/bashar-al-assads-cousin-granted-libyan-diplomatic-passport](https://libyaobserver.ly/news/bashar-al-assads-cousin-granted-libyan-diplomatic-passport), ![image 8301](media/2025-08-30_08-29-1756542562-675304.jpg)).
