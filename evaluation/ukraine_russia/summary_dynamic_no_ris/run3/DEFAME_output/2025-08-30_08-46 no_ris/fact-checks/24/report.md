### Evidence from `web_search`
Warren Buffett is donating $6 billion to five charities, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, as reported by People.com ([https://people.com/warren-buffett-is-donating-6-billion-dollars-to-five-charities-11763166](https://people.com/warren-buffett-is-donating-6-billion-dollars-to-five-charities-11763166)). CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/with-6-billion-donation-buffett-has-now-given-away-over-60-billion.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/with-6-billion-donation-buffett-has-now-given-away-over-60-billion.html)) reports that Buffett has donated approximately $60 billion to charities over the past two decades.

The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-donation-charity-gates-foundation-e0d89b0cb2ce6cf8d41547b080d062e6](https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-donation-charity-gates-foundation-e0d89b0cb2ce6cf8d41547b080d062e6)) also reports on the $6 billion donation and that the total given to these foundations since 2006 is roughly $60 billion. None of the sources mention donations to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has been actively involved in providing aid to Ukraine. His foundation has provided $800 million in aid and is on track to donate $1 billion this year, with $520 million already given in humanitarian aid as of February 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that Warren Buffett himself has donated more than $500 million to Ukraine.

The search results also show that Warren Buffett has made significant donations to various charities, but none of these sources mention any donations to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Warren Buffett has personally donated over $500 million to Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has donated to Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Warren Buffett has personally donated more than $500 million to Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has been actively involved in providing aid to Ukraine, there is no evidence to suggest that Warren Buffett himself has donated more than $500 million to Ukraine. Sources like [Alliance magazine](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/), and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine) detail Howard Buffett's donations, but not Warren Buffett's.
