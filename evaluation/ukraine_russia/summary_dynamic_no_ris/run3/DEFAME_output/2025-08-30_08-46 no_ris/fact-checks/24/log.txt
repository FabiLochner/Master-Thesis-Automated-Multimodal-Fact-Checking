The claim 'Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has been actively involved in providing aid to Ukraine, there is no evidence to suggest that Warren Buffett himself has donated more than $500 million to Ukraine. Sources like [Alliance magazine](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/), and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine) detail Howard Buffett's donations, but not Warren Buffett's.

So, the overall veracity is: false
