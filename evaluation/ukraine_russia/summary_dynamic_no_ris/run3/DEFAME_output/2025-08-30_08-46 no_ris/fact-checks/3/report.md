## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of The Economist cover featuring Trump and Putin with the word "APOCALYPSE" (![image 2](media/3.jpg)) is a fake. According to [Ukrinform.net](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html), the cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of genuine Economist issues. The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, features a globe being struck by a golf club (![image 1576](media/2025-08-07_18-51-1754592678-969305.jpg), ![image 1577](media/2025-08-07_18-51-1754592679-963678.jpg)).

[PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b) states that the cover is altered, and the original cover from March 16, 2024, did not include the image of Trump and Putin. [AAP FactCheck](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/) also confirms the image is a fake, pointing out spelling mistakes and errors in the cover lines (![image 1580](media/2025-08-07_18-51-1754592718-848212.jpg), ![image 1581](media/2025-08-07_18-52-1754592726-018223.jpg)). The fake cover has been linked to pro-Kremlin sources.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a fake cover of The Economist. Several sources, including Ukrinform.net ([https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html)), PesaCheck ([https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b)), and AAP FactCheck ([https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/)), confirm that the image is altered and not a genuine cover. The actual covers from the relevant dates do not feature Trump and Putin.


## Final Judgement
The image of The Economist cover featuring Trump and Putin is a fake. Multiple sources confirm that the image is altered and not a genuine cover. The actual covers from the relevant dates do not feature Trump and Putin.
