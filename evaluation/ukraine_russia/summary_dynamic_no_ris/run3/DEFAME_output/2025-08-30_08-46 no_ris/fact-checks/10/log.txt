Useful result: From [Source](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv-hospitals-photos/): 
Content: The Kyiv Independent published an article on July 8, 2024, about the Russian missile attack on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv, including several images of the damaged hospital and the aftermath of the attack. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>. The article does not contain the image in the claim.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image shows photoshopped toys is unverified. While multiple sources confirm the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, resulting in casualties and damage ([Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine), [UN](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15761.doc.htm), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_July_2024_Russian_strikes_on_Ukraine)), no evidence supports or refutes the image's authenticity. Searches for the specific image did not yield any matching results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
