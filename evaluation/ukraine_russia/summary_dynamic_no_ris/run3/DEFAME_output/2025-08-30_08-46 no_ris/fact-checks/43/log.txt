Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine): 
Content: The search result from Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides a fact sheet on US assistance to Ukraine. <image:8705> The fact sheet refutes the claim that US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption, stating that US oversight is extensive and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability are extensive and growing. The fact sheet also states that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States. The fact sheet also argues that Ukraine is not a "forever war" for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war and that sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness. The fact sheet also states that the United States has not given Ukraine a blank check.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973): 
Content: The BBC reports that Ukraine's security service has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m. <image:8707>, <image:8708>.

The officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided. The article was published on January 28, 2024, and written by George Wright, BBC News.
