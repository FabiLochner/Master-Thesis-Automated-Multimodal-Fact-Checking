### Evidence from `web_search`
According to CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/russia-belgorod-state-of-emergency-b7fb57c21a43f0f06bf79a4477eb62e9](https://apnews.com/article/russia-belgorod-state-of-emergency-b7fb57c21a43f0f06bf79a4477eb62e9)), Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukrainian forces had taken control of Sudzha, a town in Russia's Kursk region, in August 2024.

Polskie Radio ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/9766/artykul/3496996,ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-sudzha-zelensky-denies-encirclement-in-kursk-region](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/9766/artykul/3496996,ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-sudzha-zelensky-denies-encirclement-in-kursk-region)) reports that Ukrainian forces withdrew from certain areas in the Kursk region, and Zelensky denied encirclement, speaking at a press conference in Kyiv on March 12, 2025. ![image 7](media/9.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces, according to Zelensky, took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024 ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl)). The evidence also indicates that Ukrainian forces later withdrew from some areas in the Kursk region ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/9766/artykul/3496996,ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-sudzha-zelensky-denies-encirclement-in-kursk-region](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/9766/artykul/3496996,ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-sudzha-zelensky-denies-encirclement-in-kursk-region)).

The evidence does not explicitly state that the image shows Zelensky arriving in Sudzha in August 2024 or meeting with representatives there. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.
