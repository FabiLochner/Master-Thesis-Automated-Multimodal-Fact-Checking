Content: MSNBC's "Morning Joe" reports that Ben Stiller debunked claims that his trip to Ukraine was funded by USAID. <image:1>. The report states that Elon Musk amplified the false claim on social media. The report was published in February.

The claim '<image:17> This image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, for which Stiller received $4 million from USAID.' is false.
Justification: The image accurately depicts Ben Stiller meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in June 2022, as reported by multiple news outlets like [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989). However, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for the trip is false, as Stiller denied these claims and stated he self-funded the humanitarian visit, as reported by [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb).
