### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a large-scale corruption scheme in the defense sector involving inflated prices for military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent. <image:k> Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, highlighting the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) reports on US aid to Ukraine, which totaled $134 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy's "Ukraine Support Tracker" ([https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/)) quantifies aid pledged to Ukraine, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025.

The provided sources also list military aid packages from various countries, including the United States, Germany, France, and the UK, which include artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, and drones ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)). None of the sources mention Ukraine selling armaments. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While there is evidence of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, there is no mention of Ukraine selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The provided sources detail the amount of aid provided by the US and other countries, as well as the types of military equipment provided, but do not mention any arms sales by Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The search results reveal instances of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices for military equipment and kickbacks. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The provided sources detail the aid provided by the US and other countries, but do not mention any arms sales by Ukraine.
