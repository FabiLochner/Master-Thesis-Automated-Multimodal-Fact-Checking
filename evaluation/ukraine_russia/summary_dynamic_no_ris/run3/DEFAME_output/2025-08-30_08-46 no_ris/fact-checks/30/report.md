Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mentioning a timeline of the war, including events up to December 2024, and a section on January 2025 - May 2025. It also mentions that in December 2024, Donald Trump began a push for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the Russo-Ukrainian War ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War)) states that the conflict began in late February 2014 and is ongoing, including the Russian annexation of Crimea and the ongoing Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>, <image:l>, <image:m>, <image:n>. A BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o)) discusses the ongoing war, mentioning that no peace deal has been reached despite efforts by US President Donald Trump. The article includes maps showing changes in Russian military control in Ukraine from February 2022 to August 2025. ![image 5000](media/2025-08-29_07-11-1756451515-748344.jpg), ![image 5002](media/2025-08-29_07-11-1756451516-148510.jpg), ![image 5008](media/2025-08-29_07-11-1756451519-202482.jpg), ![image 4997](media/2025-08-29_07-11-1756451515-131491.jpg).

Newsweek reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he sees the war ending in 2025 ([https://www.newsweek.com/zelensky-sees-timeline-end-ukraine-war-2046992](https://www.newsweek.com/zelensky-sees-timeline-end-ukraine-war-2046992)). ![image 5011](media/2025-08-29_07-12-1756451525-653072.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that no peace deal was reached between Ukraine and Russia in early 2025. While there were peace talks and negotiations, including efforts by Donald Trump, the war was ongoing as of August 2025. The BBC article explicitly states that no peace deal had been reached.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that while peace negotiations were underway, no peace deal was reached between Ukraine and Russia in early 2025. The BBC article confirms the war was ongoing in August 2025.

`false`
