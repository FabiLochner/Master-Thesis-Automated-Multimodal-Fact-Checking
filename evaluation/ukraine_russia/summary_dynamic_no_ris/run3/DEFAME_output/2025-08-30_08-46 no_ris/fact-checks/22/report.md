```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the Kursk campaign, which took place in Kursk Oblast, Russia, from August 6, 2024, to March 2025, involving incursions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The campaign's details, including the date, location, and results, are provided, along with the belligerents, commanders, and leaders involved. The involvement of North Korea and the reactions of the United States, Germany, and NATO are also mentioned. The search result from Wikipedia does not include the image ![image 12](media/22.jpg).

An article from The Guardian, published on August 8, 2024, discusses Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region of Russia, mentioning the Ukrainian forces' advance and that there have been no confirmed reports of chemical weapons use in the Kursk offensive. The article includes an image ![image 8534](media/2025-08-30_08-55-1756544108-484766.jpg).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The search results from The Guardian, published on August 8, 2024, mention the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region but state that there were no confirmed reports of chemical weapons use. The geolocation of the image suggests several possible locations, including Russia and Ukraine.

The claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The Guardian article contradicts the claim by stating that there were no confirmed reports of chemical weapons use.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the exact location of the image and confirmation of the type of attack.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide information about the Kursk offensive, including the date and location, but do not confirm the use of chemical weapons. The geolocation of the image suggests several possible locations, including Russia and Ukraine. The evidence does not support the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the search results confirm the Kursk offensive occurred in August 2024, there are no confirmed reports of chemical weapons use, as stated in a relevant article from The Guardian. The geolocation of the image does not provide conclusive evidence to support the claim.
