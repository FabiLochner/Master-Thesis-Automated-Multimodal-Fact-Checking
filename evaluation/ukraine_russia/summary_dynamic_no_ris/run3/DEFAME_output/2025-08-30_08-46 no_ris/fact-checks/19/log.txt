Useful result: From [Source](https://www.firstonline.info/en/lucraina-ruba-la-scena-al-g20-via-libera-di-biden-alle-bombe-a-lungo-raggio-in-territorio-russo/): 
Content: The article from firstonline.info discusses the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro. It mentions that Giorgia Meloni had a bilateral meeting with Lula and that Italian companies intend to invest 40 billion euros in Brazil.

The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The evidence confirms that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. However, the search results do not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Instead, she urged Putin to end the war, as reported by [eurointegration.com.ua](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/23/7174141/) and [pravda.com.ua](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/23/7430027/).
