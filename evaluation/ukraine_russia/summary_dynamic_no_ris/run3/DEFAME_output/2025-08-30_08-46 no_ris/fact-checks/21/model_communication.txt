Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:439>

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

! Zelensky also expressed his hope that Mexico, under Sheinbaum’s leadership, would clearly distance itself from Russia.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. He expressed disappointment over Mexico's inclusion of Russian military personnel in its Independence Day parade and called for recognition of Ukraine’s struggle for independence. "Our Constitution is very clear, noble, and pacifist," she said.

Throughout his tenure, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) maintained a balanced stance on the Ukraine conflict, condemning Russia’s invasion while criticising the US for sending arms to Ukraine. Mexico has also refused to impose sanctions on Russia and declined to send military aid to Ukraine, despite requests from Ukrainian officials.

Nevertheless, it has played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Kyiv after taking office on 1 October, Fuser News reports.

Sheinbaum [stated](https://fusernews.com/nuestra-responsabilidad-es-aqui-sheinbaum-rechaza-invitacion-a-ucrania/)
 her intention to maintain a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, continuing the approach of her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine and adheres to a policy of neutrality regarding the war. Ukraine and the EU have pressured Mexico over its approach to Russia, especially after inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin to the upcoming presidential inauguration despite his ICC arrest warrant.

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico has [called](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/08/08/ukraine-calls-on-mexico-to-arrest-putin-during-mexican-presidents-inauguration/?swcfpc=1)
 on local authorities to detain Putin if he visits, as Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. On 8 August, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said that the European Union had also urged Mexico to arrest Putin if he arrives in the country.

Mexico has rejected a request from Ukraine to arrest the Russian President if he attends the inauguration of Mexico’s next president on 1 October.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of abducting and forcibly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Since then, the Russian leader has avoided traveling to countries that have signed the Rome Statute due to the threat of arrest.

She added that Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with all countries except Ecuador, where an embassy attack in April was deemed a “violation of sovereignty.”

In August, Russian media reported that Mexico had invited Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration on October 1, 2024.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico has urged Mexican authorities to arrest Putin if he visits, citing his war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court, which Mexico recognizes.

López Obrador had previously rejected Ukraine’s request to arrest Putin.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [pointed that out last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-president-tells-trump-tariffs-will-worsen-inflation-kill-jobs-2024-11-26/)
 in response to Trump’s claim that he’ll address this country’s fentanyl problem by putting a tariff on Mexican imports. 4, 2024, 6:06 PM EST

By [Julio Ricardo Varela](https://www.msnbc.com/author/julio-ricardo-varela-ncpn297186)
, MSNBC Columnist

Much of President-elect Donald Trump’s rise to power can be linked to [his blaming Mexico for America’s problems](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-tariffs-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-rcna181923)
. We do not consume synthetic drugs,” Sheinbaum said. When he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015, he claimed [Mexico was mostly “sending” criminals](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-6-most-provocative-parts-donald-trumps-2016-announcement-msna619371)
, including drug dealers and rapists, to the U.S., and [he promised to build a wall](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-immigration-mass-deportation-rcna179782)
 to keep migrants out. Now, his threat to [impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-threats-day-one-trade-tariffs-matter-rcna181793)
 is based in part on the idea that Mexico is the cause of the United States’ fentanyl addiction and to blame for a migrant crisis.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless. It riles up the nativism in his MAGA followers and gives them the scapegoat they crave.

But that ignores that the United States is the world’s most lucrative illegal drug market, [estimated at $150 billion yearly](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/08/20.html)
 for the most common drugs, along with an [increasing use of fentanyl](https://time.com/6977717/fentanyl-pills-seized-study/)
. “Unfortunately, what we do have is the people who are being killed by the crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”

Drugs aren’t the only thing that U.S. Mexico also has enforced new visa requirements for those from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and increased expulsions.”

That all happened under then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his successor, Sheinbaum, [told Trump last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-mexico-president-sheinbaum-immigration-rcna182119)
 “that caravans weren’t arriving at the northern border because they are being served in Mexico.” In other words, Mexico continues to be the United States’ real southern border wall. This, despite Sheinbaum’s claim that “Mexico’s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.” That might sound noble, but Mexico has benefited from being a complicit immigration enforcement partner with the U.S. That type of attitude led [to successes in decreasing drug fatalities](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-overdose-opioid-epidemic-rcna182059)
 during the Biden administration."

Content: "‘war on drugs’ as poison to Mexico.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum made this statement — “Start with your own country” — during her regular morning press conference Feb. In the cities of the United States, who sells the drugs that have wreaked such tragedy?”

President Sheinbaum knows what she is talking about, especially if one considers who the big winner is in the drug business. The secrets of drug trafficking, from Colombia to Chicago” — states that there are some 20 million drug users in the United States, of which some 6 million are addicts; however, it is dangerous to talk about the subject, so it is avoided, leading to total ignorance and confusion and the easy construction of stereotypes aimed at blaming the scourge exclusively on the producing countries.

Fernández Menéndez and Ronquillo explain that, after the shipments have crossed the border using all kinds of transport and also through tunnels along the entire border area, the drug trafficking networks begin to operate from 14 cities in the south in the states of New Mexico, Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida and Louisiana, where the drugs are smuggled. In the continuation of the controversy and in defense of Mexico’s best interests, three days later Sheinbaum reiterated that the United States must take responsibility for the serious problem of drug trafficking and drug consumption in its country.

The Mexican president explained that drug trafficking arises from the demand for drugs; as long as there is consumption, there will be supply. In this area, she insisted that the United States must also take charge of controlling its own generators of violence and domestic production of psychotropic substances and must make an effort to monitor and intervene in its illegal internal market.

It must also be said Claudia Sheinbaum showed her indomitable will and patriotic feeling in the conversation she had with the U.S. 7, Sheinbaum reported that she told Trump that it was crucial in the fight against drug trafficking that weapons from the U.S. But today, there are several countries and governments that support and defend the dignity and honor of their peoples.

Claudia Sheinbaum, just like the priests Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, just like Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas, is giving continuity to policies to recover decorum and consciousness of Mexican sovereignty initiated in this century by Andrés Manuel López Obrador. government’s use of the “war on drugs” as a pretext for intervention and exposes inconsistencies in Washington’s propaganda. The Mexican president then said: “They have a lot to do in the United States,” and asked, “How does fentanyl or any other drug get there? Already at the end of the 20th century, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated the profit produced by international drug trafficking at close to $500 billion, more than half of which circulated through the U.S."

United States President Donald Trump thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drugs campaign, on which he pledged to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

[Speaking at a Saudi Arabia-backed investment conference in Miami](https://x.com/jenarovillamil/status/1892377901682589986?s=46)
, Trump said he had spoken to Sheinbaum about drugs and she told him that Mexico is not a “consumer nation.”

> [#ULTIMAHORA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ULTIMAHORA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> . — his “sweeping freeze on foreign aid has temporarily stopped U.S.-funded anti-narcotics programs in Mexico that for years have been working to curb the flow of the synthetic opioid into the United States,” [Reuters said in an exclusive report last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-stops-anti-fentanyl-work-mexico-2025-02-13/)
.

**‘Fentanyl kills’: Mexico’s anti-drug campaign**
-------------------------------------------------

In early January, [Sheinbaum officially presented a 300-million-peso (US $14.8 million) “national” and “permanent” anti-drugs campaign](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-presenta-campana-preventiva-nacional-y-permanente-alejate-de-las-drogas-el-fentanilo-te-mata)
 under the name “Aléjate de las drogas. (CBP Troy Miller/X)

The government of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador [also ran an anti-drugs campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/fruitless-anti-drug-abuse-campaign/)
, and in early 2023 then deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell was [announced as Mexico’s new addiction prevention “czar.”](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lopez-gatell-addiction-czar/)

The current and former anti-drugs campaigns have [faced criticism for a range of reasons](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
, including because of the focus on fentanyl, which — as Sheinbaum has pointed out — is not widely used in Mexico, and because they have allegedly aroused interest in the synthetic opioid among users of other drugs.

“The main drug problem in Mexico is the use of methamphetamines,” [the news website Expansión reported earlier this month](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
.

Health Minister David Kershenobich said last month that was “probably” the case, although he said that fentanyl “is the most significant” drug used in Mexico “in the sense of mortality and the harm it causes.”

Have something to say? President Donald Trump, who said Sheinbaum inspired his new anti-drug campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump-696x464.jpg "sheinbaum-trump")](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump.jpg)

Despite her status as 'the world's leading Trump whisperer,' President Sheinbaum and U.S. We have great family values,'” Trump said.

He noted that Sheinbaum — who he referred to as a “very wonderful woman” — also told him that Mexico spends a lot of money on anti-drug advertising.

“And I said ‘unbelievable.’ That was such a great conversation because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — \[we’re going to say\] that they chew up your brain, they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. … We’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you,” he said.

Trump didn’t say exactly when he spoke to Sheinbaum about Mexico’s anti-drug advertising campaign.

Sheinbaum [said on social media in late November](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-responds-trump-claim-stop-migration-close-border/)
 that she had spoken to Trump about “the campaign we’re carrying out in the country to prevent the use of fentanyl.”

The U.S. Stay away from drugs, choose to be happy,” [says one video advertisement](https://x.com/SSalud_mx/status/1890611998871704013/video/1)
.

On the day the “Stay away from drugs campaign” was officially launched, [Sheinbaum asserted that the use of fentanyl “is not really a problem” in Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-fentanyl/)
.

While [fentanyl is used in Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fentanyl-use-spreads-deeper-into-mexico-worrying-authorities-2024-02-20/)
 and there have been deaths linked to the powerful synthetic opioid here, “there is not a crisis like there is in the United States,” she said.

“… We don’t want \[the overdose crisis\] to reach our country, and that’s why we’re starting this campaign against fentanyl,” Sheinbaum said.

One of the most notable statements Nate Vance made was calling his cousin and Trump "_Vladimir Putin's useful idiots._" In an interview with _Le Figaro_, he argued that by halting or reducing support for Ukraine, his cousin and Trump were effectively doing Putin's bidding under the false hope of appeasing the Russian leader. ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-newsweek.com_17-0)

Content: "And speaking of which, why is Elon Musk in the Oval Office wearing a baseball hat and a T-shirt all the time?"

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)

 to Kyiv.

[Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has eschewed suits for military-style dress in what he says is solidarity with soldiers.

"Everyone knows that's why he does that and it's kind of a symbolic thing," Nate Vance said."

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

On February 24, the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a press conference underscoring his belief that his country would emerge victorious.

But an edited excerpt of Zelenskyy’s comments has widely circulated online, with commentators claiming that the Ukrainian president expects American citizens will be sent to fight in the war.

In the viral 19-second video clip, Zelenskyy can be heard saying the following through simultaneous interpretation:

No, Zelenskyy Did Not Say American Sons and Daughters Will Have to Die in Ukraine

#### Monica Crowley

Host of the Monica Crowley Podcast and a former U.S. assistant secretary of the treasury, [retweeted](https://twitter.com/monicacrowley/status/1630727982196183040?s=46&t=MkWuMjIrkku9SokUO8Tqvg)
 the clip with the following commentary:

_“Zelensky now directly threatening us and claiming American sons and daughters will have to fight and die for Ukraine. support for Ukraine, including a decision to send it 31 M1 Abrams battle tanks, is intended to help Ukraine “defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity,” and “is not an offensive threat to Russia.”

This isn't the first time manipulated video has been disseminated to show Zelenskyy in an unfavorable light or undermine Ukraine's war effort.

In November, 2022, [Polygraph.info reported](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-misleading-video-falsely-portrays-zelenskyy-as-threatening-war-he-said-just-the-opposite-/6820594.html)
 how comments by Zelenskyy, in which he stressed his desire to end the war and bring peace to his country, were selectively edited to falsely portray the Ukrainian leader as threatening war.

The claim that Zelenskyy said the United States would have to send its citizens to “fight and die in Ukraine” is false.

The edited clip removes the context from Zelenskyy’s statement, which concerned a hypothetical situation in which Ukraine loses the war and Russia moves against members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a 30-member military alliance of which the U.S. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP) <image:8505>

19-second video of Zelensky goes viral. See what was edited out

03:03

Washington CNN  — 

A viral video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky takes his remarks out of context to wrongly make it sound like he demanded that Americans send their sons and daughters to fight in the war in Ukraine.

The out-of-context 19-second video has been viewed millions of times on Twitter. Mike Lee of Utah shared former Trump administration official William Wolfe’s tweet of the video in which Wolfe claimed that Zelensky wants “dead Americans on Ukrainian soil.” Lee himself [added](https://twitter.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1630787239427883008?s=20)
 in a tweet on Tuesday night: “Zelensky has no right to presume that our sons and daughters will fight his war. If it happens so that Ukraine, due to various opinions and weakening – depleting – of assistance, loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO member states, and then the US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. It features a clip of Zelensky speaking at a news conference last week as an interpreter translates his words into English as follows: “The US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. But it’s just inaccurate to depict Zelensky’s “have to send their sons and daughters” remark as a demand that Americans take part in combat on Ukrainian soil.

Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment, and Crowley could not be immediately reached for comment. Rather, he predicted that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient assistance, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization_ [_member countries_](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/nato_countries.htm)
 _in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will have to send troops to defend. Ukraine is not a NATO member._

Lee deleted his tweet after CNN informed his office on Wednesday about how the video was taken out of context.

Zelensky made the comments at a news conference on the anniversary of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) describes a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) also reported on the abrupt end to the White House visit between Zelenskyy and Trump on the same day <image:517>.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) published an article detailing a heated meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The article mentions a disagreement over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) published an article detailing a heated meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, at the White House <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The article mentions a disagreement over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The VOA article clarifies that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023. The People article ([https://people.com/politics/ukraines-president-zelenskyy-wants-his-children-to-know-about-the-invasion/](https://people.com/politics/ukraines-president-zelenskyy-wants-his-children-to-know-about-the-invasion/)) does not mention any statements about the U.S. sending their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

The CNN article explains that Zelenskyy predicted that if Ukraine loses the war, the U.S. would have to send troops to defend NATO member countries in the Baltics.


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him. Fact-check articles from reputable sources like Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) debunked similar claims, clarifying that the statement was either taken out of context or misattributed.

Therefore, the claim is false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial search revealed a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February 2025, but did not confirm the specific quote. Subsequent searches found fact-checks from reputable sources like Voice of America and CNN, which debunked similar claims, confirming that Zelenskyy did not make the statement.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources. `false`

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)
, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

### Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers. 

"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., [said in a statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/28/leader-jeffries-statement-on-white-house-meeting-with-president-zelensky/)

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

====================================================================================

A host of European leaders will accompany Zelenskyy to Washington.

By[David Brennan](https://abcnews.go.com/author/david_brennan)

August 18, 2025, 6:49 AM

LONDON -- President Donald Trump on Sunday teased what he said would be a "big day" as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a host of European leaders prepared for a White House meeting that Trump said can end Russia's invasion of Ukraine "almost immediately."

Monday's Washington, D.C., summit follows Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. <image:8536>

President Donald Trump welcomes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. The president also repeated that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO, though White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and Zelenskyy have hinted at alternative security guarantees involving the U.S.

"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight," Trump wrote on social media on Sunday.

The president has previously incorrectly framed Ukraine as the initiator of the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. 28, 2025.

Ben Curtis/AP

"NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE," Trump added. ET and hold a multilateral meeting with them at 3 p.m.

Vice President JD Vance will also attend the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, a source familiar with the plans confirmed to ABC News. Vance was part of the dramatic Oval Office meeting in February during which the vice president publicly berated Zelenskyy over his alleged ingratitude for U.S. wartime support.

Zelenskyy said in a post to social media that he had arrived in Washington on Sunday night, expressing his gratitude to Trump for hosting the planned meeting. Since that meeting, Trump appears to have dropped his demand for Russia to agree to an immediate ceasefire and is now pressuring Kyiv to accept territorial concessions to secure a peace deal.

On Sunday, Trump explicitly said Ukraine will not regain Crimea -- occupied by Russia in 2014. "Some things never change!!!"

Trump is expected to greet Zelenskyy outside the West Wing at 1 p.m. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace."

Friday's summit in Alaska ended with Russia demanding that Ukraine cede the entirety of its contested and fortified eastern Donetsk region in exchange for an end to the fighting, two sources told ABC News.

Trump then challenged Kyiv to "make the deal" and lavished praise on Putin."

But senators on both sides of the aisle tried to provide Zelenskyy with "friendly coaching," according to two people who were in the room during the bipartisan meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

‘Dummies for Putin’: Democrats defend Zelenskyy after ‘shameful’ Trump meeting
==============================================================================

Ukrainian leader abruptly left White House after being publicly berated by US president in Russia ceasefire talks

[Democratic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats)
 lawmakers rushed to defend [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 after the Ukrainian leader was publicly berated by [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 in a disastrous Oval Office meeting.

The US president accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war three” while his vice-president, [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
, called the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful”, before cutting short talks aimed at kicking off the process of ending Kyiv’s three-year war with Russia.

Zelenskyy abruptly left the White House soon after without signing a rare critical minerals deal with the US that Trump has said is the first step toward a ceasefire agreement that he is seeking to broker between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

Democratic senators came to Zelenskyy’s defense in statements condemning Trump and Vance’s “shameful” and “disgraceful” treatment of the Ukrainian leader.

In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video

“Every time I’ve met with President Zelenskyy, he’s thanked the American people for our strong support,” Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, [wrote on X](https://x.com/ChrisCoons/status/1895546804739186739)
. “They’re popping champagne in the Kremlin.”

Trump and Vance “are doing Putin’s dirty work”, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, [said](https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1895538251601232175)
 after the calamitous meeting, adding that his party will “never stop fighting for freedom and democracy”.

Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island, also [accused](https://x.com/SenWhitehouse/status/1895538812417425623)
 Trump and Vance of “acting like ventriloquist dummies for Putin”.

Whitehouse was part of a bipartisan group of senators who met with Zelenskyy earlier in the morning before his meeting with the president. The Illinois senator Dick Durbin [added](https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1895528692404900022)
: “The people of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy deserve an apology.”

“Trump and Vance berating Zelenskyy – putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush – is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies,” Durbin said. “We owe him our thanks for leading a nation fighting on the front lines of democracy – not the public berating he received at the White House.”

Adam Schiff, the California senator, [said](https://x.com/SenAdamSchiff/status/1895534637017137234)
: ““A hero and a coward are meeting in the Oval Office today. And when the meeting is over, the hero will return home to Ukraine.”

Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, [said](https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1895535422450909393)
: “What an utter embarrassment for America. The Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said the hour-long discussion showed “strong bipartisan support in the Senate for Ukraine’s freedom and democracy”.

Klobuchar later addressed Vance directly in a social media [post](https://x.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/1895541340265726410)

“Our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news)
,” she wrote. Today Trump and Vance are bending America’s knee,” she said.

But Republican senators rushed to defend Trump, describing the president’s exchange with Zelenskyy as evidence that he was “putting America first”.

Mike Lee, a Utah Republican senator, [thanked](https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1895536905103749249)
 Trump and Vance “for standing up to our country and putting America first”. The Indiana Republican senator Jim Banks also thanked Trump for “standing up for America”.

“\[Zelenskyy\] ungratefully expects us to bankroll and escalate another forever war–all while disrespecting the President,” Banks [wrote](https://x.com/SenatorBanks/status/1895543609900089391)

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. You should be thanking the president.

**Zelenskyy**: Have you ever been to [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 to see the problems we have?

**Vance**: I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President.

Do you disagree that you’ve had problems with bringing people in your military, and do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

**Zelenskyy**: First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you."

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)

 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)

, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that according to a British Army official, with the current way of fighting, it would take Russia five years to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. The article also mentions that as of 29 July 2025, 5,432 Russian officers had been killed.

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. In our next analysis, we will also be able to investigate the mortality peak of late 2024 in greater depth.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

The map below shows the distribution of casualties across Russia’s regions. This shift reflects a cumulative effect: prison recruitment had significantly waned, no new mobilisation had been announced, yet the stream of volunteers continued unabated.

By August 29, the death of **over** **5,500** **officers** of the Russian army and other security agencies had been confirmed.

The proportion of officer deaths among overall casualties has steadily declined since the conflict began. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior officer in the General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/04/25/balashikha)
 by a car bomb in a Moscow suburb in April 2025.

Two deputy army commanders, Major General [Andrei Sukhovetsky](https://admnvrsk.ru/o-gorode/novosti/glavnye-novosti/news-03032022200708-105771/)
 (41st Army) and Major General [Vladimir Frolov](https://www.fontanka.ru/2022/04/16/71262053/)
 (8th Army), were killed in the first weeks of the war. In November 2023, Major General Vladimir Zavadsky, deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2023/12/04/zavadsky)
 near the village of Krynky.

In November 2024, Major General Pavel Klimenko, commander of the 5th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade (formerly the “Oplot” Brigade of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic), [was fatally wounded](https://zona.media/news/2024/11/07/klimenko)
 by an FPV drone.

In July 2025, a strike on the headquarters of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade [killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/07/11/155)
 at least six officers, including the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, Mikhail Gudkov.

The two retired generals on the list are Kanamat Botashev, a pilot who had been dismissed for crashing a fighter jet and was fighting for _Wagner_ _PMC_ when his Su-25 [was shot down](https://zona.media/news/2022/05/31/su27)
 in May 2022, and Andrei Golovatsky, a former Interior Ministry general [serving](https://zona.media/news/2019/02/22/army)
 an 8.5-year prison sentence who was killed in June 2024.

The date of death is known in **98,340** cases. Of course, this list is not exhaustive, as not every death is publicly reported.

To build a more complete picture of the war’s true toll, we have developed an estimate based on excess male mortality, using data from the national Probate Registry."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. A Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. However, Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. Another Mediazona article, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed by August 2025.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses aligns with the higher end of the casualty estimates provided by the British Army official. However, the evidence also presents lower figures, such as the Mediazona estimates.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as the evidence provides a range of estimates, and the exact number of losses is not definitively confirmed.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. The article includes a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: Mediazona, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. The article mentions that in November 2024, male mortality reached a peak of approximately 3,000 deaths per week. The article also states that the date of death is known in 98,340 cases. The last update to the Probate Registry estimate was August 29, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. A Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. However, Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. Another Mediazona article, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed by August 2025.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses aligns with the higher end of the casualty estimates provided by the British Army official. However, the evidence also presents lower figures, such as the Mediazona estimates.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as the evidence provides a range of estimates, and the exact number of losses is not definitively confirmed.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the exact number of Russian troop losses. While some sources mention estimates that align with the claim, others provide significantly lower figures. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim's accuracy. `not enough information`

According to a Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, more than 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" mentions that a British Army official estimated that it would take Russia five years to control four regions, costing Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. The article also states that as of July 29, 2025, 5,432 Russian officers had been killed.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. The article includes a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: Mediazona, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. The article mentions that in November 2024, male mortality reached a peak of approximately 3,000 deaths per week. The article also states that the date of death is known in 98,340 cases. The last update to the Probate Registry estimate was August 29, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. A Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. However, Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. Another Mediazona article, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed by August 2025.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses aligns with the higher end of the casualty estimates provided by the British Army official. However, the evidence also presents lower figures, such as the Mediazona estimates.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as the evidence provides a range of estimates, and the exact number of losses is not definitively confirmed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the claim is not entirely accurate. While some sources suggest casualty figures that could approach the 1.5 million mark, the most recent official estimate from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as of August 30, 2025, puts the number of military personnel losses at approximately 1,081,330. This suggests that the claim overestimates the losses.

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

 ![Image:](//static.prsa.pl/images/0cef8818-5db9-4622-ab61-65537c098870.jpg)Image: Polish Ministry of Defence/gov.pl

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.
