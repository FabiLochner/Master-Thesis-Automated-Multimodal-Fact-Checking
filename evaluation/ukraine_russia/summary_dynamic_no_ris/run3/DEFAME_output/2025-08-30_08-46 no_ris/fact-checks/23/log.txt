Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crew8y7pwd5o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on November 15, 2024, discussing the amount of military aid the US has given to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute, the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. <image:3178>, <image:3180>. The article also mentions that Donald Trump claimed the US had spent over $300 billion, which the BBC Verify concluded was not accurate.

Useful result: From [Source](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-money-has-the-us-given-ukraine-since-russias-invasion/): 
Content: The United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025, by the USAfacts team.

The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/67411857), indicate that the total amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine by February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The BBC article states that the US had spent $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
