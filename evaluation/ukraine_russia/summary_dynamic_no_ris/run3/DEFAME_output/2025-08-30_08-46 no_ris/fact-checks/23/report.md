## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan provided in late 2024 and that President Trump froze military aid in early March 2025, lifting the freeze shortly after. The Center for Strategic and International Studies ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine, including $652 million in weapons sales and the continuation of around $30 billion in aid over three-and-a-half years. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)

An NPR article from August 5, 2025 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) mentions that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. ![image 494](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502171-020535.jpg), ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a BBC article published on November 15, 2024, the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, according to the Kiel Institute. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The article also mentions that Donald Trump claimed the US had spent over $300 billion, which the BBC Verify concluded was not accurate. ![image 3178](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853512-728986.jpg), ![image 3180](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853514-364342.jpg)

USAFacts reported that the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine by February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. The BBC article from November 15, 2024, states that the US had spent $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense reported $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025. Furthermore, an NPR article from August 5, 2025, mentions that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim of $350 billion in military aid by February 2025 is inaccurate. Multiple sources provide figures significantly lower than the claimed amount. The BBC article from November 2024 states that the US had spent $130.6 billion by June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense reported $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/67411857), indicate that the total amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine by February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The BBC article states that the US had spent $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025.
