Useful result: From [Source](https://en.isna.ir/news/1403060502566/F-16s-may-have-been-hit-in-Russian-strike-on-hangar-in-Ivano-Frankovsk): 
Content: The search result from ISNA contains an image of a destroyed aircraft inside a hangar. The article suggests that F-16s may have been hit in a Russian strike on a hangar in Ivano-Frankovsk. <image:8765>

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While evidence confirms that Ukraine has F-16 fighter jets and has lost some during the conflict with Russia, the image in the claim does not match any of the images found in the search results. Specifically, CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-loses-16-fighter-amid-massed-russian-drone/story?id=123315001](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-loses-16-fighter-amid-massed-russian-drone/story?id=123315001)) report on the loss of a Ukrainian F-16, but the provided evidence does not contain the image from the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
