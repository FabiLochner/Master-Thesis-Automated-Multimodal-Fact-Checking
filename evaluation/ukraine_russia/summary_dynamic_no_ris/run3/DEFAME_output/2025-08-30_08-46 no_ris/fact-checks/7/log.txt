Useful result: From [Source](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military): 
Content: Detector Media states that propagandists falsely claim BlackRock owns 47% of Ukraine's territory and asked not to bury soldiers on its land. The press service of the President of Ukraine reported a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyi and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in late 2022 to discuss recovery projects. Detector Media found the claim that BlackRock banned Ukraine from burying its military is wrong. In 2023, Ukraine signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund for the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military.

The claim 'BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim that BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on land it owns in Ukraine is false. Fact-checks by The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)) show the claim originates from Russian propaganda and satirical sources.
