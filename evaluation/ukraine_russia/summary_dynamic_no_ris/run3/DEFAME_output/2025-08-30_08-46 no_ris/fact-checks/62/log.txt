Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March%E2%80%93May_2025_United_States_attacks_in_Yemen): 
Content: The search result is from Wikipedia and discusses the Marchâ€“May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen. It mentions that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in March 2025. The article also mentions several US airstrikes in Yemen during April 2025. The article also mentions the Red Sea crisis and the Gaza war. <image:20>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Houthis did shoot down a US drone in March 2025, the image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in Israel, and there is no evidence to support that the image depicts a drone shot down by the Houthis. The web search results confirm the drone downing by the Houthis, as reported by sources like [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/) and [Military Times](https://www.militarytimes.com/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
