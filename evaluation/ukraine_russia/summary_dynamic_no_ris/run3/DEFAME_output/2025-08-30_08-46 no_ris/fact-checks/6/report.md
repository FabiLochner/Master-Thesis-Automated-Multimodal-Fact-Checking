## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that an F-16 jet crashed in August 2024 during a Russian attack, resulting in the pilot's death. There are also claims of Ukrainian F-16s shooting down Russian aircraft. However, the evidence does not support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders.

The image provided in the claim appears to depict a jet being hit, but the evidence does not confirm the type of aircraft or the circumstances of the event.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that while F-16s have been involved in incidents, including crashes and combat, there is no evidence to support the specific claim of a US F-16 being shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The image provided does not confirm the type of aircraft or the circumstances of the event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsubstantiated. While there are reports of F-16s being involved in incidents, including a crash in August 2024, and claims of Ukrainian F-16s shooting down Russian aircraft, there is no evidence to support the specific claim of a US F-16 being shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The image provided does not confirm the type of aircraft or the circumstances of the event.
