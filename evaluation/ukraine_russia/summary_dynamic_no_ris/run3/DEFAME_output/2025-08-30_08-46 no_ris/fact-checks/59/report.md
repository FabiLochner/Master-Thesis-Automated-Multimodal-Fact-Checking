### Evidence from `web_search`
The Euronews article from January 15, 2025, debunks a social media claim that lists US politicians who allegedly received bribes from Ukraine, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitt Romney. The article states that the image is false and lacks evidence, and that the claims have been debunked by other fact-checkers. The claims originate from at least 2023 and are part of a disinformation campaign. The BBC News article from July 21, 2023, discusses an FBI document detailing an allegation that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm, but there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. The Wikipedia article discusses the Bidenâ€“Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden improperly withheld a loan guarantee and took a bribe, but a joint investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. ![image 18](media/59.jpg) ![image 8767](media/2025-08-30_09-14-1756545249-786915.jpg) ![image 8769](media/2025-08-30_09-14-1756545250-942760.jpg) ![image 8771](media/2025-08-30_09-14-1756545252-124651.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image ![image 18](media/59.jpg)
 is part of a disinformation campaign. Fact-checkers have debunked the claim that the image shows authentic information about US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. There is no evidence to support the claim that Joe Biden received $92 million in bribes.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false, as multiple sources debunk the image and the claims made within it. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including Euronews, have debunked the image ![image 18](media/59.jpg)
