# Search Result
From [Source](https://city-countyobserver.com/a-tale-of-two-wealthy-senators/): 
Content: "Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer of New York are prominent examples, each reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars despite earning approximately $200,000 annually in their federal roles. This inheritance was a key factor in a significant jump in McConnell’s reported net worth.

In addition to his marriage, McConnell has been a savvy political operator. For instance, McConnell’s alignment with corporate interests has ensured steady campaign contributions, bolstering his influence and indirectly enhancing his financial security.

#### **Chuck Schumer: Real Estate Deals and Financial Savvy**

Senator Chuck Schumer, representing New York since 1998, has also achieved remarkable financial success, with recent estimates suggesting his net worth surpasses $60 million. **Spousal Wealth and Inheritance**: Marriages to affluent individuals or inheritances significantly boost the net worth of some politicians, as seen with McConnell.
3. Senegal (sneaky but legal) was intrigued and here is the result.

#### **Mitch McConnell: Wealth Through Marriage and Political Longevity**

Senator Mitch McConnell has long been a fixture in American politics, representing Kentucky since 1985 and serving as Senate Majority Leader for several years. His reported net worth exceeds $30 million, a figure that belies his relatively modest government salary. New York’s status as a financial hub has further enabled him to cultivate relationships with high-net-worth individuals and corporations. **Campaign Fundraising and Financial Management**: While campaign funds are strictly regulated, the infrastructure and networks built for fundraising often have ancillary financial benefits for politicians.

The wealth of Senators McConnell and Schumer illustrates how political careers, coupled with advantageous circumstances, can lead to substantial financial gains. Unlike McConnell, Schumer’s wealth stems less from family ties and more from strategic investments, particularly in real estate.

Schumer reportedly acquired several properties early in his career, often benefiting from favorable terms. While such practices are not necessarily illegal, they highlight how political influence can open doors to lucrative opportunities.

Additionally, Schumer’s position as Senate Majority Leader has amplified his access to influential networks."

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

 on Thursday. <image:8766>!Getty Images Bill Barr <image:8771>Getty Images

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

 right-wing media supportive of Trump,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 and members of the Trump campaign, such as [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 and [Steve Bannon](/wiki/Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon")
.[\[43\]](#cite_note-43)

### Russian involvement

Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian [GRU](/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation) "GRU (Russian Federation)")
 lieutenant general [Vladimir Alekseyevin](/wiki/Vladimir_Alekseyev_(general) "Vladimir Alekseyev (general)")
, his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov.[\[44\]](#cite_note-44)
 They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers [Oleksandr Dubinsky](/wiki/Oleksandr_Dubinsky "Oleksandr Dubinsky")
 and [Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
, Prosecutor [Kostiantyn Kulyk](/wiki/Kostiantyn_Kulyk "Kostiantyn Kulyk")
 and businessmen [Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 and [Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)

Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

#### Dmytro Firtash

[Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 was a middleman for [Gazprom](/wiki/Gazprom "Gazprom")
 and connected to the Ukrainian government.[\[61\]](#cite_note-61)
 He has acknowledged that he was installed as a middleman by [Russian mob](/wiki/Russian_mob "Russian mob")
 boss [Semion Mogilevich](/wiki/Semion_Mogilevich "Semion Mogilevich")
.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
 to drop charges against Firtash but failed.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

#### Konstantin Kilimnik

[Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
 oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian [Federal Security Service](/wiki/Federal_Security_Service "Federal Security Service")

 Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by [President Putin](/wiki/President_Putin "President Putin")
,[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)
 He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump.[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

### American media involvement

American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 Specifically [Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
,[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)
 [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 [Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")
,[\[69\]](#cite_note-Vicens-2021-69)
 and [One America News Network](/wiki/One_America_News_Network "One America News Network")
[\[70\]](#cite_note-oan_atlantic-70)
 were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory.

#### Peter Schweizer

[Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
, editor-at-large at _[Breitbart News](/wiki/Breitbart_News "Breitbart News")
_ and president of the conservative [Government Accountability Institute](/wiki/Government_Accountability_Institute "Government Accountability Institute")
, was the first person to spread the falsehoods about Joe Biden and Burisma in his book "Secret Empires".[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The plagiarized book[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)
 included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets.[\[72\]](#cite_note-72)
 This, in turn, helped to lead Trump allies in Ukraine[\[73\]](#cite_note-73)
 and Congress to promote the lie.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)

#### John Solomon

_[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington_Post "Washington Post")
_ attributes [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
, formerly of _[The Hill](/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper) "The Hill (newspaper)")
_, the most responsibility[\[75\]](#cite_note-Farhi-2019-75)
 for the spread of the untrue claims in U.S. An internal review by the Hill found "serious doubts about the credibility of Solomon’s Ukrainian sources".[\[77\]](#cite_note-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-78)
 In testimony before Congress, [Alexander Vindman](/wiki/Alexander_Vindman "Alexander Vindman")
 said Solomon's claims were "entirely made up in full cloth".[\[79\]](#cite_note-79)

[Media Matters](/wiki/Media_Matters "Media Matters")
 reported in September 2023 that the previous month Solomon published a State Department briefing memo prepared for Joe Biden's December 2015 trip to Ukraine."

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Content: "They might seek their own nuclear weapons or accommodation with nuclear-armed adversaries such as China and Russia as a result.

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. These differences matter because of the enormous presidential latitude with respect to nuclear decision-making, including presidents’ [sole authority](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf)
 to launch nuclear weapons without authorization from other parts of the government.

While in office, Trump was often confrontational in his dealings with other nuclear powers and was openly skeptical of the alliance relationships that depend on U.S. While valuing a robust deterrent, Biden also has a long-standing commitment to arms control.

What Trump did on nuclear policy while in office
------------------------------------------------

Trump’s [decision](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/)
 to renege on the Iran nuclear deal—despite the [State Department](https://2017-2021.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-18-2017/)
 certifying that Iran was complying with its terms—was likely the most significant nuclear policy decision of his time in office. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President [Joe Biden](https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden)
 has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of [Donald Trump’s return](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter [growing cooperation](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-trade-flights-tourism-ukraine-a6dd64440b4d451026c0bb32d5235a91)
 among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday.

Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. The officials added that Russia has “de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.”

China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with [dual use components](https://apnews.com/article/united-states-china-russia-ukraine-war-265df843be030b7183c95b6f3afca8ec)
 that help keep its military industrial base afloat.

In return, Russia has sent [fighter jets to Iran](https://apnews.com/article/iran-russia-fighter-drone-495c0018a9af2443e767b8ccd39801e4)
 and assisted Tehran as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology.

North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities.  [![AP Logo](https://assets.apnews.com/19/66/bc546486408c8595f01753a9fbeb/ap-logo-176-by-208.svg)](/)
