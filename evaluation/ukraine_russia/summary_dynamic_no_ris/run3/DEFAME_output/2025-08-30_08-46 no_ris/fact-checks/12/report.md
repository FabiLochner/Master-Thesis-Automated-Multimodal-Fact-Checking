## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a London Summit on Ukraine took place on March 2, 2025, and that the image in the claim depicts the participants of the summit. The image search results show multiple photos from the summit, including one that matches the claim's image. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine.

Therefore, while the image is authentic and related to the summit, the claim's description of the leaders taking off their suits is not directly supported by the provided evidence. Additional information would be needed to verify this specific detail.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results do not provide any information about European leaders taking off their suits to support Ukraine. One article from NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-europe-putin-summit-suit-golf-rcna225759](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-europe-putin-summit-suit-golf-rcna225759)) discusses a meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump, and European leaders, but it focuses on Zelenskyy's attire and does not mention the leaders removing their suits. The Daily Mail ([https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15011589/Zelensky-suits-Trump-summit-Ukraine-president-dons-smart-clothes-crunch-talks-disastrous-criticism-White-House-visit.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15011589/Zelensky-suits-Trump-summit-Ukraine-president-dons-smart-clothes-crunch-talks-disastrous-criticism-White-House-visit.html)) also discusses Zelenskyy's attire during a meeting with Trump. ![image 8359](media/2025-08-30_08-48-1756543698-422466.jpg), ![image 8431](media/2025-08-30_08-48-1756543729-929938.jpg), ![image 8432](media/2025-08-30_08-48-1756543730-413246.jpg), ![image 8433](media/2025-08-30_08-48-1756543730-782040.jpg), ![image 8434](media/2025-08-30_08-48-1756543731-416883.jpg), ![image 8435](media/2025-08-30_08-48-1756543731-733314.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is **unverified**. While the image is authentic and depicts the London Summit on Ukraine, there is no evidence to support the assertion that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine. The search results did not provide any information about this specific action.

The image is from the London Summit on Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support the claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine.
