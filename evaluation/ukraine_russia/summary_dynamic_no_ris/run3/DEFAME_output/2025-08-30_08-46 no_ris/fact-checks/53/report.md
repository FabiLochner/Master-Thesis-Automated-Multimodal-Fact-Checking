## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, more than 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" mentions that a British Army official estimated that it would take Russia five years to control four regions, costing Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. The article also states that as of July 29, 2025, 5,432 Russian officers had been killed.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. The article includes a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg), ![image 5](media/6.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: Mediazona, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. The article mentions that in November 2024, male mortality reached a peak of approximately 3,000 deaths per week. The article also states that the date of death is known in 98,340 cases. The last update to the Probate Registry estimate was August 29, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. A Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. However, Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. Another Mediazona article, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed by August 2025.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses aligns with the higher end of the casualty estimates provided by the British Army official. However, the evidence also presents lower figures, such as the Mediazona estimates.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as the evidence provides a range of estimates, and the exact number of losses is not definitively confirmed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://index.minfin.com.ua/en/russian-invading/casualties/): 
Content: The website index.minfin.com.ua provides data on Russian casualties in the war in Ukraine, with the source being the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The site provides cumulative totals and daily updates on military personnel losses. As of August 30, 2025, the estimated number of military personnel losses is approximately 1,081,330. ![image 8803](media/2025-08-30_09-16-1756545386-915588.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is not entirely accurate. While some sources suggest casualty figures that could approach the 1.5 million mark, the most recent official estimate from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as of August 30, 2025, puts the number of military personnel losses at approximately 1,081,330. This suggests that the claim overestimates the losses.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war as of February 2025 is not supported by the available evidence. While some sources provide estimates that could approach this number, the most recent official estimate from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as of August 30, 2025, indicates a lower figure. Therefore, the claim is likely an overestimation. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While some sources suggest casualty figures that could approach 1.5 million, the most recent official estimate from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as of August 30, 2025, puts the number of military personnel losses at approximately 1,081,330 ([Source](https://index.minfin.com.ua/en/russian-invading/casualties/)).
