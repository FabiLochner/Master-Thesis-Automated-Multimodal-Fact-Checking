According to the declaration, Zelenskyy owned fewer than 15 properties, none of them in the U.S., owned no planes and had an annual income of around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. Records searches in Florida's 67 counties revealed no properties in Zelenskyy's name.

51,In February 2025 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared a state of emergency in Germany due to US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. Fact-checks and news articles confirm that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany in February 2025. Instead, he referred to an ""emergency situation"" related to the war in Ukraine, and he was reportedly unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan, as indicated by a Politico article ([https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/)).
","Contrary to the viral claim, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not call for a state of emergency in Germany after Trump’s recent peace talks. A closer review of Scholz’s speech reveals that he referred to “Notlage,” not “Notstand” as claimed. In the video, Scholz said, “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.” In German, “Notstand” means a state of emergency that would severely restrict citizens’ rights. However, “Notlage” appears in the German Basic Law and signifies an urgent situation, but it does not equate to a government-imposed state of emergency.”"
52,"After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.",False,False,True,"Following a phone call on February 12, 2025, between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, peace talks were initiated, as documented on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call) and the [Kremlin website](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259). However, the evidence, including reporting from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call), indicates that an agreement to end the war was not reached on that date, but rather, talks towards a ceasefire were agreed upon later, on March 18, 2025.
","Misbar’s team searched for the claimed statement from Trump but did not find any reports from credible media outlets. However, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he had a call with Putin on February 12, 2025, during which they discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, energy, artificial intelligence, and various other subjects. During the call, both presidents agreed to have their teams start negotiations immediately. Trump said he would call President Zelenskyy to inform him of their decision, which he planned to do while writing the post. Media outlets also reported that Ukraine talks would start, citing Trump’s post, but did not report that Trump had reached an agreement to end the war."
53,"As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.",False,False,True,"The claim is not supported by the evidence. While some sources suggest casualty figures that could approach 1.5 million, the most recent official estimate from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as of August 30, 2025, puts the number of military personnel losses at approximately 1,081,330 ([Source](https://index.minfin.com.ua/en/russian-invading/casualties/)).
","For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term ""lost"" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was ""interested primarily from the standpoint of death,"" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: ""Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months."" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were ""recoverable."" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a ""minimum"" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550."

This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support."
