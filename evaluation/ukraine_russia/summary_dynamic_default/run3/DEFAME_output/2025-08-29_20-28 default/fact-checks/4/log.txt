Content: The image shows coffins draped in the British flag inside a military plane. The greatest loss of life in a single incident took place in September 2006, when 14 servicemen died when their RAF Nimrod spy plane exploded in mid-air. <image:3195>

Content: The image shows a British flag-draped coffin being carried away from a military cargo plane. The image was taken on March 29, 2003, at Brize Norton Royal Air Force Base, England. The coffins were the first of Britain's combat victims to return home from service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. <image:3196>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-photo-coffins-with-british-servicemen-returned-home-from-ukraine/): 
Content: The International Business Times UK published an article about the flag-draped coffins of 14 military personnel killed when an RAF Nimrod aircraft crashed in Afghanistan. <image:3197> The RAF Nimrod crashed on 2 September 2006.

The claim '<image:3> This image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces who were killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts coffins draped in the British flag, but they are associated with events unrelated to the claim, such as the 2006 RAF Nimrod crash, as indicated by the image search results. Furthermore, web search results, such as the one from [UA Wire](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military), debunk claims of British Special Forces casualties in Odesa.

So, the overall veracity is: false
