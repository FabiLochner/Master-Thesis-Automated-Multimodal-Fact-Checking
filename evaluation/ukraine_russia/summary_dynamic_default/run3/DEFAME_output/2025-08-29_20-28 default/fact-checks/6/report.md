The evidence indicates that Ukrainian F-16s have been involved in the war, with at least one crashing in August 2024. The evidence does not mention a US F-16 being shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The image provided does not have enough context to verify the claim.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that F-16s have been involved in the war in Ukraine, with at least one crashing in August 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The image provided does not have enough context to verify the claim.

The claim is not factually accurate because it is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention a US F-16 being shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of Ukrainian F-16s crashing in August 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The provided image lacks sufficient context to verify the claim.
