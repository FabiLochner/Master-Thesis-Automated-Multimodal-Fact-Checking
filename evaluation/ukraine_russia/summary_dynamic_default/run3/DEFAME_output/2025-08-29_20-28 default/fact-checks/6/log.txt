The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of Ukrainian F-16s crashing in August 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that a US F-16 was shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The provided image lacks sufficient context to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
