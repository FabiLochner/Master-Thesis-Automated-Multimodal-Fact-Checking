Useful result: From [Source](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-totally-false-actor-ben-stiller-debunks-claims-usaid-funded-ukraine-trip-231285317684): 
Content: MSNBC's "Morning Joe" published an article titled "'Totally false': Actor Ben Stiller debunks claims USAID funded Ukraine trip". The article debunks a claim, amplified by Elon Musk, that Stiller and other actors were paid millions by USAID for trips to Ukraine. <image:17>

The claim '<image:17> This image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, for which Stiller received $4 million from USAID.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Ben Stiller did meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 20, 2022, as part of his role as a goodwill ambassador for the UNHCR, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he received $4 million from USAID. In fact, Stiller denied receiving any such funding, stating that he self-funded his trip, as reported by sources like [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb).

So, the overall veracity is: false
