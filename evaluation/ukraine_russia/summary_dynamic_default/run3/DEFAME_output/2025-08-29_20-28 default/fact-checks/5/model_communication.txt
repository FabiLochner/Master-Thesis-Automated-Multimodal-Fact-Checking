Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car

Print

washington — 

The article in the Seattle Tribune had everything: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Adolf Hitler and a $15 million classic car. Unsurprisingly, it spread like wildfire across Russia's state and pro-Kremlin media.

But the subject was a strange one for a news site about a U.S. city; such outlets usually cover only local stories.

In fact, the article with headline "Hitler's parade car bought by Ukraine's Zelensky" was another fake spread by Russian propaganda.

There is no such media outlet as the Seattle Tribune, just a website masquerading as a full-fledged publication. And the article itself was a compilation of Russia's disinformation "greatest hits" about Ukraine — "Nazism," "unrestrained corruption" and "wasting American aid."

According to the phony news article, Zelenskyy was spotted in Kyiv exiting a Mercedes-Benz 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, Adolf Hitler's parade car. The sighting supposedly occurred just days after the Ukrainian leader returned from Washington, where the U.S. government had allocated an $8 billion aid package to his country.

The article featured a screenshot of a post by the Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel Realna Viyna ("Real War" in Ukrainian) featuring a photo of the vehicle parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv.

A screenshot of a fake Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel post includes a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

However, beyond the Seattle Tribune news site not actually existing, the article had several other glaring problems.

First, Realna Viyna did not publish the post in the screenshot. Second, the image of "Hitler's car" was stolen from a photo widely available on the internet that was digitally edited into an image of the Ukrainian presidential administration building.

!A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration. <image:164>

A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

VOA found that the angle of photo in the screenshot, a black spot on the asphalt under the car's running board, and the reflection on the front windshield completely match the image of the Mercedes-Benz 770K found across the internet.

Third, the Seattle Tribune website was registered on October 3, 2024, just six days before the fake article was published. And the registration was set for only one year.

The Seattle Tribune appears to belong to a network of disinformation websites controlled by John Mark Dougan, an American living in Russia, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who fact checks and debunks disinformation at the BBC.

He noted on social network X that creating fake local American news sites is Dougan's standard approach. That conclusion matches VOA's observations about Dougan's network.

A former deputy sheriff in Florida, Dougan was charged with extortion and wiretapping in the United States. In 2016, he fled to Russia and later received political asylum there.

He now operates at least 167 disinformation sites that often publish narratives serving Russian interests, according to a May 2024 investigation by [NewsGuard.](https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/special-report-newsguard-and-new-book-expose-global-disinformation-reach-of-moscow-based-former-florida-sheriffs-deputy/)

[Dougan's sites](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)
 previously attracted widespread attention for spreading a fake story claiming that Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, had purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti supercar during a visit to France for commemorations of the D-Day landing.

That story seemed to be aimed at a Western audience. The fake "Hitler car" story, however, is mostly spreading in the Russian information space. In a message on the Telegram messenger, Dougan told VOA that he was unaware of the Seattle Tribune_._

"Never heard of it. But I looked it up \[and\] heard there's lots of great information on there. A real pillar of journalistic integrity, on par with the NYT, CNN and MSNBC," he wrote, referring to _The New York Times_ and two major U.S. TV news channels.

As is often the case with higher-quality fakes, the phony story about Hitler's parade car combines a fictitious narrative about Zelenskyy with real facts about the sale of a former Nazi parade car in the United States.

The factual information comes from an article in a real American newspaper: _The Seattle Times,_ which reported in February 2018 that [the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-hitlers-car-ended-up-parked-in-medina/)
 after having been put up for auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, a month earlier.

While the vehicle did not sell at the auction, it soon found a buyer. After that, the "Hitler car" was briefly unloaded from a truck in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Medina, where it attracted the attention of a local resident, who told _The Seattle Times_ about it. Later, the car was likely reloaded onto the truck and taken way.

The director of the auction company Worldwide Auctioneers, Rod Egan (his name was also mentioned in the fake Seattle Tribune story), refused to tell _The Seattle Time_s the buyer of the car, citing a non-disclosure agreement.

However, Egan said the car's ultimate destination was "very, very far away" outside the United States.

_The Seattle Times_ article also cited a German media report that six such cars were bought by a Russian billionaire in 2009. Among them was the vehicle mentioned in the fake article.

The fake story about Zelenskyy and the "Hitler car" also recalled a scene from the 2001 American comedy film "Rat Race," in which actor Jon Lovitz steals Hitler's parade car from a fictional museum of Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie and then crashes it into a gathering of American World War II veterans.

Asked whether he was familiar with the film and scene, Dougan replied, "Comedy gold right there."

Russian media spread hoax about Zelensky buying Hitler’s car for $15 million
============================================================================

11 October 2024

[](/en/authors/the-insider)

[##### The Insider](/en/authors/the-insider)

[**_RU_**](https://theins.press/antifake/275180)

A series of fake publications about President Volodymyr Zelensky's alleged multi-million dollar purchases — including a hotel with a casino in Northern Cyprus, a winery in Tuscany that belonged to a famous British musician, and a brand new Bugatti for Ukraine’s First Lady — has been updated with an unbelievable new addition: the story that Zelensky has ostensibly purchased Adolf Hitler's parade car and drives it around Kyiv. The Russian tabloid _Moskovsky Komsomolets_ ”[reports](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/10/08/zelenskiy-kupil-mersedes-gitlera-za-astronomicheskuyu-summu.html)
”:

> “Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased a car that belonged to Adolf Hitler. The Nazi Fuhrer rode in this Mercedes at the parade in Berlin after the surrender of France in 1940. The purchase was reported by _Seattle Tribune_.

> “As the publication writes, the car was noticed in the center of Kyiv in early October. It had brought Zelensky to the administration building on Bankova Street. This happened shortly after Zelensky returned from his American tour.

> “The article says that the amount Zelensky paid for the Mercedes-Benz 770k is unknown, but experts estimate its value as approximately $15 million. The Nazi dictator's car was confiscated by the U.S. Army after the war ended.”

_Argumenty i Fakty_ throws in some [details](https://aif.ru/politics/world/seattle-tribune-zelenskiy-kupil-paradnyy-limuzin-gitlera)
:

> “The United States attempted to auction the car in 2018. The endeavor failed because the $7 million bid fell short of the expected value. Subsequently, representatives stated they were negotiating the sale of the car with a client outside the U.S.”

![](/images/PJA9qLuVPnDCVQFT36GVoRhJDpYG41YEEmwqC8KGZzk/rs:fill:433:562:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5NzYv/ZmlsZS00NzdjMDlh/MGQ3NGVlMjEyNTRl/NmU4NDI0ZjU5Mjdl/Zi5qcGc.jpg)

The failed 2018 auction story is true — except that the negotiations did in fact end in February 2022, with the car being [purchased](https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/australian-politician-clive-palmer-buys-hitlers-mercedes-from-russian-tycoon-hlzpn20vf)
 by Australian national Clive Palmer for his future car museum. According to _The Times_, its previous owner was a Russian tycoon who had bought the car for more than $7 million. However, after Palmer was suspected in Australia of violating the anti-Russian sanctions regime and glorifying Nazism, he [denied](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-02/clive-palmer-reportedly-buys-hitlers-car/100874720)
 the purchase.

_Seattle Tribune_, which first wrote about Zelensky's purchase of the car, is one of many fake publications created to plant dirt against Putin’s enemies. Olena Zelenska's fictional purchase of a Bugatti was reported by the non-existent French publication _Vérité Cachée_ in July 2024 using a similar method. The website of _Seattle Tribune_ was registered just a few days ago, and the Internet Archive [shows](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003162854/https:/seattle-tribune.com/)
 that on Oct. 3, 2024, it was completely empty.

![](/images/n_infmIDLGIc64dpaqUUZFl0ar-9-4ysK9mh30_K6v0/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzcv/ZmlsZS0yNzVhNzRh/MTg4MzVlYWZlZmZl/MDRmMDk2MDdlNGM0/YS5qcGc.jpg)

The pseudo-American publication [presents](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
 a screenshot ostensibly captured from the Ukrainian Telegram channel “Real War | Ukraine | News” with a photo of a car outside the Ukrainian president's office building.

![](/images/BKCFlFjgqajb2a869v73hlrvaWyQRlD2DYAySfdwh9A/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzgv/ZmlsZS01ZTgzNWU0/OTliZGNhMzc5NjQz/MjQ3YzIzNGNmYzcx/OC5qcGc.jpg)

Of course, the channel published no such post, and the image itself was doctored. The car was cut from a photo that [illustrated](https://ru.axar.az/news/vmire/235827.html)
 the auction announcements on various websites in 2017.

![](/images/jImvSXip56iyK9-6Y6tFeFIZ5IH0sg4LmaY1Wiy8Xwg/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzkv/ZmlsZS02NDA5ZWM2/OTM2YmJhYzJjZTc4/ZDdjMjExN2E2M2Q3/Yy5qcGc.jpg)

As we can see, tree reflections in the fenders of the car in the two images match — and there are no trees this big anywhere near the building on Bankova Street. The authors of the hoax only tried to blur the reflection of the American police car in the door, and they weren't too thorough about it, leaving visible traces of the partially erased reflection. The license plates are blurred too — an understandable move for the original 2017 photo, when the car belonged to a private owner — but why would one care to hide the license plates of a presidential car that Zelensky purportedly uses to get to his office and drive around Kyiv?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is once again the target of disinformation for allegedly spending money intended for the Ukrainian Army. This time, it is claimed he bought the famous Mercedes-Benz 770, whose most famous owner was Hitler. The claims come from the “news portal” Seattle Tribune, created a few days before the breaking news, while the main source is a manipulated screenshot from Telegram. Not only such a photo does not exist on the Telegram group that is quoted, the illustration is also a montage of two different pictures. This new attack on Zelensky comes only a few days after his visit to the United States, where he presented his “Victory Plan”

Disinformation attacks on Ukrainian President **Volodymyr** **Zelensky** have been a constant since the war in Ukraine started. This time, it is claimed he allegedly bought the “Mercedes-Benz 770” car or the “Großer Mercedes” (the “Grand Mercedes”) of the infamous dictator of Nazi Germany, **Adolf Hitler,** for 15 million dollars**.** It is true the “Mercedes-Benz 770” was one of the most famous and most used models in the ranks of the Nazi Party in Germany and that it was this car which Hitler used for the [victory parade in France](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html#:~:text=Hitler%20used%20it%20for%20a%20victory%20parade%20after%20the%20Nazis%E2%80%99%20swift%20defeat%20of%20France)
. However, as early as 2018, the car was auctioned in [Arizona, USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html)
. This disinformation was also fact-checked by numerous colleagues from Lithuania ([15min](https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/pasaulis/ar-tiesa-kad-v-zelenskis-isigijo-a-hitlerio-automobili-57-2323218)

, [Australia](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/russian-disinformation-campaign-accuses-zelensky-of-spending-millions-on-cars/)
, as well as the diplomatic service of the EU, [EUvsDisinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/zelenskyy-buys-hitlers-mercedes/)

“The news” has started to spread relatively quickly in the Baltic states and Ukraine, with a picture or [video](https://www.facebook.com/psimeonoff/videos/570591355306096)
 being shared, as well as a direct link from the website [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
, which at first sight resembles a real news portal.

**Photo: Screenshot from [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
**

However, numerous problematic moments surrounding the portal can be recognized immediately. Firstly, according to the [US Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn87093403/)
, the weekly newspaper “Seattle Tribune” was founded in 1931 and it is not known exactly when in the last century it was shut down. Consequently, no data can be found on whether the portal with the same name, created later on, has anything to do with the original.

Secondly, since the site is first registered [on the 3rd of October, 2024](https://who.is/whois/seattle-tribune.com)
, a few days before the breaking news about Zelensky was published, it is very suspicious. There is no Impressum on the website, nor are there links to the journalists who write the news, the date the news was published or any other information about the portal itself. This is clear indication that this site impersonates a real news portal through which vectors of disinformation attacks are created, which is [a well-known tactic.](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)

It is also suspicious how the main source of this news is actually a screenshot from a channel on the Telegram platform, called [“Реальна Війна”](https://t.me/s/voynareal)
 or Real War (there is no link to the Telegram post).

**Photo: manipulated picture from Seattle Tribune, allegedly sourced from the Telegram group “Real War”** 

The picture itself, portraying the “Mercedes”, allegedly parked in front of the Presidential Palace of Ukraine, is obvious to be altered with at least two pictures.

One of the pictures, from the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, can be found on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/images/kiev-ukraine-august-04-2021-office-building-of-the-president-of-ukraine-city-of-kyiv/482821474?prev_url=detail)
 — a site for downloading photos for commercial use. The other, can be found on the [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/859132066386149502/)
 platform. The photo manipulation is done so that the photo of the car is superimposed over the other photo of the palace. The same reflections can be seen from the fenders of the “Mercedes” and the hood. Moreover, the picture shows the weather was sunny, or at least clear. Meanwhile, on the 6th of October, when this disinformation actually began to be spread, the weather forecast for Kyiv indicated [record rainfall.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-regions/3913586-u-kievi-6-zovtna-zafiksuvali-rekordnu-kilkist-opadiv.html)

#### **Inspiration behind the disinformation**  

As in all previous cases when Zelensky and his family members were the [target of disinformation](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)
, it was usually preceded by an important event that will wake up the Russian propagandists in order to distract attention elsewhere. More specifically, to undermine the trust not only of the citizens of Ukraine, but also of politicians and allies from the USA and the West who supply them with financial and military aid. And with that, prolong or block the help they are receiving, as was the case during the winter with the [US Congress.](https://vistinomer.mk/ruski-razorni-dezinformacii-ja-potpaluvaat-amerikanskata-politichka-scena/)

This time, the possible reason might be that one week before the website Seattle Tribune was created, Zelensky was in the United States. More specifically, on the 23rd of September he was in the state of [Pennsylvania](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/europe/ukraine-zelensky-pennsylvania-us-visit-intl-hnk/index.html)
, where he visited an ammunition factory, while a few days later, on the 26th of September, he presented his [“Victory Plan”](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240926-ukraine-will-prevail-joe-biden-tells-volodymyr-zelensky-after-pledging-8-billion-in-military-aid-to-kyiv)
 in the Oval Office in the White House.

On another note, six times just this year, Truthmeter.mk has fact-checked different disinformation surrounding the alleged luxuries of Zelensky, according to which, it turns out he has allegedly spent over one billion dollars intended as aid for the Ukrainian Army.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

Recovery operations at the site of a building hit in Russia's attack on July 8, 2024. (Interior Ministry / Telegram)

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)
, Ukraine's largest children's medical center, which Russia [directly targeted](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-struck-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-following-programmed-route-source-says/)
.

The Russian military struck the children's [hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/who-data-suggest-more-ukrainians-could-die-in-medical-site-attacks-in-2024/)
 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)
 (SBU), killing at least two people and injuring at least 50.

Russia launched [**another attack**](https://kyivindependent.com/latest-russian-attack-on-kyiv-hits-maternity-hospital-4-killed/)
 against Kyiv later during the day, with debris damaging a maternity hospital in another district, killing seven people.

Russian Federation’s Attack on Ukrainian Children’s Hospital ‘Not Only a War Crime’ but ‘Far Beyond the Limits of Humanity’, Medical Director Tells Security Council
====================================================================================================================================================================

‘There Has Been No Respite for Civilians in Ukraine’, Says Humanitarian Official

Amid a wave of the Russian Federation’s deadly missile attacks, targeting multiple cities across Ukraine on 8 July — including a strike that hit the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv — the United Nations top humanitarian official warned against a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health-care and other civilian infrastructure.

“There has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine”, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, adding that she was “shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”.  In Kyiv, the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital were severely damaged, and its toxicology department — where children receive dialysis — was destroyed.  “Russia started this war and Russia can end it at any time”, she underscored, reaffirming support for Ukraine.

The representative of the United Kingdom said that, in its repeated attacks against Ukraine since 23 February 2022, the Russian Federation has killed, maimed and abducted Ukrainian children.  Further, on 8 July, it attacked a children’s hospital. “This is cowardly depravity, and this must stop”, she underscored, stating that the intentional direction of attacks against civilian populations and objects constitutes a war crime. Stressing that Moscow’s conduct “is a disgrace to the Security Council and, especially, to the President’s seat”, she urged those present to jointly condemn the Russian Federation’s actions. For its part, the United Kingdom and its partners “will continue to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself from these barbaric acts of violence” and — at the ongoing summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — “will demonstrate our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes”.  Moscow must end its aggression against Ukraine and withdraw its forces.  “And stop killing Ukrainian children”, she added.

The representative of Japan lamented that the Council met “once again to confront the grim reality” caused by the Russian Federation’s escalating attacks across Ukraine, including a barrage of missiles that caused serious damage and many casualties at a pediatric hospital in Kyiv.  She wished that the children there would get prompt and appropriate care.  The Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) is verifying figures while rescue workers, hospital staff and volunteers continue to clear rubble in search of people trapped under debris. Health officials report that what remains of the children’s hospital is without electricity, preventing the use of ventilators and other urgent care.  UN Human Rights staff has helped move child patients to other facilities while providing psychosocial support and assisting with other urgent needs. She also highlighted “a massive outpouring of solidarity” from local residents, who rushed to the scene to help remove rubble and provide blankets, water and food for patients and medical staff. Furthermore, at least seven civilians were killed at the ISIDA medical centre in Kyiv — one of Ukraine’s largest women’s health and family planning centres — when debris from an intercepted missile hit the facility.

“Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”, she asserted, adding that these incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health care and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Attacks have intensified since the spring of 2024.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022.  Multilateral efforts that preserve diplomatic frameworks are the best way to achieve concrete solutions, he said.

The representative of Malta, noting that the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital is a beneficiary of the technical cooperation programme run by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that the missile attack against it “not only endangers lives, but also constitutes a violation of IAEA’s core principles and values”.  Health and educational facilities “must always be protected” to ensure uninterrupted delivery of their services to all people in Ukraine, she stressed, calling for the immediate cessation of all attacks against hospitals, residential buildings and critical infrastructure in Ukraine and on all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law.  The attacks on 8 July took place amidst Moscow’s new military offensive in the Kharkiv region, but attacks throughout 2024 have endangered the lives of thousands of children, health-care workers and civilians. Against that backdrop, she stressed: “The perpetrators of these actions must be held accountable for the damage done.”

The representative of Mozambique said that civilian deaths, both intentional and incidental, must not be condoned, urging warring parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  The respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be upheld under any circumstance.  Okhmatdyt Hospital was just one of many targets in the heavy missile strike which hit Kyiv and other cities on 8 July, he said, noting that the Russian Federation launched 38 missiles, attacking almost 100 civilian sites.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022, she asserted that “intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”.

Describing the 8 July attack on the children’s hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir, the Director of Okhmatdyt, said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  “At 10:42 a.m.  Describing the 8 July attack on the facility, he said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  Noting ongoing negotiations regarding Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee deep in children's blood in the chair’s seat here?”  The representative of the Russian Federation will bypass purgatory and end up in hell forever, he said, calling on the Council to respond to that country’s aggression and war crimes as well as address the issue of its presence in the permanent seat of the Soviet Union.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that the Russian Federation’s recent large-scale missile attacks are “a stark reminder” of why the Russian Federation Armed Forces are listed by the UN as a perpetrator of grave violations against children.  He stressed: “By targeting Okhmatdyt — a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine — Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and its utter insincerity about peace talks.”  Further, he pointed to the “striking paradox” of a Member State currently holding the presidency of the Council — the organ responsible for maintaining peace and security — while intensifying, “as we speak”, attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  Citing an OHCHR report documenting Moscow’s targeting of energy infrastructure and use of “double-tap” strikes, he stressed:  “These are the facts.”

Against that backdrop, he underscored that the Russian Federation and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression and for other serious international crimes — “as well as for the massive damage caused by their war”.  The General Assembly will soon vote on a resolution regarding the threats posed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as this marks the first time in history that a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been illegally seized by a foreign aggressor.  “History matters here”, he stressed, stating that history — including the 1986 Chernobyl disaster — teaches the existential importance of nuclear safety and security. “Russia’s irresponsible actions place all of us at risk, and that is why we hope — and expect — that all UN Member States will support this initiative”, he urged.

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation forces have targeted the largest Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia, the largest Ukrainian water dam in Khakovka and now Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in Kyiv.  He cited estimates by media experts that the Kremlin spent as much as $250 million on Monday’s missile barrage against targets in several Ukrainian cities.  Instead of using the money to treat their own children, Moscow “prefers to spend hundreds of millions on killing children in Ukraine”.  “We must move from the logic of domination and force to the logic of diplomacy and the peaceful solution of the conflict”, he said.

Along similar lines, the speaker for Sierra Leone underlined that the devastating impact of the reported overnight missile strikes on civilians is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the violence to end and a renewed commitment to protecting civilian lives and infrastructure in conflict zones.  “It also begs for independent investigations”, he said, urging the involved parties to “choose and prioritize peace”.

On 8 July, Moscow deliberately targeted “perhaps the most vulnerable and defenceless group in any society — children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses”, said Ukraine’s delegate.  Holding up images of the missile’s flight trajectory, as well as pictures of missile fragments retrieved from under the hospital, he said the footage shows that the hospital was a deliberate target.  Turning to ongoing negotiations regarding the Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee-deep in children’s blood in the Chair’s seat here?”

Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to counter that a missile from the Ukrainian air defence hit the children’s hospital in an attempt to intercept a Russian missile that was meant to hit a factory.  He pointed out that this tragedy — which falls within the pattern of Ukrainian and Western propaganda — occurred on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit.  “If this was a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building and all the children would have been killed and not wounded”, he said, emphasizing that Moscow does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Kyiv hospital boss describes 'real hell' of missile attack

Hospital personnel and volunteers formed a human chain to clear the rubble after Kyiv's Ohmatdyt children's hospital was hit

The director of Ukraine's largest children's hospital, hit on Monday by a deadly missile strike blamed on Russia, has said the attack was "real hell".

"Children and adults screamed in fear, wounded from pain" in Kyiv's Ohmadyt hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir told the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

He said more than 1,200 patients and personnel were in the hospital at the time and three heart surgeries were being carried out. Two adults were killed and more than 300 people injured, including children, he added.

On Tuesday, Ukraine published photos of what it said were recovered fragments of a Russian cruise missile that hit the hospital in the capital.

Russia claimed the blast was caused by a misfiring Ukrainian air defence missile, but the UN said it was highly likely Moscow was behind the attack - a conclusion shared by analysts who spoke to BBC Verify.

Ohmatdyt child patients - many of them on drips - were evacuated to other hospitals

The attack was globally condemned, with US President Joe Biden saying it was a "horrific reminder of Russia's brutality".

Mr Biden, who is hosting a Nato summit in Washington on Tuesday, also vowed to strengthen Kyiv's air defences.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is attending the summit, said: "We are fighting for more air defence systems for Ukraine... We are fighting for more planes."

At least 46 people - including 33 in Kyiv - were killed across Ukraine in a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes on Monday, local officials said.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko declared 9 July as a day of mourning in the city.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

CNN on scene of Ukrainian children's hospital struck by missile

CNN on scene of Ukrainian children's hospital struck by missile

01:49

CNN  — 

Ukraine’s [largest children’s hospital](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/ukraine-russian-strike-childrens-hospital-intl/index.html)
 likely took a direct hit from a Russian missile on Monday, a United Nations assessment has found, as NATO agreed to strengthen Kyiv’s air defenses in the wake of the attack.

Russia has repeatedly denied targeting the hospital in Kyiv and alleged, without evidence, that a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile caused the blast. But a UN human rights official said evidence suggested Moscow’s forces were responsible for the deadly strike.

“Analysis of the video footage and assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children’s hospital suffered a direct hit rather than receiving damages due to an intercepted weapons system,” Danielle Bell, head of the UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told reporters Tuesday.

Bell said [the attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/zelensky-modi-putin-visit-hospital-strike-intl-hnk/index.html)
 damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards at Kyiv’s [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2022/03/03/ukraine-children-hospital-shelling-underground-lead-ward-pkg-vpx.cnn)
, which has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country, adding that Ukrainian officials have since transferred 600 children to other hospitals.

“This terrible attack shows that nowhere is safe in Ukraine,” Bell added.

The UN assessment tallies with weapons experts, who told CNN that it was highly likely a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile struck the children’s hospital in Kyiv on Monday.

Reviewing video footage that CNN had verified and geolocated and images of fragments from the scene, weapons experts said that evidence strongly suggests the hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile as opposed to a Ukrainian air defense projectile.

Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CNN Wednesday that the flight profile in the footage of the missile hitting the hospital is “exactly correct for the Kh-101, with the right dive angle, under power and not tumbling or falling like a spent air-defence missile might.” The silhouette of the rocket visible in the footage also matches the Kh-101, Bronk said.

Two adults were killed in the strike and 16 others - including seven children - were injured, according to Ukrainian officials, as Russia launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across [Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people in total.

The strikes across Ukraine were “strongly” condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, while the UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk called for “prompt, thorough and independent investigations” into the attacks.

The Russian attacks came as [NATO leaders gathered](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/zelensky-ukraine-nato-summit/index.html)
 in Washington, where the United States and NATO allies agreed to give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen Kyiv’s air defenses, members of the defense alliance said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

US President Joe Biden [also announced plans](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/biden-nato-summit-ukraine-aid/index.html)
 to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit – providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia’s invasion.

During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that “the United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.”

‘Targeted attack by Russia’
---------------------------

Images and video from the aftermath of the strike on the Kyiv hospital show children with cancer being treated outside the facility and an injured toddler with blood on his face and arms.

A [CNN team at the site](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/world/video/ukraine-children-hospital-missile-strike-ldn-digvid)
 on Tuesday said the level of destruction there showed how forceful the explosion must have been. Always.”

On Tuesday, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia reiterated Moscow’s denial that it had targeted the children’s hospital.

“We have not bombed the children’s hospital,” Nebenzia said at a special meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) convened following the attack. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UNSC meeting that the Russian “attack makes abundantly clear: Putin is not interested in peace.”

Kyiv described the strike as a “targeted attack by Russia,” with the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) saying a Russian long-range cruise missile struck the facility.

“Relevant evidence has already been found at the scene of the tragedy: in particular, fragments of the rear part of the Kh-101 missile with a serial number and part of the steering wheel of the same missile,” the SBU said.

SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk vowed the agency would respond to what he said were Russian war crimes.

“This retribution will be both legal and moral,” he said.

The UN’s monitoring mission said it was likely that a KH-101 cruise missile launched by Russia struck the children’s hospital. It made the determination “based on video footage, which shows the technical specification of the type of weapon that was used” and that such footage “shows the weapon directly impacting the hospital rather than being intercepted in the air,” Bell said.

A military expert who visited the site following the blast said the damage is “consistent with a direct hit,” according to Bell.

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/zelensky-modi-putin-visit-hospital-strike-intl-hnk/index.html)
 said in Washington on Tuesday that “Russia always knows where its missiles hit. In Kyiv, residential buildings, infrastructure facilities and children’s hospital ‘Okhmatdyt’ were damaged. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded.”

But the US also blamed Russia for the hospital strike."

Responding to the latest, particularly heavy Russian missile strikes that have killed dozens of civilians across Ukraine and hit major medical facilities in Kyiv, including five buildings of a children’s hospital, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:

“The destruction of hospitals, as well as residential buildings and essential infrastructure are abhorrent, and any acts that target or disregard civilians must be unequivocally condemned. In Kryvyi Rih, at least 10 civilians were killed and over 30 injured, and other casualties reported across the country.

The first missile strike to hit Kyiv destroyed a large part of Ohmatdyt, a major children’s hospital, damaging its five buildings. Russian attempts to put the blame on Ukrainian air defence display a callous audacity, which seeks to deflect from Russia’s responsibility for killing civilians and destroying medical facilities.

> The chilling images we have seen from the sites of two rounds of attacks in Kyiv today are a reminder of the cruelty of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
> 
> Marie Struthers

“The chilling images we have seen from the sites of two rounds of attacks in Kyiv today are a reminder of the cruelty of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. This tragic day must serve as yet another urgent alarm for the entire international community, that immediate and effective action is needed for justice to be served.”

**Background**

According to Ukrainian authorities, Russia launched over 40 missiles against cities and towns across Ukraine earlier today.

At least 22 civilians were reportedly killed in Kyiv while as many as 72 were injured. The follow-up strike partly demolished another building in Kyiv, where the maternity hospital Isida and Adonis medical centre are located, killing at least seven people. The number of civilians killed across the country is growing all the time, including in other missile strikes today, on Kryvyi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro, Kramatorsk, and Slovyansk.

“These brutal acts will not stop until those committing crimes under international law know that they will be held individually responsible."

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

We have some more comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at [the joint press conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff#block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff)
 with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv.

“Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. At a press conference in Oslo, reported on by the news agency AFP, and a day before he receivs the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Tanaka added: “Nuclear weapons are things which must never be used.”

We have some more comments from **Friedrich Merz**, frontrunner in the race to become Germany’s next chancellor, who is on a visit to Kyiv today to meet [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
.

Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), used the trip to condemn his country’s policy on arming [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 as akin to making the country fight with one arm tied behind its back.

German chancellor [Olaf Scholz has resisted Zelenskyy’s requests for Germany’s Taurus cruise missile](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/04/uk-urges-germany-to-give-long-range-missiles-to-kyiv-despite-luftwaffe-leak)
, whose range and power he fears would dramatically escalate the conflict and potentially drag Germany into it more directly. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

FOREIGN TROOPS
--------------

Zelenskiy also returned to an idea raised in February by Macron, who floated the possibility of European nations [sending troops to Ukraine](/world/europe/paris-conference-belie-doom-gloom-ukraine-elysee-says-2024-02-25/)

The U.S. He suggested that some part of troops of a country be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee us security while Ukraine is not in NATO," Zelenskiy said.

"But we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO," he added.

Kyiv, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join NATO, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion once the current hostilities are halted.

"If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had the invitation, and we would not be in NATO, and there will be a pause, then who guarantees us any kind of security?" Zelenskiy asked at the press conference.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon its NATO ambitions and sees Kyiv's membership of the alliance as an unacceptable security threat.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping to call outgoing U.S. We do seek it," Zelenskiy told reporters in Kyiv on Monday.

Zelenskiy's spokesperson Serhiy Nikiforov said later that Kyiv was preparing a December meeting of key European partners who together with the U.S. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," Zelenskiy said.

Zelenskyy says he is open to negotiated end to war with Russia

Print

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday he is open to the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the country’s war with Russia.

"Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. We do seek it," the Ukrainian president said Monday at a joint press conference in Kyiv with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz.

Zelenskyy also said he is open to the possibility of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine to help his country end its war with Russia, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly three years.

"But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

On his Telegram channel, the Ukrainian leader said the deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a step forward for the Eastern European country’s quest to join NATO.

Zelenskyy’s openness to a negotiated end to the conflict with Russia and the presence of Western troops in Ukraine coincides with Russia’s recent gains in Ukraine and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. Stories with the VOA News byline are the work of multiple VOA journalists and may contain information from wire service reports.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with Friedrich Merz, chairman of the German Christian Democratic Party, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Dec. President-elect Donald Trump.

Trump met with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he plans to call U.S. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today — while he is not yet in the White House,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump has said he wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly and has called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

However, Zelenskyy told the _New York Post_ that while Trump wants a ceasefire, the two leaders have not discussed any details about that arrangement.

Merz, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's challenger in the upcoming German election, said at the joint address with Zelenskyy that the “basic consensus” in Germany is that Germany will continue to supply Ukraine with military aid.

In his meetings with Zelenskyy, Merz did, however, note that Germany’s position on Ukraine differs from the stance that France, the U.S. Two of the drones were destroyed over Astrakhan, located about 200 kilometers from the border.

'No going into Nato by Ukraine,' says Trump as Zelensky prepares for White House talks
======================================================================================

Watch: How Friday's Trump-Putin summit unfolded... in under 2 minutes

Donald Trump has said the Ukrainian president can end Russia's war "if he wants to", but there will be "no going into Nato by Ukraine" as part of a peace deal.

Hours before he was due to host Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, Trump also said there would be "no getting back" the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, eight years before launching its full-scale invasion.

Trump's remarks follow his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska that resulted in the US president dropping a demand for a ceasefire and calling instead for a permanent peace deal.

After arriving in the US late on Sunday, Zelensky repeated his call for allies' effective security guarantees.

A US envoy said on Sunday that Putin had agreed to a possible Nato-like security pact for Ukraine.

The Russian president has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining the military alliance.

Deadly Russian attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities continued hours before the summit in Washington - killing at least 10 people, including children.

In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, at least seven people were killed after a Russian drone hit an apartment block, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Some things never change!!!" Trump added.

The president's assertion is untrue: At least two Ukrainian soldiers are known to have been shot dead by Russian forces in Crimea in 2014.

The Ukrainian naval vessel Cherkasy, a minesweeper, was also attacked by Russian forces when trying to leave the area.

Before Trump's return to power in January, Nato countries agreed on Kyiv's "irreversible path" to membership in the alliance.

Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, alongside European leaders including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, will join Zelensky in Washington for talks on Ukraine's future on Monday.

Also attending are French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. "Just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022".

February's row between Zelensky, Vance and Trump

For so many heads of state to travel with such little notice across the Atlantic to what is essentially a wartime crisis meeting appears without precedent in the modern era, underscoring the sky-high stakes.

Diplomatic sources say European officials are concerned that Trump may try to press Zelensky to agree to terms, after the Ukrainian leader was excluded from the Trump-Putin meeting on US soil last Friday.

But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the BBC's US partner CBS that any suggestion Zelensky might be bullied by Trump into accepting a peace deal was a "stupid media narrative".

Nato leaders also appear eager to avoid a repeat of Zelensky's February trip to the Oval Office that ended abruptly after an argument with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance.

The altercation - which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of "gambling with World War Three" - left Washington-Kyiv ties in tatters.

But European leaders have been working diligently behind the scenes since then to mend the relationship. <image:5619>!EPA European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky attend a video conference with EU leaders in Brussels, Belgium, on 17 August 2025 <image:5620>EPA

Zelensky joined a virtual summit on Sunday with Nato and European leaders

A virtual summit was held on Sunday between Zelensky and the so-called coalition of the willing - a group of nations including the UK, France and Germany that have pledged to protect peace in Ukraine once it is achieved.

Afterwards, Emmanuel Macron told reporters their plan was to "present a united front" for Monday's talks with Trump.

Zelensky and the Nato leaders said they were keen to learn more after US envoy Steve Witkoff told US television that Putin had agreed on Friday to "robust security guarantees that I would describe as game-changing".

Witkoff said such an agreement could see Europe and the US protect Ukraine from further aggression with a Nato-like defence agreement.

"We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato," Witkoff told CNN on Sunday.

Putin has long opposed Ukraine joining Nato, and Witkoff said the arrangement could be an alternative if the Ukrainians "can live with it".

Article 5 is a principle at the heart of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance that says its members will come to the defence of an ally that is under attack.

Witkoff also told CNN that Russia made "some concessions" around five heavily contested regions of Ukraine.

In talks with European allies after the Alaska summit, Trump said Putin had reiterated that he wants the key Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up Donbas, eastern Ukraine, according to European officials.

But at Sunday's virtual summit with Nato leaders, Zelensky stressed that the Ukrainian constitution makes it impossible to give up territory - and that this should only be discussed by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at a trilateral summit with the US.

The US secretary of state, meanwhile, sought to temper hopes that a deal to end Europe's deadliest conflict for 80 years could be imminent.

"We're still a long ways off," Rubio said on Sunday.

_with additional reporting by Vitaliy Shevchenko, Russia editor at BBC Monitoring._

! That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings," he said.

*   [In maps: War-ravaged Ukrainian territories](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrn433lk2o)
    

Earlier, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, saying: "President Zelensky of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.

"Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. It is unclear how many of them will go to the White House.

Trump later added: "Big day at the White House tomorrow. My great honor to host them!!!"

Zelensky posted on social media saying he was "grateful" for Trump's invitation. The Ukrainian leader has been coached to talk in terms of deal-making - language that resonates with Trump.

In April, Ukraine signed a minerals agreement that gave the US a financial stake in the country, and Trump and Zelensky spoke privately at the Vatican before Pope Francis's funeral."

Days after [meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.cfr.org/article/what-expect-trump-putin-alaska-summit "meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin")
, President Donald Trump convened a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House on Monday. They appeared perfectly happy to basically adopt the line: Russia is strong, Ukraine is weak, Russia is winning this war, so Ukraine should make a deal now and cut their losses by doing a few “land swaps” in a very dishonest and disproportionate way.

As far as I can tell, Russia is willing to give up very, very little, and is basically saying, “Okay, if you agree to this, we have peace, and then you’ll get some sort of vague security guarantee from the United States, something written, but ill-defined.” Zelenskyy clearly avoided that tenor in today’s meeting.

### Zelenskyy was joined in Washington by some key European leaders, including several who are considered to be “Trump whisperers.” Why did the Europeans feel compelled to have such a shared showing at the White House?

After all the goodwill from the NATO summit meeting at The Hague in June, the Europeans clearly thought they were well positioned with the president. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

[What to Expect From the Trump-Putin Alaska Summit](/article/what-expect-trump-putin-alaska-summit)

### This meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in the Oval Office contrasted significantly with their last one. What does that indicate about the tenor and the direction of the talks?

On a more superficial level, Zelenskyy clearly learned from the first meeting—the famous Oval Office meeting in February—and for that matter, so did the Trump administration. There were also some Trump whisperers—NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Finland President Alexander Stubb (his golf partner), and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni—who are closer to the president ideologically, or at least willing to step up the flattery.

When it comes to the other leaders of Europe, you really run the gamut from the Labour-left in the United Kingdom to a kind of traditional center-right, Christian Democrat in Germany, and a liberal centrist in France. He wants to be an honest broker, a peacemaker between Russia and Ukraine, claiming that he now gets along very well with both leaders.

### Trump floated that the United States could be involved in providing Ukraine security guarantees that would be similar to NATO’s Article Five. Until it is, it’s going to be very hard for Ukraine to make any serious concessions.

**Among Trump’s next objectives is to have a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy and Putin, which he said is now a matter of “when, not if” it will occur."

Boyechko added: “Monday is the day when Ukraine and its European allies must recognise the urgent need to develop their own strategy to defend Ukraine and secure peace in Europe – because it is increasingly likely that Trump will walk away from the peace negotiations.”

Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agreed that any future Ukraine peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”.

Zelenskyy accuses Russia of ‘cynical’ attacks before Washington talks
=====================================================================

Ukrainian president says latest strikes have killed at least 10 people and intended to ‘humiliate diplomatic efforts’

*   [Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/18/ukraine-war-live-update-russia-zelenskyy-washington-trump-europe-meeting-talks-latest-news)
      
    

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of trying to humiliate Ukraine and Europe by “deliberately killing civilians” before talks with Donald Trump in the White House to be attended by Ukraine’s president and a group of European leaders.

Zelenskyy described the latest strikes by Moscow on four Ukrainian cities as “demonstrative and cynical”. “\[Vladimir\] Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts.”

He said Ukraine required an end to the war, reliable security guarantees, and a just and “dignified peace”, adding: “Moscow must hear the word stop.”

Russia’s latest attacks come amid signs that Trump is likely to put pressure on Zelenskyy to accept a peace deal in which [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 would gain land it has been unable since 2014 to occupy. The US president has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join Nato or retake Russian-occupied Crimea as part of the negotiations.

Hours before he was due to meet the leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the EU and Nato, Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a “big day at the White House”.

He added: “We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. President DJT.”

In another post on Sunday night, Trump said Zelenskyy could “end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. The UK was no longer pushing for an immediate ceasefire, Downing Street added.

The prime minister and European leaders are keen to avoid a repeat of the public mauling of Zelenskyy during his [previous trip to the White House](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-shouting-match-oval-office)

Arriving in Washington late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hoped Ukraine’s “shared strength” with the US and European counterparts would compel Russia to peace.

“I am grateful to the president of the United States for the invitation. “And I hope that our shared strength with America and with our European friends will compel Russia to real peace.”

Trump will meet first with Zelenskyy at 1.15pm EDT (6.15pm UK time) in the Oval Office, and then with the European leaders in the East Room at 3pm, the White House said.

Even before Trump’s remarks on Sunday, Zelenskyy faced a daunting task of reversing the damage done to Ukraine’s security prospects by the [Trump-Putin summit](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine)

The BBC published an article on August 18, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's statements regarding Ukraine and NATO, including a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House (<image:5619>, <image:5620>). The Guardian also published an article on August 18, 2025, discussing a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump, and European leaders in Washington, noting that Trump has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join NATO. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) published an article discussing a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy.

## Elaboration
The claim is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including The Guardian, VOA News, and Reuters, reported that Zelenskyy made the statement in a press conference on December 9, 2024. The evidence also shows that Zelenskyy met with Trump in the past.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy made the statement in a press conference on December 9, 2024, as reported by multiple news outlets. The search results provide direct quotes from Zelenskyy, supporting the claim's accuracy.

One of the most notable statements Nate Vance made was calling his cousin and Trump "_Vladimir Putin's useful idiots._" In an interview with _Le Figaro_, he argued that by halting or reducing support for Ukraine, his cousin and Trump were effectively doing Putin's bidding under the false hope of appeasing the Russian leader.

But now a member of his family has publicly criticised him: his cousin Nate has slammed the politician for his behaviour towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting at the White House.

Nate Vance, who fought on the front line of the Russo-Ukrainian war for three years, has said he finds it strange that his cousin never contacted him, despite knowing he had first-hand experience of developments in Ukraine.

Nate Vance has shot into the public eye after giving numerous interviews voicing his disapproval of his cousin’s treatment of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky during their infamous White House meeting. February’s televised encounter in the Oval Office saw Vance accuse Zelensky of campaigning for the Democrats and of being disrespectful and ungrateful towards the present US administration.

Speaking to The Independent, Nate said his cousin and Trump bullied Zelensky because they “can’t really push [\[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/entertainment/article/3288698/who-vladimir-putins-rumoured-secret-daughter-luiza-rozova-russian-president-reportedly-shares-paris?module=inline&pgtype=article)

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)

[Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has eschewed suits for military-style dress in what he says is solidarity with soldiers.

"Everyone knows that's why he does that and it's kind of a symbolic thing," Nate Vance said."

(Kyiv, October 30, 2024) – [Ukraine’s](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/ukraine)
 new [law](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3894-IX)
 banning religious organizations with ties to the [Russian](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia)
 Orthodox Church is overly broad and could have far-reaching consequences for Ukrainians’ right to religious freedom, Human Rights Watch said today. He noted that there are Ukrainian Orthodox Church congregations in occupied territories that “refuse to join the Russian Orthodox Churchfor many reasons.” He said that the ban would sever the connection with those churches, and that the “Russian Orthodox Church will put their own people in place and that will be the end of it.”

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented multiple incidents in which groups of people forcefully entered churches belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Сhurch, “[justifying their actions](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/ukraine/2024/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-dec-2023-29-feb-2024.pdf)
 with decisions from local authorities to register new religious communities of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine at the same address as existing Ukrainian Orthodox Churchcommunities.” In September, Ukraine [blocked](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/rozporyadzhennya-ncu-vid-12-09-2024-769-2574-pro-blokuvannya-domennikh-imen)
 the website of the outlet DialogTUT, which covered Ukrainian Orthodox Church activities.

Ukraine is obligated under Ukrainian and international law to guarantee religious freedom. The law does not impact the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities should address any security concerns related to the activities of religious bodies or personnel that threaten state security, whether by individuals or specific religious communities, rather than effectively banning entire religious communities based solely on presumed affiliations with the Russian Orthodox Church, Human Rights Watch said. 

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s security service has initiated criminal proceedings [against](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/get-vid-moskvi-k-radi-zbirayutsya-zaboroniti-1723413259.html)
 at least 100 clergymen, most affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on charges of “collaborationism,” treason, and“aiding the aggressor state.” 

Broad implementation of the new law risks severe practical consequences for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s congregations and millions of parishioners, Human Rights Watch said. It said it would develop regulations to implement the law within three months of its publication, to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 

The law considers any ties, not just institutional and organizational, but also canonical, with the Russian Orthodox Church to be grounds for banning it. 

Requiring the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to sever canonical ties may cast doubt on the legitimacy of its adherents’ religious beliefs, which the European Court of Human Rights has identified as a key element of the right to freedom of religion, Human Rights Watch said. “But the law interferes with the right to freedom of religion and is so broad that it could violate the rights of Ukrainian Orthodox Church members.”

The Ukrainian government should suspend implementation of the law and request the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe’s’ Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to provide expert analysis of the law that would be the basis for its rights-respecting revision, Human Rights Watch said.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church was [established](https://risu.ua/ukrajinska-pravoslavna-cerkva-moskovskogo-patriarhatu_n48337)
 in 1990 as an autonomous branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leadership supports Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Yet, in January 2023, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience found these steps insufficient, stating that the “status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as a structural subdivision of the Russian Orthodox Church... remains unchanged.”

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church exists alongside the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was [established](https://www.pomisna.info/uk/document-post/patriarshyj-i-synodalnyj-tomos-nadannya-avtokefalnogo-tserkovnogo-ustroyu-pravoslavnij-tserkvi-v-ukrayini/)
 in 2019 under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. They range from restrictions on ownership and operation of religious properties to difficulties in accessing places of worship and heightened risk of security service surveillance and prosecution.

Any prosecution or penalty not based on specific, unlawful actions but solely on the adherence to a peaceful practice of faith, constitutes religious discrimination and is prohibited by international human rights law. 

In a written response to questions Human Rights Watch sent on October 2, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience said that the law’s main objective is “to prevent the network of religious organizations officially registered in Ukraine from being used against Ukraine.” 

The agency said that Ukraine “does not demand that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church betray the doctrine of the Orthodox Church, change liturgical practices or language, switch to a different liturgical calendar, or join another church jurisdiction. The only requirement that the Law insists on is withdrawing from the Russian Orthodox Church, which is involved in the war against Ukraine.”

The agency also shared recommendations on measures that could be taken to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church."

Published on September 4, 2024

Ukraine has passed a law banning religious organizations with links to Russia. The formal ban is a major moment in a long-running dispute, and will have far-reaching consequences for Ukraine both at home and abroad.

When the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was established in 2018 under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, it was hoped that the UOCMP and the OCU would gradually merge. In any foreign country where there are Ukrainians, there should be our Ukrainian church.” She seems unaware that under canon law, the OCU cannot [open](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/01/can-the-ukrainian-orthodox-church-survive-the-war-with-russia?lang=en)
 parishes outside Ukraine.

Voting on the new law in Ukraine’s parliament revealed some committed opposition to the ban. It has also been criticized by the [Pope](https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/pope-francis-condemns-ukraine-s-ban-russian-orthodox-church)

One of the reasons Kyiv took so long to outlaw the UOCMP was for fear of a hostile reaction from conservatives in the United States. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, for example, [said](https://t.me/vereshchuk_iryna/2430)
 on August 20 that Ukraine should “stop the influence of the harmful Russian church on Ukrainians not only in Ukraine, but also outside its borders. The main target of the law is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOCMP), which was established in 1990 as a self-governing church under the canonical jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).

The Ukrainian government held back from taking such a step immediately after the full-scale invasion by Russia: after all, the UOCMP is the country’s biggest church. Instead, the continued presence of a religious organization formally affiliated with Moscow has angered patriotic Ukrainians and provoked the suspicion of the authorities.

UOCMP [efforts](https://news.church.ua/2022/05/27/postanova-soboru-ukrajinskoji-pravoslavnoji-cerkvi-vid-27-travnya-2022-roku/#2024-08-22)
 in recent years to show it is independent of Moscow have not convinced officials. As of May 2024, it had [10,587 parishes](https://data.gov.ua/dataset/3d0dc6d8-bc68-4796-a08c-70222258e566)
 in Ukraine compared to the OCU’s 8,075. Between February 2022 and May 2024, just [685 UOCMP parishes](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/skolko-cerkvey-upc-mp-deystvuet-v-ukraine-v-2024-godu-i-skolko-pereshlo-v-pcu-dannye-opendatabot-50415369.html)
 went over to the OCU—and they were mostly in the center and west of the country. The boxer Oleksandr Usyk, for example—one of Ukraine’s most popular sportspeople—is a vocal public [supporter](https://xsport.ua/ru/boxing_s/news/-usik-soobshchil-chto-prodolzhaet-khodit-v-upts-mp_8969480/)
 of the UOCMP.

The international context of the ban is also significant."

[Joe Rogan](https://globalnews.ca/tag/joe-rogan/)
 said he will not be attending an upcoming [UFC](https://globalnews.ca/tag/ufc/)
 fight in Montreal because he doesn’t “go to Canada anymore” and joked that he would “rather go to Russia.”

! He’s a sketchy guy,” Rogan said on the podcast.

Rogan also said Trudeau has “some shaky deals” and added that he would “like to see where the money is coming from.” It is still unclear what deals Rogan was referring to.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. “I rather go to Russia.”

Story continues below advertisement

Rogan claimed that Canadian authorities froze bank accounts of people who “only donated to the truckers” and that people are “still in jail” for their participation.

“It was kind of when a lot of people woke up,” Rogan added.

This isn’t the first time Rogan has criticized Canada on the podcast.

In March, Rogan [said he didn’t love Trump’s idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)
 of making Canada the 51st U.S. What comes next?](https://globalnews.ca/news/11320440/air-canada-flight-attendants-vote-strike-timeline/)

Back in July 2022, Rogan [had some strong words about Canada and Trudeau](https://globalnews.ca/news/8997721/joe-rogan-canada-communist-justin-trudeau-sketchy-dictator/)
, voicing his distaste for the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Canada’s communist,” Rogan said on the podcast. <image:2033>

The UFC commentator shared his thoughts on [his podcast, _The Joe Rogan Experience_](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xr-DqSmJEXI?si=Q3f-0swafwYpFl0G)
, when asked if he will be in attendance to watch UFC fighter Belal Muhammad defend his Welterweight gold against Jack Della Maddalena in May.

When Rogan asked his guests Gordon Ryan, Brendan Schaub and Eddie Bravo when the fight is set to take place, they said, “About two months.”

“Where’s that at?” Rogan asked.

_The Joe Rogan Experience_ producer Jamie Vernon told Rogan that the fight will be held in Montreal at UFC 315 on May 10.

“Wow, I won’t be there."

Content: "I’d rather go to Russia,” he said, laughing.

Earlier in the show, Rogan remarked that Canada’s government is “terrible” — but said “the Canadian people are awesome.” 

Rogan said in July that his beef with Canada initially began during the COVID-19 pandemic after thousands of protesting truckers [descended on the capital in Ottawa](https://nypost.com/2022/02/14/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergency-powers-to-quell-protests/)
 and railed against the country’s vaccine mandate, [according to Front Office Sports](https://frontofficesports.com/joe-rogan-canada-massive-ufc-315-event/)
.

President Trump, who Rogan helped throttle to a second term in the White House with an appearance on his podcast days before the 2024 election, has sparked tensions between the US and Canada for [imposing new tariffs](https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/world-news/canadian-pm-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-slams-trump-trade-war/)
 — and suggesting Canada become the 51st state.

The trade war has previously seeped into the sports world, with Canadian fans booing the US national anthem during the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament.

Rogan [admitted last month](https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/joe-rogan-doesnt-want-canada-to-be-us-51st-state/)
 that he does not think Canada should join the union, but wants the two countries to make up and end what he called “the dumbest f–king feud.”

 [!Rogan after a lightweight fight during the UFC 313 event at T-Mobile Arena on March 08, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. UFC commentator Joe Rogan said he won’t go to an upcoming fight because it’s in Canada — joking that he’d “rather go to Russia.”

Rogan gave the brush off on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” when asked about UFC 315 in May being in Montreal.

“Wow. I don’t go to Canada anymore,” he said, having previously spoken out against the Great White North’s spat with President Trump.

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

AOL News also debunked the claim, stating that it originated from a website known for spreading fake news and that there was no credible evidence to support it. Boatos.org also reported that it is false that Putin demanded the extradition of Fauci.

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.
> 
> — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) [August 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1819025395804717182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, **Stephen Capus**, has [said](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-prisoner-swap-belarus-gershkovich-whelan-alsu/33059280.html)
 that the broadcaster welcomed news of RFE/RL journalist **Alsu Kurmasheva**’s “imminent release and are grateful to the American government and all who worked tirelessly to end her unjust treatment by Russia.”

> Alsu’s release makes us even more determined to secure the freedom of three other RFE/RL journalists, cruelly imprisoned in Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea.

The return marks the conclusion of what Biden called a “brutal ordeal” for the three Americans and their families following their detentions in Russia, where prisoners are often kept in harrowing conditions.

Biden speaks after freed Americans arrive in US

Whelan, 54, had spent almost six years in Russian prisons after his arrest in Moscow in December 2018, while Gershkovich, 32, had been detained for more than a year. Both were sentenced on espionage charges and declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department.

Kurmasheva, a 47-year-old journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was detained in October 2023 and found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army – charges her family and employer deny.

Their release – and that of Washington Post contributor and permanent US resident Vladimir Kara-Murza, 42 – was orchestrated as part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations involving 24 detainees in total.

Sixteen people were released from Russian custody on Thursday, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners in their own country. Moscow in return got former high-ranking FSB colonel Vadim Krasikov, as well as several individuals accused of spying or cybercrime.

 and legacy-defining moment for Biden less than six months before he leaves office.

In a statement earlier Thursday, Biden hailed the agreement as a “feat of diplomacy,” in collaboration with US allies, including Germany, Poland, Norway, Turkey and Slovenia.

The [returnees](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/world/who-are-detainees-russia-us-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html)
 were greeted with tears and embraces by their joyous families at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were also on the tarmac to welcome them after their plane touched down some 20 minutes before midnight on Thursday.

Whelan, who was first to exit the plane, gave a salute before shaking hands with the US leaders, followed by Gershkovich, who embraced both Harris and Biden before hugging his ecstatic parents. Today, their agony is over,” said Biden, who hosted the families of Gershkovich, Whelan, Kurmasheva and Kara-Murza at the White House.

Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva flew roughly 10 hours from Ankara, Turkey, on top of a three-hour-and-45-minute flight from Moscow to Ankara.

They were accompanied on their return plane by multiple medics, a psychologist and US government officials including representatives from the National Security Council and State Department, a US official told CNN.

A little less than two hours after touching down at Joint Base Andrews, the three Americans and some of their family members continued on to San Antonio where they landed early Friday morning. “I’m never going back there again,” Whelan joked, referring to Russa.

The three Americans will be taken to Brooke Army Medical Center to undergo medical evaluation and receive whatever care they need for as long as they need, the US official said.

This is typical protocol for wrongfully detained Americans who return home. Kurmasheva rushed into the arms of her husband and daughters after greeting Harris and Biden.

Gershkovich went quickly to address media gathered at the tarmac, telling his Wall Street Journal colleagues the words they had been waiting more than a year to hear. WNBA player Brittney Griner also went to the center right after she was released from Russian detention in December 2022.

The returnees will also participate in a Defense Department program called PISA (Post Isolation Support Activities), which is meant to help them readjust to being back in the United States. Many recently freed US wrongful detainees have undergone this program to help them acclimate back to normal life.

_This story has been updated with additional developments._

CNN’s MJ Lee, Sam Waldenberg, Betsy Klein, Paul P. “I’m home,” he said.

Biden observed the emotional family reunions, then removed his pin and placed it on Whelan’s lapel as Harris looked on.

“It feels wonderful."

    Rezaian, an Iranian-American journalist, was formerly the Tehran bureau chief for The Washington Post. “I feel like we’ve been kind of collectively stabbed in the back.”
    
    Earlier, she told US public broadcaster PBS that she had spoken to her brother the day before the swap, and had kept hoping that he may be included in the deal at the last minute.

    She went on to attack the Biden administration for not prioritising her brother's release.
    
    "We don't have the WNBA behind us and we don't have The Wall Street Journal behind us," she said, referring to other prisoners freed from Russia.

    *   Former US marine **Paul Whelan**, and reporters **Evan Gershkovich** and **Alsu Kurmasheva** were greeted by US President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris at Joint Airbase Andrews
    *   Their families, which had also gathered at the **air base near Washington DC**, welcomed them with hugs and tears. He was accused of planting explosives by a train line, on behalf of Ukrainian intelligence.
    
    Teenager Kevin Lik has also been freed, a dual national accused of taking photos of military sites in Russia.
    
    Germany has paid a hefty price for this deal, handing over a Russian FSB assassin who killed a former Chechen fighter in central Berlin. In the end, he said, the swap was also about protecting German citizens, about solidarity with the US – and about standing up for those Russians who had stood up for democracy and freedom and been punished for that.

On a muggy evening at Andrews air force base near Washington DC, Gershkovich and the other freed prisoners, the ex-marine Paul Whelan and the journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, touched down on US soil and shortly later disembarked a Bombardier jet from Turkey. On the day of his death, Sullivan said, he met Gershkovich’s mother and said he still saw a path forward for the deal.

    ! It was also a victory for our country”.

He added: “This was the United States of America at our best, working with our allies to bring home our people.” He also hailed the release of other prisoners who had stood up to the Russian regime as “freedom fighters”.

Sullivan said the deal was clinched because of Joe Biden’s international relationships, with the US president’s ties “unlocking the deal” that the US and European allies struck with Russia.

“It would not have happened without him,” he said.

He denied that such deals encourage hostile regimes to kidnap or imprison more innocent Americans, saying that during the Biden administration about 70 Americans held overseas had been released and there had not been a matching surge in those detained.

Hundreds of journalists came to the base to catch their first glimpse of the freed detainees who, combined, had spent nearly a decade in Russian captivity. Those returning to Russia included [a number of undercover spies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/whos-who-in-the-prisoner-exchange-between-russia-and-the-west)
 and a convicted FSB assassin whom Vladimir Putin had obsessively sought to free from German prison for years.

Kurmasheva, a Radio Free Europe journalist who was arrested on charges of failing to register herself as a foreign agent and then charged with spreading false information about the Russian military, had been sentenced to more than six years in prison.

The Russian opposition politician Ilya Yashin and several other opposition figures were also freed, including the British-Russian politician Vladimir Kara-Murza and three people who had worked as regional coordinators for the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison earlier this year.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.


# Your Judgement

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Times of India article from August 3, 2024, Joe Biden boarded the plane after the return of American prisoners from Russia and remained on the plane for about two minutes. The White House deputy press secretary said that Biden wanted to thank the flight crew. ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms)) <image:1>

Yahoo News reported on August 1, 2024, that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html)) <image:672> The Guardian reported on August 1, 2024, that Biden and Harris greeted the freed Americans upon their arrival in the US.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On August 2, 2024, CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-russia-prisoner-swap-landing-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/02/biden-harris-greet-us-america-russia-prisoner-exchange)) reported on the return of three freed Americans after a prisoner swap with Russia. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris greeted the returnees at Joint Base Andrews. The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ck7gwe808yet)) also reported on the event.

The articles mention that the families of the freed Americans were present. The Guardian article includes a photograph of Biden and Harris greeting the freed Americans (<image:5704>).


### Evidence from `image_search`

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

From [Source](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-arrive-for-santa-ynez-valley-vacation/): 
Content: "A motorcade took the Bidens to Santa Ynez, with a sheriff’s Air Support Unit helicopter hovering above, [KEYT reported](https://keyt.com/news/santa-barbara-s-county/2024/08/20/president-joe-biden-first-lady-arrive-in-santa-barbara/)
.

A steady stream of locals headed to the airport on Tuesday morning to take photos of Air Force One — a C-32A aircraft — through the security fence.

The C-32A — the military version of the Boeing 757 — regularly serves as Air Force Two when used by the first lady, the vice president and other high-ranking officials.

But it can be pressed into service as Air Force One for flights to destinations such as Santa Barbara that cannot accommodate the larger and more familiar VC-25 aircraft, which is derived from the Boeing 747.

The president is in town.

Early Tuesday morning, Air Force One delivered President Joe Biden and his family to the Santa Barbara Airport on the way to their [Santa Ynez Valley vacation](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-may-be-headed-to-santa-ynez-valley-to-vacation-this-week/)
.

Biden’s speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago ran late, and the plane arrived around 2:20 a.m. <image:738>

President Joe Biden’s plane arrived at Santa Barbara Airport early Tuesday morning. “I’m hoping to bring the grandkids by later today.”

Lupe Leyva said he came to see the plane and take a picture with it.

Asked how he heard about Biden’s visit, Leyva joked, “Oh, he texted me.”

Biden’s Vacation in Santa Ynez Valley
-------------------------------------

In comments to media Monday en route to Chicago, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre revealed the president’s vacation plan included spending time with his family. 

“I think that’s important for any families to do.  Presidents are never on vacation.  He’s a president wherever he is,” she said.

“He’s certainly going to continue to be doing the work, going to be very much focused and getting updates,” Jean-Pierre said, adding those updates include the situation in the Middle East plus other foreign and domestic issues.

The Bidens are expected to stay in the Santa Ynez Valley for the rest of the week.

The [Federal Aviation Administration](http://www.faa.gov/)
 issued temporary flight restrictions for Tuesday through Sunday around the Santa Ynez Airport.

Multiple military aircraft also have attracted attention while flying and landing around the Santa Ynez and Santa Maria airports last week.

[As Noozhawk previously reported](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-may-be-headed-to-santa-ynez-valley-to-vacation-this-week/)
, the vacation follows Biden’s DNC speech making the case for Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Once expected to accept the Democratic nomination for president, Biden stepped aside in July, saying he believed it would be “in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down.”

The timing of a vacation some 2,000 miles from the convention and in a sleepy community likely helps avoid Biden inadvertently upstaging Harris and Walz as the party moves to a new generation. 

The White House confirmed the Bidens were staying at the Santa Ynez Valley ranch of billionaire Joe Kiani, a family friend and a big political donor. He and Jill Biden briefly [met with a group of teachers](https://www.noozhawk.com/santa_barbara_teachers_meet_with_bidens_tour_air_force_2_20140321/)
 and gave them a tour of Air Force Two.

[! When I heard about this, I said, 'I'm going to come by on my lunch break,'" said Santa Barbara resident Beth Hassenplug who came with her mom.

At the same time, information began circulating that the 747 Air Force plane that normally serves as Air Force One was in the airspace above Lompoc presumably coming to Vandenberg Space Force Base.

Wayne Wilcox of Santa Barbara saw the Boeing 757 but wanted to see the larger plane. "I'd rather see the 747 that would be the most iconic, that is what I was expecting to see actually."

For those following the air traffic controllers upon arrival, "whenever I hear them  say 'Air Force One you are cleared to land', it's just just an awesome thing to hear," said Carpinteria resident Mark Dotter who came to the location like others for a close-up.

With logistics always ready to change at a moments notice, it is unclear what the exact transportation plans will be when the President and family members leave this weekend.

Around the Santa Ynez Valley, First Lady Jill Biden was seen shopping at a bookstore, a general store, and a candy store today.

Heavy Secret Service and California Highway Patrol presence is in the area.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Times of India article from August 3, 2024, Joe Biden boarded the plane after the return of American prisoners from Russia and remained on the plane for about two minutes. The White House deputy press secretary said that Biden wanted to thank the flight crew. ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms)) <image:1>

Yahoo News reported on August 1, 2024, that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html)) <image:672> The Guardian reported on August 1, 2024, that Biden and Harris greeted the freed Americans upon their arrival in the US.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On August 2, 2024, CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-russia-prisoner-swap-landing-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/02/biden-harris-greet-us-america-russia-prisoner-exchange)) reported on the return of three freed Americans after a prisoner swap with Russia. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris greeted the returnees at Joint Base Andrews. The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ck7gwe808yet)) also reported on the event.

The articles mention that the families of the freed Americans were present. The Guardian article includes a photograph of Biden and Harris greeting the freed Americans (<image:5704>).

The Hill ([https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-u-s-news/ap-biden-takes-inaugural-flight-in-long-delayed-new-marine-one-helicopter/](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-u-s-news/ap-biden-takes-inaugural-flight-in-long-delayed-new-marine-one-helicopter/)) and the Sun Sentinel ([https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/08/19/biden-takes-inaugural-flight-in-long-delayed-new-marine-one-helicopter/](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/08/19/biden-takes-inaugural-flight-in-long-delayed-new-marine-one-helicopter/)) both published articles about Joe Biden's inaugural flight in a new Marine One helicopter in August 2024. <image:5730> <image:5731>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect remains unverified.


# Your Judgement

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned. However, the evidence does not explicitly state the plane was empty. Therefore, the claim's veracity regarding the "empty plane" aspect is not fully verified. `not enough information`

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether the plane was empty when he boarded. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect remains unverified.

Air Force One is one of the most recognisable planes in the world – and you’ve likely seen more of it as US president Joe Biden hops on and off while campaigning for the upcoming presidential [election](https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/trump-biden-election-updates-live/news-story/cab7696d26cffedcd23e96161a968876)

Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary stepping off Air Force One after arriving at Sydney Airport for the start of his then Aussie tour in 1996.

But while it’s one of the most famous planes in the world, boasting the iconic Kennedy-era blue-and-white design, what’s often not known is what’s on the interior.

Most footage and photos we see are of presidents climbing the stairs, getting to the top and looking back as they give a wave before heading inside.

But what awaits them inside is basically a mobile White House in the sky.

As they step foot inside, in this case, Mr Biden, he’s greeted with his very own extensive suite that features a large office, lavatory and conference room.

The White House has mainly brushed aside questions about the change and won't say much about it, other than there are a series of factors that go into whether he uses the short or tall stairs, including security, weather and the availability of rolling staircases.

When Biden lands at an airport where officials roll out the red carpet to welcome him, he still uses the tall stairs.

President Biden boards Air Force One at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo. on June 1, 2023, after attending the 2023 United States Air Force Academy Graduation Ceremony.

It's one of the iconic images of the American presidency: the commander in chief, standing and waving to the cameras from the top of the stairs leading into Air Force One.

But recently, President Biden has been avoiding climbing up the sometimes-wobbly 18-foot staircase that is trucked over to the plane's upper door. The short stairs have the distinct advantage of moving most of Biden's ascent into Air Force One out of public view. **Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP** ****hide caption****

According to the Times of India, Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms)) <image:1>. Yahoo News reported that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html)). The Noozhawk article mentions that Biden arrived at the Santa Barbara Airport on Air Force One for a vacation ([https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-arrive-for-santa-ynez-valley-vacation/](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-arrive-for-santa-ynez-valley-vacation/)) <image:738>, <image:740>, <image:741>. The KEYT article discusses Air Force One's presence at the Santa Barbara Airport ([https://keyt.com/news/local-news/2024/08/21/air-force-one-plane-gets-the-spotlight-while-president-biden-vacations-in-santa-barbara-county/](https://keyt.com/news/local-news/2024/08/21/air-force-one-plane-gets-the-spotlight-while-president-biden-vacations-in-santa-barbara-county/)) <image:745>, <image:746>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether the plane was empty when he boarded. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect remains unverified.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is confirmed that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. `false`

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 Eventually, the [Ukrainian Defence Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Ukraine) "Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)")
 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)
[\[b\]](#cite_note-"memory1-15)

According to the [Armed Forces of Ukraine](/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine "Armed Forces of Ukraine")
, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that with the current way of fighting, it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. The article also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war. The article also states that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured as of January 2025, while Donald Trump estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed in January 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While the Wikipedia article mentions estimates that approach this number, they are for earlier dates (July 2024) and include casualties, not just losses. The other sources provide different figures for different timeframes, making it difficult to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses, including the definition of "loss" (killed, wounded, missing, captured), and the exact timeframe (February 2025) would be needed.

The evidence provides conflicting estimates of Russian troop losses in the Ukraine war. Some sources estimate casualties (killed and wounded) nearing the claimed number, but for earlier dates. Other sources provide different figures for different timeframes.

The claim cannot be verified due to conflicting information and a lack of specific data on troop losses for February 2025. `not enough information`

Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. This statistical method, created in collaboration with _Meduza_, helps to account for the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

About our reports
-----------------

This publication is divided into two parts:

**Bi-weekly Summary.** A text summary, updated every two weeks, in which we report on what we have learned about recent losses and the frontline events that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part provides visualisations of the losses since the start of the war, showing, for example, where the dead served or which regions they came from. We update the data for these graphics, while the accompanying text is refreshed but remains largely the same.

A detailed description of our method for estimating total deaths using Probate Registry data can be [found at this link](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k-trl)
.

**Last update to the named list:** August 29, 2025.

**Last update to the Probate Registry estimate:** August 29, 2025; estimate as of August 2025

Full named list of verified losses is available here: [**200.zona.media**](https://200.zona.media)

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. These are absolute figures and have not been adjusted for population or number of military units.

You can filter the map to show total losses, losses by branch of service, or the home regions of mobilised soldiers who were killed.

In most cases, official reports or visual cues like uniforms and insignia allow us to determine a soldier’s branch of service, or how he came to be in the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.).

The chart below compares these different groups of servicemen.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. In our next analysis, we will also be able to investigate the mortality peak of late 2024 in greater depth.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

The map below shows the distribution of casualties across Russia’s regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior officer in the General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/04/25/balashikha)
 by a car bomb in a Moscow suburb in April 2025.

Two deputy army commanders, Major General [Andrei Sukhovetsky](https://admnvrsk.ru/o-gorode/novosti/glavnye-novosti/news-03032022200708-105771/)
 (41st Army) and Major General [Vladimir Frolov](https://www.fontanka.ru/2022/04/16/71262053/)
 (8th Army), were killed in the first weeks of the war. In November 2023, Major General Vladimir Zavadsky, deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2023/12/04/zavadsky)
 near the village of Krynky.

In November 2024, Major General Pavel Klimenko, commander of the 5th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade (formerly the “Oplot” Brigade of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic), [was fatally wounded](https://zona.media/news/2024/11/07/klimenko)
 by an FPV drone.

In July 2025, a strike on the headquarters of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade [killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/07/11/155)
 at least six officers, including the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, Mikhail Gudkov.

The two retired generals on the list are Kanamat Botashev, a pilot who had been dismissed for crashing a fighter jet and was fighting for _Wagner_ _PMC_ when his Su-25 [was shot down](https://zona.media/news/2022/05/31/su27)
 in May 2022, and Andrei Golovatsky, a former Interior Ministry general [serving](https://zona.media/news/2019/02/22/army)
 an 8.5-year prison sentence who was killed in June 2024.

The date of death is known in **98,340** cases."

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate on February 24, 2025, as of December 2024. [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl)


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured as of January 2025, while Donald Trump estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed in January 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While the Wikipedia article mentions estimates that approach this number, they are for earlier dates (July 2024) and include casualties, not just losses. The other sources provide different figures for different timeframes, making it difficult to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses, including the definition of "loss" (killed, wounded, missing, captured), and the exact timeframe (February 2025) would be needed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence from Mediazona, updated on August 29, 2025, estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed in the war by August 2025. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025.

The evidence does not support the claim. The provided figures are for a later date (August 2025) and refer only to deaths, not total losses.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial search revealed conflicting information and estimates for Russian casualties, but none that specifically supported the claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. The additional search provided an estimate of 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025, which is significantly lower and doesn't align with the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the available evidence, including the most recent data, does not support the figure of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. The evidence provides significantly lower figures and different metrics (deaths vs. losses). `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war by February 2025 is demonstrably false. While estimates of casualties exist, such as the British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)), these figures do not align with the claim's timeframe or definition of "losses." Furthermore, a Mediazona article from August 29, 2025, estimates around 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Mediazona](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), which is significantly lower than the claimed figure.
