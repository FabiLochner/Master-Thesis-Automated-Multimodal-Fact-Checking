Content: The article from Truthmeter.mk, published on November 4, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Volodymyr Zelensky bought Hitler's Mercedes-Benz 770 for $15 million.

The article provides evidence that the image is a montage and that the car was auctioned in Arizona, USA, in 2018. The article also mentions that the claim has been debunked by multiple sources. <image:4>, <image:167>.

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Hitler's parade car which was bought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 15 Million US-$.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.

The image used in the claim was associated with a car auctioned in Arizona in 2018.
