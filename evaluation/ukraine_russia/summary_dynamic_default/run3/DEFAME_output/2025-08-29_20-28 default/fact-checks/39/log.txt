Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436): 
Content: The article from Latin Times discusses the death of Infowars reporter Jamie White in Austin, Texas. It mentions that White believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list due to his work at Infowars. Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, also alleged that White was on a Ukrainian hit list. The Austin police stated that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of his apartment complex. <image:5696>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/): 
Content: The search result from StopFake.org states that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was murdered in Austin on March 9, and his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The article claims that there is no evidence that White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine" and that the screenshot of the alleged "list" does not match the actual appearance of the Myrotvorets website. <image:5721> The journalist's sister and law enforcement officials do not believe White was deliberately targeted.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418): 
Content: Newsweek reports that Alex Jones claimed that Jamie White, an Infowars colleague, was on a Ukrainian "hit list." The Austin Police Department stated that White was shot and killed in his apartment's parking lot on March 9, likely due to a car robbery. Jones stated that White was on a Ukrainian "hit list" for investigating USAID and George Soros. <image:5729> The article was written by Sophie Clark and published by Newsweek.

The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list after being shot dead is not supported by evidence. While the InfoWars reporter was shot dead in Austin, Texas, and Alex Jones made the claim, there is no evidence to support it, and the Austin Police Department suggested the murder was related to a car robbery, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418).
