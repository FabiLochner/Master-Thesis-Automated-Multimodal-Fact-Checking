## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL article from January 8, 2025, fact-checks an image of a Russian passport claimed to belong to Bashar al-Assad and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The article also mentions that Logically Facts debunked the claim. (![image 2651](media/2025-08-07_20-52-1754599946-890665.jpg)) The Wikipedia article discusses the Syrian civil war, including the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and the fall of the Assad regime. It mentions Bashar al-Assad's birthdate (September 11, 1965) and that he fled to Moscow and was granted political asylum in November 2024. (![image 21](media/69.jpg))

NV.ua discusses the arrest of Bashar al-Assad's relatives at Beirut's airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports. It also mentions that Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed and he fled to Moscow. (![image 2674](media/2025-08-07_20-58-1754600338-410139.jpg))


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article on Syrian passports ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_passport)), an image of Syrian passports from Alestiklal.net (![image 5945](media/2025-08-29_20-42-1756500168-576221.jpg)), and an image of a Libyan diplomatic passport from Libya Observer (![image 5946](media/2025-08-29_20-42-1756500169-356170.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image of the Russian passport is fake. An AOL article explicitly states that the image is photoshopped. Additionally, the evidence mentions that Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow and was granted political asylum. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the passport in the image.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows an authentic Russian passport of Bashar al-Assad is false. Multiple sources, including an AOL article, debunk the image as photoshopped.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. An AOL article ([https://www.aol.com/](https://www.aol.com/)) explicitly states that the image of the Russian passport is photoshopped.
