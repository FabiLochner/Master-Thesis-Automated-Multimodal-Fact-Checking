## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported on April 16, 2025, about the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, who claimed they were acting as individuals inspired by social media recruitment videos. The Guardian reported on Chinese troops marching with Russian forces in Moscow's Red Square for Victory Day.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report in 2023 on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mentioning the involvement of 58 National Societies, including the Red Cross Society of China and the Russian Red Cross Society. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society is at the forefront of the response in Ukraine.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article about Russia and China launching large-scale military drills. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/russia-and-china-launch-large-scale-military-drills-amid-tensions-with-us)) ![image 3189](media/2025-08-22_10-52-1755859947-387013.jpg)

USNI News published an article about China and Russia, including an image of Chinese troops. ([https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan](https://news.usni.org/2021/04/14/cno-gilday-china-russia-deliberately-testing-allies-cohesion-in-actions-in-ukraine-near-taiwan)) ![image 3190](media/2025-08-22_10-52-1755859947-910403.jpg) Al Jazeera published an article on March 25, 2023, with an image of Chinese soldiers. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/25/biden-says-no-sign-yet-of-china-sending-weapons-to-russia)) ![image 3191](media/2025-08-22_10-52-1755859948-307768.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Chinese troops have been involved in activities related to Russia, including military drills and participation in Victory Day parades. The Red Cross Society of China is also involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim appears on Wikipedia's "Airliner" page, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's article on the evolution of commercial airliners, and Merriam-Webster's definition of "airliner" (![image 6](media/8.jpg)). The Merriam-Webster entry was last updated on August 13, 2025.


## Elaboration
The reverse image search reveals that the image in the claim is associated with the term "airliner" and appears on Wikipedia, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and Merriam-Webster. This suggests that the image is of an airliner and not necessarily related to the Chinese Red Cross troops. The evidence does not support the claim that the image depicts Chinese Red Cross troops.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image used in the claim is of an airliner and not related to the Chinese Red Cross troops. The claim is therefore misleading.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there is evidence of Chinese involvement in activities related to Russia, including military drills and the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the image used in the claim is of an airliner and not related to Chinese Red Cross troops. The reverse image search results show the image is associated with the term "airliner" and appears on Wikipedia, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and Merriam-Webster.
