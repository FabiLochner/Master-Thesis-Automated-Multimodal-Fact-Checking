## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect remains unverified. To fully verify the claim, information about the presence of passengers or crew members on the plane when Biden boarded is needed.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is confirmed that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Joe Biden boarded an empty plane in August 2024 after the return of freed Americans is **partially supported**. Evidence confirms that Biden boarded a plane after the event, as reported by the Times of India and Yahoo News ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms), [https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html)). However, the evidence does not confirm the plane was empty when he boarded.
