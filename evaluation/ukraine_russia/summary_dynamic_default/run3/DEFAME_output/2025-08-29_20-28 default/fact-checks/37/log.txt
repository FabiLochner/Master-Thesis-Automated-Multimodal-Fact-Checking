The claim 'In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Joe Biden boarded an empty plane in August 2024 after the return of freed Americans is **partially supported**. Evidence confirms that Biden boarded a plane after the event, as reported by the Times of India and Yahoo News ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms), [https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-biden-did-000500209.html)). However, the evidence does not confirm the plane was empty when he boarded.

So, the overall veracity is: false
