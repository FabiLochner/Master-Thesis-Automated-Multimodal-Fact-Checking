[Joe Rogan](https://globalnews.ca/tag/joe-rogan/)
 said he will not be attending an upcoming [UFC](https://globalnews.ca/tag/ufc/)
 fight in Montreal because he doesn’t “go to Canada anymore” and joked that he would “rather go to Russia.”

! He’s a sketchy guy,” Rogan said on the podcast.

Rogan also said Trudeau has “some shaky deals” and added that he would “like to see where the money is coming from.” It is still unclear what deals Rogan was referring to.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. “I rather go to Russia.”

Rogan claimed that Canadian authorities froze bank accounts of people who “only donated to the truckers” and that people are “still in jail” for their participation.

“It was kind of when a lot of people woke up,” Rogan added.

This isn’t the first time Rogan has criticized Canada on the podcast.

In March, Rogan [said he didn’t love Trump’s idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)
 of making Canada the 51st U.S. What comes next?](https://globalnews.ca/news/11320440/air-canada-flight-attendants-vote-strike-timeline/)

Back in July 2022, Rogan [had some strong words about Canada and Trudeau](https://globalnews.ca/news/8997721/joe-rogan-canada-communist-justin-trudeau-sketchy-dictator/)
, voicing his distaste for the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Canada’s communist,” Rogan said on the podcast. <image:2033>

The UFC commentator shared his thoughts on [his podcast, _The Joe Rogan Experience_](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xr-DqSmJEXI?si=Q3f-0swafwYpFl0G)
, when asked if he will be in attendance to watch UFC fighter Belal Muhammad defend his Welterweight gold against Jack Della Maddalena in May.

When Rogan asked his guests Gordon Ryan, Brendan Schaub and Eddie Bravo when the fight is set to take place, they said, “About two months.”

“Where’s that at?” Rogan asked.

_The Joe Rogan Experience_ producer Jamie Vernon told Rogan that the fight will be held in Montreal at UFC 315 on May 10.

“Wow, I won’t be there."

Content: "I’d rather go to Russia,” he said, laughing.

Earlier in the show, Rogan remarked that Canada’s government is “terrible” — but said “the Canadian people are awesome.” 

Rogan said in July that his beef with Canada initially began during the COVID-19 pandemic after thousands of protesting truckers [descended on the capital in Ottawa](https://nypost.com/2022/02/14/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergency-powers-to-quell-protests/)
 and railed against the country’s vaccine mandate, [according to Front Office Sports](https://frontofficesports.com/joe-rogan-canada-massive-ufc-315-event/)
.

President Trump, who Rogan helped throttle to a second term in the White House with an appearance on his podcast days before the 2024 election, has sparked tensions between the US and Canada for [imposing new tariffs](https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/world-news/canadian-pm-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-slams-trump-trade-war/)
 — and suggesting Canada become the 51st state.

The trade war has previously seeped into the sports world, with Canadian fans booing the US national anthem during the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament.

Rogan [admitted last month](https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/joe-rogan-doesnt-want-canada-to-be-us-51st-state/)
 that he does not think Canada should join the union, but wants the two countries to make up and end what he called “the dumbest f–king feud.”

 [!Rogan after a lightweight fight during the UFC 313 event at T-Mobile Arena on March 08, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. UFC commentator Joe Rogan said he won’t go to an upcoming fight because it’s in Canada — joking that he’d “rather go to Russia.”

Rogan gave the brush off on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” when asked about UFC 315 in May being in Montreal.

“Wow. I don’t go to Canada anymore,” he said, having previously spoken out against the Great White North’s spat with President Trump.

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.

Biden speaks after freed Americans arrive in US

Whelan, 54, had spent almost six years in Russian prisons after his arrest in Moscow in December 2018, while Gershkovich, 32, had been detained for more than a year. Both were sentenced on espionage charges and declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department.

Kurmasheva, a 47-year-old journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was detained in October 2023 and found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army – charges her family and employer deny.

Their release – and that of Washington Post contributor and permanent US resident Vladimir Kara-Murza, 42 – was orchestrated as part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations involving 24 detainees in total.

Sixteen people were released from Russian custody on Thursday, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners in their own country. Moscow in return got former high-ranking FSB colonel Vadim Krasikov, as well as several individuals accused of spying or cybercrime.

The [returnees](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/world/who-are-detainees-russia-us-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html)
 were greeted with tears and embraces by their joyous families at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were also on the tarmac to welcome them after their plane touched down some 20 minutes before midnight on Thursday.

Whelan, who was first to exit the plane, gave a salute before shaking hands with the US leaders, followed by Gershkovich, who embraced both Harris and Biden before hugging his ecstatic parents. Today, their agony is over,” said Biden, who hosted the families of Gershkovich, Whelan, Kurmasheva and Kara-Murza at the White House.

Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva flew roughly 10 hours from Ankara, Turkey, on top of a three-hour-and-45-minute flight from Moscow to Ankara.

They were accompanied on their return plane by multiple medics, a psychologist and US government officials including representatives from the National Security Council and State Department, a US official told CNN.

A little less than two hours after touching down at Joint Base Andrews, the three Americans and some of their family members continued on to San Antonio where they landed early Friday morning. “I’m never going back there again,” Whelan joked, referring to Russa.

The three Americans will be taken to Brooke Army Medical Center to undergo medical evaluation and receive whatever care they need for as long as they need, the US official said.

This is typical protocol for wrongfully detained Americans who return home. Kurmasheva rushed into the arms of her husband and daughters after greeting Harris and Biden.

Gershkovich went quickly to address media gathered at the tarmac, telling his Wall Street Journal colleagues the words they had been waiting more than a year to hear. WNBA player Brittney Griner also went to the center right after she was released from Russian detention in December 2022.

The returnees will also participate in a Defense Department program called PISA (Post Isolation Support Activities), which is meant to help them readjust to being back in the United States. Many recently freed US wrongful detainees have undergone this program to help them acclimate back to normal life.

_This story has been updated with additional developments._

CNN’s MJ Lee, Sam Waldenberg, Betsy Klein, Paul P. “I’m home,” he said.

Biden observed the emotional family reunions, then removed his pin and placed it on Whelan’s lapel as Harris looked on.

“It feels wonderful."

    Watch: Biden, Harris and families greet freed prisoners on return to the US
    
    As the three American prisoners stepped back onto US soil, it marked the end of their ordeal in Russia and the defining moment of the biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War.
    
    Evan Gershkovich had spent almost 500 days in a Russian prison, Paul Whelan five years and all three were visibly elated to return to their families.
    
    Waiting to greet them on the tarmac at Joint Airbase Andrews were President Biden and Vice-President Harris.
    
    Both stand to gain politically from having achieved this most complex of diplomatic negotiations. Summary

*   Three US citizens freed in a Russian-West prisoner swap are back on American soil after [landing in Maryland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/ck7gwe808yet?post=asset%3A915e0f2f-b245-41e8-ae9f-ee9b6c14a43e#post)

*   Biden thanks his allies who he said made the "toughest call" to release the prisoners
    
*   The deal frees 24 detainees from seven countries. The Americans involved in the prisoner swap have "a lot to navigate" as they return to the US, says Jason Rezaian, who was imprisoned in Iran for 544 days.
    
    Rezaian, an Iranian-American journalist, was formerly the Tehran bureau chief for The Washington Post. “I feel like we’ve been kind of collectively stabbed in the back.”
    
    Earlier, she told US public broadcaster PBS that she had spoken to her brother the day before the swap, and had kept hoping that he may be included in the deal at the last minute.
    
    "It was just really hard to let it go," she said.
    
    She went on to attack the Biden administration for not prioritising her brother's release.
    
    "We don't have the WNBA behind us and we don't have The Wall Street Journal behind us," she said, referring to other prisoners freed from Russia.
    
    "So it's been very difficult for us to get our man out," she said.

1. As we bring this page to a close, here's a wrap of developments:
    
    *   Former US marine **Paul Whelan**, and reporters **Evan Gershkovich** and **Alsu Kurmasheva** were greeted by US President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris at Joint Airbase Andrews
    *   Their families, which had also gathered at the **air base near Washington DC**, welcomed them with hugs and tears. He was accused of planting explosives by a train line, on behalf of Ukrainian intelligence.
    
    Teenager Kevin Lik has also been freed, a dual national accused of taking photos of military sites in Russia.
    
    Germany has paid a hefty price for this deal, handing over a Russian FSB assassin who killed a former Chechen fighter in central Berlin. In the end, he said, the swap was also about protecting German citizens, about solidarity with the US – and about standing up for those Russians who had stood up for democracy and freedom and been punished for that.

    “No word is strong enough for this," Kara-Murza says.
    
    "I was sure I’m going to die in prison because I don’t believe what’s happening," he adds, saying: "I still think I’m sleeping in my prison cell in Omsk instead of hearing your voice."
    
    He tells Biden "you’ve done a wonderful thing by saving so many people".

On a muggy evening at Andrews air force base near Washington DC, Gershkovich and the other freed prisoners, the ex-marine Paul Whelan and the journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, touched down on US soil and shortly later disembarked a Bombardier jet from Turkey. On the day of his death, Sullivan said, he met Gershkovich’s mother and said he still saw a path forward for the deal.

    ! It was also a victory for our country”.

He added: “This was the United States of America at our best, working with our allies to bring home our people.” He also hailed the release of other prisoners who had stood up to the Russian regime as “freedom fighters”.

Sullivan said the deal was clinched because of Joe Biden’s international relationships, with the US president’s ties “unlocking the deal” that the US and European allies struck with Russia.

“It would not have happened without him,” he said.

He denied that such deals encourage hostile regimes to kidnap or imprison more innocent Americans, saying that during the Biden administration about 70 Americans held overseas had been released and there had not been a matching surge in those detained.

Hundreds of journalists came to the base to catch their first glimpse of the freed detainees who, combined, had spent nearly a decade in Russian captivity. Those returning to Russia included [a number of undercover spies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/whos-who-in-the-prisoner-exchange-between-russia-and-the-west)
 and a convicted FSB assassin whom Vladimir Putin had obsessively sought to free from German prison for years.

Kurmasheva, a Radio Free Europe journalist who was arrested on charges of failing to register herself as a foreign agent and then charged with spreading false information about the Russian military, had been sentenced to more than six years in prison.

The Russian opposition politician Ilya Yashin and several other opposition figures were also freed, including the British-Russian politician Vladimir Kara-Murza and three people who had worked as regional coordinators for the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison earlier this year.

The complex deal had [involved months of negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/evan-gershkovich-russian-prison-freed)
 between multiple countries and came together in extreme secrecy, with the location and exact makeup of the exchange not made public until the last moment. <image:5714>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

.

A steady stream of locals headed to the airport on Tuesday morning to take photos of Air Force One — a C-32A aircraft — through the security fence.

The C-32A — the military version of the Boeing 757 — regularly serves as Air Force Two when used by the first lady, the vice president and other high-ranking officials.

But it can be pressed into service as Air Force One for flights to destinations such as Santa Barbara that cannot accommodate the larger and more familiar VC-25 aircraft, which is derived from the Boeing 747.

The president is in town.

Early Tuesday morning, Air Force One delivered President Joe Biden and his family to the Santa Barbara Airport on the way to their [Santa Ynez Valley vacation](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-may-be-headed-to-santa-ynez-valley-to-vacation-this-week/)
.

Biden’s speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago ran late, and the plane arrived around 2:20 a.m. <image:738>

President Joe Biden’s plane arrived at Santa Barbara Airport early Tuesday morning. “I’m hoping to bring the grandkids by later today.”

Lupe Leyva said he came to see the plane and take a picture with it.

Asked how he heard about Biden’s visit, Leyva joked, “Oh, he texted me.”

Biden’s Vacation in Santa Ynez Valley
-------------------------------------

In comments to media Monday en route to Chicago, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre revealed the president’s vacation plan included spending time with his family. 

“I think that’s important for any families to do.  Presidents are never on vacation.  He’s a president wherever he is,” she said.

“He’s certainly going to continue to be doing the work, going to be very much focused and getting updates,” Jean-Pierre said, adding those updates include the situation in the Middle East plus other foreign and domestic issues.

The Bidens are expected to stay in the Santa Ynez Valley for the rest of the week.

The [Federal Aviation Administration](http://www.faa.gov/)
 issued temporary flight restrictions for Tuesday through Sunday around the Santa Ynez Airport.

Multiple military aircraft also have attracted attention while flying and landing around the Santa Ynez and Santa Maria airports last week.

[As Noozhawk previously reported](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-may-be-headed-to-santa-ynez-valley-to-vacation-this-week/)
, the vacation follows Biden’s DNC speech making the case for Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Once expected to accept the Democratic nomination for president, Biden stepped aside in July, saying he believed it would be “in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down.”

The timing of a vacation some 2,000 miles from the convention and in a sleepy community likely helps avoid Biden inadvertently upstaging Harris and Walz as the party moves to a new generation. 

The White House confirmed the Bidens were staying at the Santa Ynez Valley ranch of billionaire Joe Kiani, a family friend and a big political donor. He and Jill Biden briefly [met with a group of teachers](https://www.noozhawk.com/santa_barbara_teachers_meet_with_bidens_tour_air_force_2_20140321/)
 and gave them a tour of Air Force Two.

On August 2, 2024, CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-russia-prisoner-swap-landing-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/02/biden-harris-greet-us-america-russia-prisoner-exchange)) reported on the return of three freed Americans after a prisoner swap with Russia. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris greeted the returnees at Joint Base Andrews. The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ck7gwe808yet)) also reported on the event.

The articles mention that the families of the freed Americans were present. The Guardian article includes a photograph of Biden and Harris greeting the freed Americans (<image:5704>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home.

[! When I heard about this, I said, 'I'm going to come by on my lunch break,'" said Santa Barbara resident Beth Hassenplug who came with her mom.

At the same time, information began circulating that the 747 Air Force plane that normally serves as Air Force One was in the airspace above Lompoc presumably coming to Vandenberg Space Force Base.

Wayne Wilcox of Santa Barbara saw the Boeing 757 but wanted to see the larger plane. "I'd rather see the 747 that would be the most iconic, that is what I was expecting to see actually."

For those following the air traffic controllers upon arrival, "whenever I hear them  say 'Air Force One you are cleared to land', it's just just an awesome thing to hear," said Carpinteria resident Mark Dotter who came to the location like others for a close-up.

With logistics always ready to change at a moments notice, it is unclear what the exact transportation plans will be when the President and family members leave this weekend.

Around the Santa Ynez Valley, First Lady Jill Biden was seen shopping at a bookstore, a general store, and a candy store today.

Heavy Secret Service and California Highway Patrol presence is in the area.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris greeted the returnees at Joint Base Andrews. The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ck7gwe808yet)) also reported on the event.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. The Yahoo News article states that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the freed prisoners home. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect requires further verification.

Air Force One is one of the most recognisable planes in the world – and you’ve likely seen more of it as US president Joe Biden hops on and off while campaigning for the upcoming presidential [election](https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/trump-biden-election-updates-live/news-story/cab7696d26cffedcd23e96161a968876)

Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary stepping off Air Force One after arriving at Sydney Airport for the start of his then Aussie tour in 1996.

But while it’s one of the most famous planes in the world, boasting the iconic Kennedy-era blue-and-white design, what’s often not known is what’s on the interior.

Most footage and photos we see are of presidents climbing the stairs, getting to the top and looking back as they give a wave before heading inside.

But what awaits them inside is basically a mobile White House in the sky.

As they step foot inside, in this case, Mr Biden, he’s greeted with his very own extensive suite that features a large office, lavatory and conference room.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether the plane was empty when he boarded. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect remains unverified.

  ! The White House isn't worried](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/18/1157955440/biden-age-2024-election)

The White House has mainly brushed aside questions about the change and won't say much about it, other than there are a series of factors that go into whether he uses the short or tall stairs, including security, weather and the availability of rolling staircases.

When Biden lands at an airport where officials roll out the red carpet to welcome him, he still uses the tall stairs.

President Biden boards Air Force One at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo. on June 1, 2023, after attending the 2023 United States Air Force Academy Graduation Ceremony.

It's one of the iconic images of the American presidency: the commander in chief, standing and waving to the cameras from the top of the stairs leading into Air Force One.

But recently, President Biden has been avoiding climbing up the sometimes-wobbly 18-foot staircase that is trucked over to the plane's upper door. The short stairs have the distinct advantage of moving most of Biden's ascent into Air Force One out of public view. **Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP** ****hide caption****

### There's an art to avoiding bad optics

When the American president travels, every detail is carefully choreographed, right down to the stairs the president uses to get on and off Air Force One. <image:5782>

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans returned to the U.S. in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether the plane was empty when he boarded. The Times of India article states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the "empty plane" aspect remains unverified. To fully verify the claim, information about the presence of passengers or crew members on the plane when Biden boarded is needed.

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)

 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)

, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that with the current way of fighting, it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. The article also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war. The article also states that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured as of January 2025, while Donald Trump estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed in January 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While the Wikipedia article mentions estimates that approach this number, they are for earlier dates (July 2024) and include casualties, not just losses. The other sources provide different figures for different timeframes, making it difficult to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses, including the definition of "loss" (killed, wounded, missing, captured), and the exact timeframe (February 2025) would be needed.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides conflicting estimates of Russian troop losses in the Ukraine war. Some sources estimate casualties (killed and wounded) nearing the claimed number, but for earlier dates. Other sources provide different figures for different timeframes.

The claim cannot be verified due to conflicting information and a lack of specific data on troop losses for February 2025. `not enough information`

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured as of January 2025, while Donald Trump estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed in January 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While the Wikipedia article mentions estimates that approach this number, they are for earlier dates (July 2024) and include casualties, not just losses. The other sources provide different figures for different timeframes, making it difficult to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses, including the definition of "loss" (killed, wounded, missing, captured), and the exact timeframe (February 2025) would be needed.

Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. This statistical method, created in collaboration with _Meduza_, helps to account for the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

About our reports
-----------------

This publication is divided into two parts:

**Bi-weekly Summary.** A text summary, updated every two weeks, in which we report on what we have learned about recent losses and the frontline events that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part provides visualisations of the losses since the start of the war, showing, for example, where the dead served or which regions they came from. We update the data for these graphics, while the accompanying text is refreshed but remains largely the same.

A detailed description of our method for estimating total deaths using Probate Registry data can be [found at this link](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k-trl)
.

**Last update to the named list:** August 29, 2025.

**Last update to the Probate Registry estimate:** August 29, 2025; estimate as of August 2025

Full named list of verified losses is available here: [**200.zona.media**](https://200.zona.media)

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. These are absolute figures and have not been adjusted for population or number of military units.

You can filter the map to show total losses, losses by branch of service, or the home regions of mobilised soldiers who were killed.

In most cases, official reports or visual cues like uniforms and insignia allow us to determine a soldier’s branch of service, or how he came to be in the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.).

The chart below compares these different groups of servicemen.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. In our next analysis, we will also be able to investigate the mortality peak of late 2024 in greater depth.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

The map below shows the distribution of casualties across Russia’s regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior officer in the General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/04/25/balashikha)
 by a car bomb in a Moscow suburb in April 2025.

Two deputy army commanders, Major General [Andrei Sukhovetsky](https://admnvrsk.ru/o-gorode/novosti/glavnye-novosti/news-03032022200708-105771/)
 (41st Army) and Major General [Vladimir Frolov](https://www.fontanka.ru/2022/04/16/71262053/)
 (8th Army), were killed in the first weeks of the war. In November 2023, Major General Vladimir Zavadsky, deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2023/12/04/zavadsky)
 near the village of Krynky.

In November 2024, Major General Pavel Klimenko, commander of the 5th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade (formerly the “Oplot” Brigade of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic), [was fatally wounded](https://zona.media/news/2024/11/07/klimenko)
 by an FPV drone.

In July 2025, a strike on the headquarters of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade [killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/07/11/155)
 at least six officers, including the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, Mikhail Gudkov.

The two retired generals on the list are Kanamat Botashev, a pilot who had been dismissed for crashing a fighter jet and was fighting for _Wagner_ _PMC_ when his Su-25 [was shot down](https://zona.media/news/2022/05/31/su27)
 in May 2022, and Andrei Golovatsky, a former Interior Ministry general [serving](https://zona.media/news/2019/02/22/army)
 an 8.5-year prison sentence who was killed in June 2024.

The date of death is known in **98,340** cases."

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war by February 2025 is demonstrably false. While estimates of casualties exist, such as the British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)), these figures do not align with the claim's timeframe or definition of "losses." Furthermore, a Mediazona article from August 29, 2025, estimates around 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Mediazona](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), which is significantly lower than the claimed figure.
