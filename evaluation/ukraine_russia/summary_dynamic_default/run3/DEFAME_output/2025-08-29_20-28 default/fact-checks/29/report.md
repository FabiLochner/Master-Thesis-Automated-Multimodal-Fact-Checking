## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, as reported by Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting)). The meeting was contentious, and NPR's article mentions criticism from top Democratic lawmakers.

The Atlantic Council also published an article about the meeting on the same day ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/the-trump-zelenskyy-meeting-just-blew-up-what-now/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/the-trump-zelenskyy-meeting-just-blew-up-what-now/)). <image:i>, ![image 1982](media/2025-08-07_19-28-1754594926-814280.jpg), ![image 1978](media/2025-08-07_19-28-1754594921-239820.jpg), ![image 1984](media/2025-08-07_19-29-1754594942-051004.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan delegation of the U.S., as reported by Yahoo News (![image 1991](media/2025-08-07_19-29-1754594966-519958.jpg), [https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-met-democrats-205100784.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-met-democrats-205100784.html)). Zelenskyy posted a video of the meeting on X. The article discusses claims that Democrats persuaded Zelenskyy to reject a deal, and Zelenskyy said they discussed his upcoming meeting with President Trump.

ABC News reports that on March 1, 2025, a bipartisan group of senators, including Chris Coons and Amy Klobuchar, met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy before his meeting with Donald Trump on February 28, 2025 (![image 1992](media/2025-08-07_19-29-1754594975-441953.jpg), ![image 1993](media/2025-08-07_19-29-1754594976-847982.jpg), [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including Democrats, before his meeting with Donald Trump on February 28, 2025. The Yahoo News article ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-met-democrats-205100784.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-met-democrats-205100784.html)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439)) both support this.
