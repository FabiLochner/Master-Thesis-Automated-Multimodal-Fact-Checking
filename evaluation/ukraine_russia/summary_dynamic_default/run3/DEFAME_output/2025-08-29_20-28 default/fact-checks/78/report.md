## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 26](media/78.jpg) appears in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, reports on Russia capturing German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region. The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/)) discusses the conflict in the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukraine has made incursions.

The BBC article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025 (![image 5987](media/2025-08-29_20-52-1756500742-276603.jpg)). The Reuters article mentions that Ukraine has lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers, and 404 armored combat vehicles. The BBC article mentions that the roads were littered with destroyed military equipment (![image 5984](media/2025-08-29_20-52-1756500741-540536.jpg), ![image 5989](media/2025-08-29_20-52-1756500743-100086.jpg), ![image 5993](media/2025-08-29_20-52-1756500743-732087.jpg)). The Reuters article includes an image of a crossing point on the border with Russia in the Sumy region (![image 5994](media/2025-08-29_20-52-1756500748-301001.jpg)). The Wikipedia article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces, and provides casualty figures from both sides. The image in the claim is also present in the Wikipedia article (![image 26](media/78.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The image in the claim does depict destroyed military equipment, and the web search confirms that there was a conflict in the Kursk region in August 2024, where Ukraine made incursions. The Reuters article states that Ukraine lost tanks and armored vehicles. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the destroyed tanks in the image are Ukrainian.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively confirmed without additional information.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is present in articles discussing the conflict in the Kursk region in August 2024. The web search confirms that there was a conflict in the Kursk region in August 2024, where Ukraine made incursions and lost tanks and armored vehicles. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the destroyed tanks in the image are Ukrainian.

The claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively confirmed without additional information. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim, showing destroyed tanks, is associated with the conflict in the Kursk region during August 2024, as confirmed by the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign) and the [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/). While the evidence supports the presence of destroyed military equipment and Ukrainian incursions, it does not definitively confirm that the tanks in the image are Ukrainian.
