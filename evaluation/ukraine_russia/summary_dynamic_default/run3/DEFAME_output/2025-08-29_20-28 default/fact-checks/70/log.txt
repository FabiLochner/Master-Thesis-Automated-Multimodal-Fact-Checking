Useful result: From [Source](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/): 
Content: The Journal of Democracy published an article in April 2022 by Robert Person and Michael McFaul titled "What Putin Fears Most". The article discusses Putin's hostile policies toward the United States and his justification for them, including the NATO threat. The article also mentions Putin's view of Ukraine's democracy as a threat. The article includes an image <image:2694> of a demonstration with flags of different countries, including the United States, in support of Ukraine.

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared war on the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to [Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/), there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. Other sources discuss Putin's actions and policies but do not mention a declaration of war against the United States.

So, the overall veracity is: false
