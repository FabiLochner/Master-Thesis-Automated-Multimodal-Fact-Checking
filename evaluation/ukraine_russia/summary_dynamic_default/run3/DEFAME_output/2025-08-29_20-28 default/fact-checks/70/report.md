## Elaboration

Fact Crescendo explicitly states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA, and the claim is unfounded and incorrect ([Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/)). The BBC and Journal of Democracy articles discuss Putin's policies and justifications for actions, but do not mention a declaration of war against the United States.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple reliable sources confirm that there has been no declaration of war by Russia against the United States. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

According to [Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/), there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. Other sources discuss Putin's actions and policies but do not mention a declaration of war against the United States.
