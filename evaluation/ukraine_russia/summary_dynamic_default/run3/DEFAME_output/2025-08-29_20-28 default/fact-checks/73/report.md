## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base, Calif., in May 2019. The crash was caused by improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system. The pilot ejected and survived. The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, and the article explains that the missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

## Elaboration
The image depicts the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in California in May 2019. The crash was due to improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system, not because it was shot down. The pilot ejected and survived. The claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image shows a crash that occurred in California in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a 2019 crash of an F-16 near March Air Reserve Base in California, caused by mechanical failure, not a Ukrainian jet shot down by Russia, as evidenced by articles from the [Press-Enterprise](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/), [Air & Space Forces Magazine](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/), and the [San Bernardino Sun](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/).
