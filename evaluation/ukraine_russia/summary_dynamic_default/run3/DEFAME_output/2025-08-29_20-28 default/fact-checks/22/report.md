## Claim
Claim: "![image 12](media/22.jpg) This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 12](media/22.jpg))
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
There is no evidence to support the claim. The reverse image search did not yield any results. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Actions
```
image_search("chemical explosion road")
geolocate(![image 12](media/22.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-louisiana-business-evacuation/story?id=124900678](https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-louisiana-business-evacuation/story?id=124900678)) contains an image of a large fire and explosion ![image 5639](media/2025-08-29_20-31-1756499514-308195.jpg). The WAAYTV article ([https://www.waaytv.com/news/nation-world/a-fire-at-a-georgia-chemical-plant-is-forcing-evacuations-and-road-closures/article_b3eadcfc-f36d-55a1-9194-2962b68f2b46.html](https://www.waaytv.com/news/nation-world/a-fire-at-a-georgia-chemical-plant-is-forcing-evacuations-and-road-closures/article_b3eadcfc-f36d-55a1-9194-2962b68f2b46.html)) shows a fire at a Georgia chemical plant ![image 5641](media/2025-08-29_20-31-1756499514-860305.jpg). The third source ([https://www.gwclaw.com/blog/waukegan-chemical-explosion-video-released/](https://www.gwclaw.com/blog/waukegan-chemical-explosion-video-released/)) has no content.


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The image search results show examples of explosions and fires, but none of them match the image in the claim. The geolocation analysis suggests several possible locations, including Ukraine and Russia, but the probability is low. The evidence does not support the claim.


## Actions
```
web_search("Kursk offensive August 2024 chemical attack")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, with Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast. The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/whats-behind-ukraines-surprise-incursion-into-russias-kursk-region](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/whats-behind-ukraines-surprise-incursion-into-russias-kursk-region)) mentions the incursion and includes images related to it ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) provides details about the campaign, including the involvement of Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces. The RAND article ([https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/the-kursk-offensive-triumph-or-tragedy-in-the-making.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/the-kursk-offensive-triumph-or-tragedy-in-the-making.html)) has no content.


## Elaboration
The search results confirm the existence of the Kursk offensive in August 2024. However, none of the provided sources mention a chemical attack. The Al Jazeera article includes images related to the incursion, but there is no evidence to suggest that the image in the claim is related to the Kursk offensive. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image search and web search did not yield any results that support the claim. The geolocation analysis suggests several possible locations, but the probability is low. The search results confirm the existence of the Kursk offensive in August 2024, but none of the provided sources mention a chemical attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsubstantiated. While the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is confirmed by sources like the [Al Jazeera article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/whats-behind-ukraines-surprise-incursion-into-russias-kursk-region) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign), there is no evidence from image searches or web searches to support the assertion of a chemical attack by Ukrainian forces.
