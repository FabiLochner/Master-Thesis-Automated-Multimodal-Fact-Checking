# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The image search results show examples of explosions and fires, but none of them match the image in the claim. The geolocation analysis suggests several possible locations, including Ukraine and Russia, but the probability is low. The evidence does not support the claim.

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct. It said "the absence of any significant military units of the Russian Federation on the border at the time of the attack and the simultaneous continuous conduct of aggressive military operations for more than 900 days on the territory of sovereign Ukraine is the best proof that Putin is lying again about 'protecting Russia.' He doesn't care about Russia, he is only protecting himself."[\[59\]](#cite_note-cnn-conscripts-61)

[NATO](/wiki/NATO "NATO")
 Secretary-General [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg")
 called the Ukrainian incursion "legitimate" and within Kyiv's right to self-defense, adding that the bloc did not receive prior information about the operation and did not play a role in it.[\[346\]](#cite_note-348)

### Evaluation of the offensive

The _BBC_ reported that the August 2024 offensive was the first incidence since [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 that Russian territory had been occupied by foreign forces (although other sources state that foreign jihadists occupied some Russian territory during the [War in Dagestan](/wiki/War_in_Dagestan_(1999) "War in Dagestan (1999)")
 in 1999).[\[347\]](#cite_note-349)
[\[348\]](#cite_note-350)
 The incursion has been dubbed the "second battle of Kursk", in allusion to [the 1943 battle](/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk "Battle of Kursk")
 in the same region.[\[349\]](#cite_note-351)
[\[350\]](#cite_note-352)
 The offensive is also larger than earlier ground raids, with at least two [brigades](/wiki/Brigade "Brigade")
 from the regular Ukrainian forces participating. Finally, on the strategic level, to slow Russia's offensive momentum, to shift the narrative and counter Russian talking points about their inevitable victory, and also to boost Ukrainian morale.[\[355\]](#cite_note-357)

Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
, former chief of staff at the German [Federal Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Defence_(Germany) "Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)")
, stated that the incursion was likely "to establish a [negotiating position](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 and provide relief on other front lines" and that it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces would hold territory in Kursk for long periods of time.[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 Retired Polish General and former commander of special forces, [Roman Polko](/wiki/Roman_Polko "Roman Polko")
, stated that "It's good that Ukraine is taking actions that surprise the Russians," and that "Ukraine is in a defensive position and is unable to conduct an operation to push Russia from the occupied regions, but Ukraine is defending itself in an active way," and that "One can't allow the Russians to comfortably prepare new attacks."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Political analyst [Andreas Umland](/wiki/Andreas_Umland "Andreas Umland")
 suggested that the offensive could bring a quicker end to the war. Kiviselg said that the Russian counterattack in Kursk had "not made significant progress" and had suffered losses, but speculated that the Russian movement may have simply been a probing attack and not the main offensive effort.[\[366\]](#cite_note-368)

By 2 October 2024, nearly two months since the incursion, it was widely agreed that the operation in Kursk had a direct relation with the degradation of Ukraine's eastern front.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Ukraine suffered its steepest loss in territory between mid-August to mid-September, which also coincided with Ukraine's incursion into Kursk according to Pasi Paroinen, analyst of the Black Bird Group.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Rob Lee further supported his earlier argument, stressing that Kursk had stretched Ukrainian personnel thin, added pressure on units holding the line and exacerbated the manpower issues in Ukraine, which is further made worse with heavy losses of experienced Ukrainian soldiers, coupled with new troops sped to the front with limited training.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)

By 20 November 2024, three months into the incursion, Marina Miron, a defence researcher at [King's College London](/wiki/King%27s_College_London "King's College London")
, declared the entire operation to be a costly, strategic failure for Ukraine. Kofman assessed that by early February 2025, the salient created by the offensive had become impossible to hold as Russia had increasingly been able to hinder the use of supply routes.[\[13\]](#cite_note-kursk_gambit_20250401-14)
[\[368\]](#cite_note-370)
 According to another military analyst, Steen Kjærgaard, the US cutting intelligence sharing with Ukraine on 5 March played a major role in Russians retaking Sudzha, with Ukraine lacking information on Russian troop movements.[\[369\]](#cite_note-d947-371)
 Richard Kemp from _[The Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")
_ viewed the entire Kursk operation to be a defeat for Ukraine, as Ukraine had lost any "bargaining chip" to trade land for land in any ceasefire negotiations.[\[370\]](#cite_note-Telegraph-372)

 viewed the operation as a success.[\[371\]](#cite_note-:0-373)

 said that he hesitated to say that the effort by Ukraine was a strategic mistake, that Ukraine had held the Sudzha pocket for a "remarkable" amount of time, and that the Ukrainian offensive had had a "shaping effect on Russian thinking".[\[45\]](#cite_note-guardian_20250310-47)

**Kyiv, Ukraine –** Ukrainian soldiers have entered western Russia in a move that has bewildered Moscow, successfully tested its weak border defences and may deal a blow to its natural gas supplies to Europe.

Kyiv dispatched hundreds of servicemen backed by armoured vehicles, artillery and drones to the Kursk region on Tuesday, according to Russian officials, Ukrainian servicemen and media reports.

 fighting for Ukraine who briefly raided Kursk and neighbouring Belgorod in 2023 and heavy Ukrainian shelling of [Belgorod](/news/2024/7/30/nowhere-is-safe-in-belgorod-fears-grip-russian-region-bordering-ukraine)
 this year.

On Tuesday morning, Ukrainian forces fought through the border and approached Sudzha, a sleepy town of 5,000 people whose central square is still dominated by a statue of Soviet Union founder Vladimir Lenin.

But Sudzha is important as the location of the only pumping station that delivers Russian natural gas to Europe via Ukraine.![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK](/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/INTERACTIVE-ATTACKON-KURSK-1723111797.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

Despite the war, Ukraine still rents its Soviet-era gas pipeline to Russia’s gas monopoly, Gazprom, for $2bn a year.

The transit deal expires in January – if the raid doesn’t stop it now.

Because of the attack, “there is a risk of a pause of \[Russia’s\] natural gas supplies to the European Union via our transit system,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.

The Kursk nuclear power station, one of the world’s oldest, is located in the town of Kurchatov, about 70km (40 miles) east of Sudzha.

Ukrainian drones have been spotted in Kurchatov, and some analysts said Kyiv wants to destabilise the Russian energy system the way Moscow has targeted Ukrainian power stations and its energy grid.

“The main thing \[about the attack\] is energy supplies. The more destabilised they are, the more destabilised the Russian economy is,” Kyiv-based analyst Taras Zahorodniy said in televised remarks.

By Wednesday afternoon, Ukrainians surrounded Sudzha, seized three villages and were spotted near 10 more, Russian officials and media reported.

“In the past 24 hours, our region has been heroically countering the attacks of Ukrainian Nazis,” Kursk acting Governor Aleksey Smirnov wrote on Telegram on Wednesday, repeating the Kremlin’s narratives about the “Nazi junta” in Kyiv.

At least three civilians – two drivers and a woman – have been killed, and 24 have been wounded, including six children, according to Smirnov and health officials.

The governor urged locals to donate blood for the wounded and said “the situation is controllable”.

But even the dry, legalese tone of the Kremlin’s statements cannot hide the gravity of the situation.

President Vladimir Putin [called](/news/2024/8/8/putin-accuses-ukraine-of-major-provocation-in-attack-on-russias-kursk)
 the raid a “full-scale provocation by the Kyiv regime” and accused Ukrainian servicemen of indiscriminately firing at residential areas and civilians.

The Ministry of Defence in Moscow claimed on Wednesday that Ukrainians lost up to 260 servicemen, seven tanks and 42 armoured vehicles, two air defence vehicles and a radio jamming station.

“The operation to annihilate Ukrainian military formations is ongoing,” it said.

‘On a tactical level, Russian resources are being distracted’
-------------------------------------------------------------

Officials in Kyiv have not commented on the attack, but Ukrainian reports claim heavy losses on the Russian side.

Ukrainian forces killed a group of Russian servicemen holed up in a walled Orthodox monastery, shot down a Ka-52 helicopter and destroyed two tanks, Deep State, a Ukrainian Telegram channel known for verified reports, wrote on Wednesday.

At least three Russian servicemen have been taken to Ukraine. They said they were conscripts who underwent brief, incomplete training before being dispatched to the border.

Their commanders “abandoned us, don’t give a damn about us, left us to die”, one of the captured conscripts who identified himself as Daniil Kolesnikov and wore a torn black T-shirt said in a video posted by the Krymsky Veter Telegram channel, a Ukrainian feed.

Ukrainian sources said the attack was a “pre-emptive strike” ahead of a planned Russian invasion of the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, which borders Kursk.

“It’s not about a public relations move or about the extra resources that we have,” Ukrainian serviceman Kyryllo Sazonov wrote on Telegram.

Residents fled Sudzha in droves or are holed up in basements to shelter from Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes, according to the Russian Dva Mayora Telegram channel.

It described the evacuation of civilians as “disorganised” and said some had to leave on foot across fields filled with nettles.

By Tuesday night, “it became obvious that the enemy forces can’t be kicked out of the areas they had occupied” because Ukrainians brought along the Buk air defence systems that prevent strikes by Russian fighter jets and drones, Dva Mayora said.

The move is this year’s most unexpected military development, but its importance is far from strategic, analysts said.

“Results will show whether this is good news or bad news,” said Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

“On a tactical level, Russian resources, reserves will be distracted, are being distracted already,” he told Al Jazeera.

Another observer said that despite heavy losses, the attack may pave the way for a larger strike in the forested, swampy region.

“So far, the reconnaissance raid is somewhat lucky,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.

“We’ll see what would happen next. But early August is the most convenient time to advance on the swampy, heavily impassable terrain,” he said.

But to some Ukrainian servicemen, the attack is nothing but a “distraction” designed to cheer up the public.

“Things in the east are pretty bad, and this raid will for a while blind everyone at home – ‘Look, how ballsy we are."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:12>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
There is no evidence to support the claim. The reverse image search did not yield any results. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Actions
```
image_search("chemical explosion road")

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-louisiana-business-evacuation/story?id=124900678](https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-louisiana-business-evacuation/story?id=124900678)) contains an image of a large fire and explosion <image:5639>. The WAAYTV article ([https://www.waaytv.com/news/nation-world/a-fire-at-a-georgia-chemical-plant-is-forcing-evacuations-and-road-closures/article_b3eadcfc-f36d-55a1-9194-2962b68f2b46.html](https://www.waaytv.com/news/nation-world/a-fire-at-a-georgia-chemical-plant-is-forcing-evacuations-and-road-closures/article_b3eadcfc-f36d-55a1-9194-2962b68f2b46.html)) shows a fire at a Georgia chemical plant <image:5641>. The third source ([https://www.gwclaw.com/blog/waukegan-chemical-explosion-video-released/](https://www.gwclaw.com/blog/waukegan-chemical-explosion-video-released/)) has no content.


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The image search results show examples of explosions and fires, but none of them match the image in the claim. The geolocation analysis suggests several possible locations, including Ukraine and Russia, but the probability is low. The evidence does not support the claim.

The Trump administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine, providing a potentially powerful tool to Kyiv as it continues to face a [relentless assault by Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-attack-hnk-intl)
.

The announcement of the proposed $825 million sale Thursday comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have yet to yield a result and following a deadly night of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital.

It was announced after President Donald Trump met this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin and separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Although the Trump administration has approved a number of sales of equipment to sustain existing weapons, this appears to be the first major arms sale of new weapons to Ukraine announced by the administration.

A source familiar said that if the sale is concluded as expected, the missiles – which have a range of 150-280 miles – could be delivered later this year.

It is unclear whether there will be restrictions on their use.

“Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase,” the notice from the State Department said. “The ERAM is an example of working together with our NATO allies to develop a capable and scalable system capable of being delivered on a fast timeline.”

“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,” it said.

We also examine direct budget support (non-military aid) from the US to Ukraine, stripping out repayable loans, including specifically grants made by the US to Ukraine, and accounting for US funds that were used to collateralise loans. We also note the extensive terms and conditionality of this aid, which meant that the aid was among the most transparent and audited expenditures, and the Government of Ukraine was never in a position to misappropriate any of the funds.

Our analysis concludes that in three years of full-scale war, **the total monetary value of US aid delivered to Ukraine’s government amounts to $50.9 billion**, **of which $18.3 billion comprises military aid**, with the remaining $32.6 billion direct budget support in the form of expense reimbursement through the World Bank and collateral for loans. These figures differ from the appropriation amounts by a factor of two to three (see Figure 1)

![Figure 1 Breakdown of different categories of US aid provided to Ukraine into military (in blue) and direct budget support (in green), with verified values shaded in dark colouring and excess reported amounts in light colouring](/sites/default/files/styles/popup_small/public/2025-03/full_aid_breakdown.png?itok=x9uGOBrS)

We break down US support into eight categories: (1) direct funding via international institutional accounts (e.g. World Bank); (2) loans; (3) collateral for the issuance of loans to the Government of Ukraine; (4) Treasury Account Grants for US defence procurement; (5) direct equipment transfer under Presidential  Drawdown Authority; (6) indirect equipment transfer by purchasing replacement equipment for an ally; (7) so-called ‘lend-lease’ agreements (enacted but never used); and (8) Foreign Military Financing (FMF) accounts, which allowed strategic loans to Ukraine to purchase US defence supplies.

**Direct funding** (1) consists of the $31 billion that the US provided through World Bank accounts managed by USAID contractors Deloitte and KPMG. Poland is a NATO member, so investment in its defence sector is not aid for Ukraine. 

The **lend-lease** (7) programme expired unused.

**Foreign military assistance loans** (8) comprise approximately $9.2 billion in loans allocated by the US for Ukraine and 17 other countries affected by the Russian war to procure American-made military supplies, services, and equipment.

Summing these together, we estimate that the true value of military aid provided by the US to Ukraine totals $18.3 billion, and the direct budgetary support totals $32.6 billion (in the form of reimbursement of expenses or collateral for loans), although this portion also includes overheads by intermediaries, and the true value is likely lower.

The total comes out to $50.9 billion, or less than $17 billion per year. For comparison, it is roughly the cost of maintenance and energy for federal buildings.

In addition, we note that Ukraine has been subject to extensive audits as an aid recipient (US Congress 2023), and there has been no evidence of issues or anomalies unearthed through those mechanisms. Furthermore, budgetary support from the US to Ukraine has often come with conditionality such as Ukraine implementing specific reforms (Yellen 2024).

Overall, despite the US being the largest country-to-country provider of aid to Ukraine, the value provided is significantly smaller than frequently cited numbers, and small in relative terms compared to the US economy. Department of Treasury, 30 December.

WASHINGTON (TND) — The Biden Administration is [still planning on sending $5.9 billion](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/24/white-house-ukraine-military-aid-00180780 "https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/24/white-house-ukraine-military-aid-00180780")
 worth of weapons and equipment to Ukraine but has some obstacles to overcome before the funding expires at the end of the month.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. has given Ukraine more than [$107 billion in military assistance](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congressionally-approved-ukraine-aid-totals-175-billion "https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congressionally-approved-ukraine-aid-totals-175-billion")
 since Russia invaded in 2022.

But where is all the money going?[](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1 "https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1")
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[According to the Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1 "https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1")
:  

> The historic sums are helping a broad set of Ukrainian people and institutions, including refugees, law enforcement, and independent radio broadcasters, though most of the aid has been military-related.

The money and weapons are always accounted for though. Back in January, a [report from the Office of the Inspector General](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/11/2003374323/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2024-043-EEMU_REDACTED%20SECURE.PDF "https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/11/2003374323/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2024-043-EEMU_REDACTED%20SECURE.PDF")
 found at least [one billion dollars worth of weapons](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/11/us-military-aid-ukraine-track-report "https://www.axios.com/2024/01/11/us-military-aid-ukraine-track-report")
 that got sent to Ukraine wasn’t properly tracked and could’ve been stolen, smuggled, or potentially gone to Ukraine’s military but wasn’t properly recorded

Despite all the money and military equipment the U.S. is sending to Ukraine the war is still not over.

[On one front in the north](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/g-s1-17561/ukraine-russia-war-three-fronts "https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/g-s1-17561/ukraine-russia-war-three-fronts")
, Ukrainian troops carried out a surprise invasion into Russian territory and have maintained that ground since early August. But on another in the East, Russian forces are making steady advances and are closing in on a town with the majority of Ukraine’s military supply lines. 

But [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has a victory](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-victory-sets-a-deadline-for-partners-speedy-and-strategic-steps-needed-from-today-and-until-december/ "https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-victory-sets-a-deadline-for-partners-speedy-and-strategic-steps-needed-from-today-and-until-december/")
 plan he’s going to present to Biden next week.

Ukraine isn’t the only recipient of massive amounts of foreign aid from the U.S."

From [Source](https://internationalpolicy.org/publications/maintaining-transparency-in-us-security-assistance-to-ukraine/): 
Content: "After 2014 and the events of [Euromaidan](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-ukraines-euromaidan-protests)
, officials in Kyiv promised to crack down on corruption throughout society, including in its [defense sector](https://www.corruptionjusticeandlegitimacy.org/post/accomplishing-the-impossible-how-ukraine-advanced-anti-corruption-reforms-in-defense-security)
. 

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the US government has been caught between three competing demands: surging defense articles and services to Ukraine, ensuring accountability for US arms shipments, and managing escalation risks. arms transfers, informing procedures and policies for future transfers.

##### US Security Assistance to Ukraine

Since 2015, the United States government [has](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/6707)
 trained and equipped the Ukrainian military through Operation Atlantic Resolve. Drawdowns and supplemental bills have become the main methods to appropriate funds for Ukrainian assistance, including humanitarian aid. 

Initially, the US supplied light weapons and small arms, like [Javelin anti-tank missiles](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-plane-brings-military-equipment-munitions-ukraine-2022-01-25/)
, and has since expanded to include artillery, tanks, and long-range ordinance [like](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-quietly-shipped-long-range-atacms-missiles-ukraine-2024-04-24/)
 the Army Tactical Missile. In September 2002, the State Department announced that two years prior, Ukraine’s president Leonid Kuchma [illegally](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002-10/news/us-says-ukrainian-president-approved-arms-sale-iraq)
 sold missiles to Iraq, and in light of this, the US put a hold on a portion of its aid to the country. In August, the Government Accountability Office [found](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/08/us-still-needs-improve-monitoring-arms-sent-ukraine-gao-finds/398950/)
 that the State Department and the Pentagon have not always communicated on how to properly ensure that end-use monitoring is being implemented. This figure leaves out the [non-military](https://www.gao.gov/blog/ukraine-aid-important-so-oversight-funding-and-assistance)
 aid to Ukraine from the US, and it excludes the [tens of billions of aid](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 provided to the country since Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. While the sheer amount of aid has caused [political](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/23/ukraine-kursk-offensive-russia-weapons/)
 [disputes](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-stalled-u-s-aid-for-ukraine-exemplifies-gops-softening-stance-on-russia)
 in Washington, it has been a relatively successful program so far. <image:5982>

If the US government succeeds in helping Ukraine defend its territory without the arms being diverted to forces outside Ukraine, or used by Ukrainian forces in acts in violation of international humanitarian law, it could emerge as a useful precedent for promoting transparency in U.S. With [an incursion](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-incursion-into-kursk-consistent-with-us-policy/)
 into Russia’s European territory, Ukraine has expanded the battlefield to include both legally Ukrainian and Russian soil.

[Since](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898)
 the Trump Administration, the United States government has been more transparent about security assistance to Ukraine than arms shipments to other countries. Scandals like this, in addition to Ukraine’s political instability, meant the US government was reluctant to provide military aid to the country."

The evidence indicates that the claim is not supported by the available information. While there are reports of military aid from the US to Ukraine and some issues with tracking equipment, there is no evidence to suggest that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the US has provided significant military aid to Ukraine, and there have been issues with tracking some equipment, there is no evidence to suggest that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. Sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/politics/trump-missile-sale-ukraine) and [forumarmstrade.org](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html) detail aid packages and sales but do not mention Ukraine selling armaments.
