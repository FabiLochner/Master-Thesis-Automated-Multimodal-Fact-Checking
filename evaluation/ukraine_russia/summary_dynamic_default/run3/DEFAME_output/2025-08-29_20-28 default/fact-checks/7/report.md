## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) states that the claim that BlackRock asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers on land it owns is false. The claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was shared by Russian and Chinese media. BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine, and foreign companies and individuals are prohibited from purchasing arable land. ![image 214](media/2025-08-06_17-32-1754501530-274079.jpg)

Mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/head-of-blackrock-circulates/](https://mythdetector.com/en/head-of-blackrock-circulates/)) fact-checks a claim that Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, called for the cremation of Ukrainian soldiers, stating that the quote is disinformation and originated from an anonymous Russian-language TikTok account. ![image 220](media/2025-08-06_17-33-1754501584-250119.jpg) Detector Media states that propagandists falsely claim BlackRock owns 47% of Ukraine's territory and asked not to bury soldiers on its land. The Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund to attract private investment for the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) states that BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine, and foreign entities are prohibited from purchasing arable land. The claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was spread by Russian and Chinese media.

Furthermore, Detector Media states that the claim is part of a broader false narrative that BlackRock owns a significant portion of Ukraine's territory and has imposed restrictions on burial practices. The agreement between the Ukrainian government and BlackRock and JPMorgan was for attracting private investment, not for land ownership or burial restrictions.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources confirm that BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine and that the claim originated from a false narrative.
