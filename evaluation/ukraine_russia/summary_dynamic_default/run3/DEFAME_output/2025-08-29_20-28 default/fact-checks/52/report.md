## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that after the call between Trump and Putin on February 12, 2025, Trump announced that they had agreed to begin peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. NPR reported that they agreed to start talks toward a ceasefire, beginning with a 30-day halt to strikes on energy infrastructure ([https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call)). Reuters reported that Trump ordered officials to begin talks on ending the war ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)).

The evidence does not state that an agreement to end the war was reached, but rather that talks would begin.


## Final Judgement
After the call between Trump and Putin on February 12, 2025, Trump announced that they had agreed to begin peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. However, the evidence does not state that an agreement to end the war was reached, but rather that talks would begin.
