Content: Al Jazeera published an article on February 21, 2025, fact-checking claims about Ukraine and its leader. The article states that in a February 2 interview with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s military has received only a portion of the billions in US aid earmarked for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Zelenskyy cited a total of $177bn or $200bn spent by the US and said Ukraine had not received about $100bn of that total. <image:k> The article also mentions that the US has spent $183bn to help Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/): 
Content: Pravda.com.ua published an article on February 2, 2025, reporting that Zelenskyy stated Ukraine received about $76 billion of the approximately $177 billion in aid approved by the U.S. <image:3378>. The article cites an interview with the Associated Press. The article also mentions a suspension of foreign aid programs by the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **partially supported** by the evidence. Zelenskyy did make statements about the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine, as reported by [Izvestia](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked), and [Pravda.com.ua](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/). However, the evidence does not support the assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
