Useful result: From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The Mediazona article, updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war by August 2025. The article also mentions a peak of approximately 3,000 deaths per week in November 2024.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war by February 2025 is demonstrably false. While estimates of casualties exist, such as the British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)), these figures do not align with the claim's timeframe or definition of "losses." Furthermore, a Mediazona article from August 29, 2025, estimates around 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Mediazona](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), which is significantly lower than the claimed figure.

So, the overall veracity is: false
