## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." The story originated on a pro-Russian Telegram channel, and there is zero evidence to support the claim. The Forbes article mentions Valerii Zaluzhnyi as one of the individuals named in the claims. ![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg)
