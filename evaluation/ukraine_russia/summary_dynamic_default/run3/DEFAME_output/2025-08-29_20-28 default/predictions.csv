","However, a representative for BlackRock said the claim was baseless.

""According to our research over large land leases in Ukraine presented in our report; 'War and Theft, the Takeover of Ukraine's Agricultural Land', BlackRock doesn't own any land in Ukraine"", he told AFP on August 22 (archived link).
Agricultural land privatisation began in Ukraine in 2021, Mousseau said, potentially providing indirect exposure to land assets, but no single investor could reach 47 percent of the country's total land mass in this way.
Foreigners are not permitted to buy agricultural land in Ukraine and can only buy non-agricultural land if they meet certain legal conditions, according to the Land Code of Ukraine (archived link).
""BlackRock owns part of Ukraine's debt through Eurobonds, which gives the company leverage over the country,"" Mousseau added.

According to a CNN report, Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, and the BBC and Meduza articles mention the Kursk Offensive and Sudzha, supporting the possibility of Zelensky visiting the area at that time. However, the evidence does not verify whether Zelensky met with representatives of the people, making the claim only partially accurate.

The White House, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment.
The latest poll, part of a project funded by The British Academy, surveyed 1,600 people between November 2024 and January 2025. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of Zelenskiy's actions as president, 26.1% of respondents said they “completely approve” and 36.9% said they “tend to approve”.
Another KIIS survey, carried out from February 4-9 this year, found 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskiy. The poll showed 37% of respondents do not trust him.
Anton Hrushetskyi, director of KIIS, told Reuters that while similar, trust and approval are not identical concepts. He said a person can approve of someone's activities, but that does not necessarily mean that they trust them.
Olga Onuch, a professor in comparative and Ukrainian politics at the University of Manchester who worked with KIIS to produce the surveys, said in a statement on Wednesday, opens new tab: “Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic - Zelenskiy remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine. Spreading misinformation about his legitimacy directly aids Kremlin propaganda and undermines the Ukrainian people's right to determine their own future.”"

As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation.

","For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term ""lost"" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was ""interested primarily from the standpoint of death,"" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: ""Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months."" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were ""recoverable."" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a ""minimum"" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550."

A Newsweek analysis of similar claims made in 2022, the year the war began, reveals a coordinated effort by Russian disinformation networks to spread false narratives about Ukraine's handling of Western-supplied weapons. This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support."
