The image is a fabricated front page of the Hull Daily Mail, as confirmed by fact-checks from sources like [Gwara Media](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/) and [The Journal.ie](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/), which show the real front page from March 13, 2025, had a different headline.
",True,"But the supposed Hull Daily Mail headline blasting Zelensky over the Kursk incursion is a fabrication.

1,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest, or Kehlsteinhaus, in Berchtesgaden in the southern German state of Bavaria, for 14.2 million euros.",False,False,"The claim is disputed. While one source, AOL, states the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, contradicting the claim, another source, EADaily, supports it. Given the conflicting information and the potential for fabricated evidence, the claim is considered false.
",True,"The Eagle's Nest is in the property of the state of Bavaria. The administration of state-owned real estate is the responsibility of IMBY, which is listed in the alleged purchase agreement. On February 7, 2025, the company posted a press release on its website in which it called the claim ""deliberate misinformation"". The Eagle's Nest ""continues to be owned by the Free State of Bavaria"", the state-owned company stated. It said that a sale had neither taken place nor was planned. IMBY also addressed details from the video: ""The alleged purchase agreement shown in the video is a forgery, and the same applies to the alleged quote from IMBY's management"". It will also take legal action against the misinformation."

",True,"A spokesperson for Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, said the company has not launched the micro-blogging site in Ukraine.
""Reports that Truth Social was blocked in Ukraine are false -- Truth Social has never been available in Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said in a February 20 email.
After the claims about Zelensky banning Truth Social began circulating on social media, a spokesperson for Ukraine's foreign ministry posted on X, saying state officials had not banned the platform because it is ""unfortunately"" not available in the country (archived here).
""We would appreciate it if the Truth Social would add Ukraine to their authorized region of operations,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on February 20."

While the image shows coffins draped with the Union Jack, there is no evidence to verify the image's context or the claim that it depicts the coffins of British Special Forces killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region.
",True,"A reverse image search and keyword searches on Google and Russian search engine Yandex found the image published on news agency PA Media's website (archived link).

6,<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.,False,False,"The claim is false. While there were reports of F-16s being involved in combat in Ukraine in August 2024, the specific scenario described in the claim, involving a US F-16 shot down over the Black Sea, is not supported by the evidence. The image appears to depict a MiG-29, not an F-16.
",True,"While a US-made F-16 -- supplied to Ukraine by its Western allies -- crashed during a combat mission in August 2024, the image shows a Russian MiG-29 that collided with another aircraft during an airshow on July 24, 1993."

",True,"However, a representative for BlackRock said the claim was baseless.
""This is completely false,"" the spokesperson told AFP on August 22. ""BlackRock Inc. does not own any land in Ukraine.""
A spokesperson for the land committee of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UCAB) told AFP on the same day: ""We haven't heard about anything like that.""
Frederic Mousseau, policy director at the US-based Oakland Institute think tank -- which has published reports on agricultral land reform in Ukraine -- confirmed BlackRock does not own land in the country, although it does hold other Ukrainian assets (archived link).
""According to our research over large land leases in Ukraine presented in our report; 'War and Theft, the Takeover of Ukraine's Agricultural Land', BlackRock doesn't own any land in Ukraine"", he told AFP on August 22 (archived link).
Agricultural land privatisation began in Ukraine in 2021, Mousseau said, potentially providing indirect exposure to land assets, but no single investor could reach 47 percent of the country's total land mass in this way.
Foreigners are not permitted to buy agricultural land in Ukraine and can only buy non-agricultural land if they meet certain legal conditions, according to the Land Code of Ukraine (archived link).
""BlackRock owns part of Ukraine's debt through Eurobonds, which gives the company leverage over the country,"" Mousseau added.
""Ukraine has been forced by creditors to undertake an ongoing drastic structural adjustment program aiming at privatise all sectors of its economy."""

The claim incorrectly places the image in the Kursk region in August 2024, despite evidence suggesting Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024.
",True,"A reverse image search and subsequent keyword searches on Google found the same photo -- distributed by the Ukrainian presidential office -- published in AFP's archives on May 29, 2022.

The claim that the toys were photoshopped is not supported by the evidence, as the image was published by a reputable news source and shows the actual scene of the attack.
",True,"Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), told AFP in a July 12 email that the photo shows ""no evidence of digital manipulation or editing.""
He said the Ukrainian government's use of the camera's original RAW file further suggests it ""is not fake or manipulated."" RAW files retain all of the data from the camera's sensor, without any automatic retouching to the image.
Farid said a model trained to distinguish real pictures from those created by artificial intelligence uncovered no signs of AI generation, either. But he added that he could not rule out whether the toys had been propped up or otherwise staged for dramatic effect.
Matthew Stamm, head of Drexel University's Multimedia and Information Security Lab (archived here), said July 13 that he also ""found no evidence of manipulation."""

The Bugatti dealership denied the transaction and filed a criminal complaint.
",True,"The main piece of evidence in the posts is a photo of an invoice with the Bugatti logo.
The document indicates Zelenska should receive the luxury car in 2026. The invoice also says the price is 4,462,400, but it does not specify any currency.
Car Lovers, the firm that owns the Bugatti dealership in Paris, called the document ""fake news"" in a July 2 press release (archived here).
""The Car Lovers group vehemently denies both that this transaction took place and, therefore, that this invoice exists,"" the company said.
""Not only do the mandatory legal notices not appear on the invoice, but the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their description are inexact and incoherent, the visual corporate identity is outdated and the Car Lovers group would never have allowed such a document to be issued.""
The dealership address is misspelled on the invoice, with an ""l"" missing in ""Neuilly-sur-Seine."" The document also lacks mandatory information, such as the applicable value-added tax (VAT), and shows a number used in the Australian banking system but not in France."

",True,"World leaders gathered for a group photo at a summit in London did not remove their jackets in solidarity with Ukraine, and an image shared online appearing to show them doing so has been manipulated."

Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits in public.
",True,"The photo of a suited Zelenskiy shaking Klaus Schwab’s hand is from January 2020, two years before Russia invaded Ukraine.
A photo of a suit-wearing Volodymyr Zelenskiy shaking hands with the World Economic Forum’s founder has been presented online as evidence of double-standards by the Ukrainian president, though online discourse omits context that the photo is from years before Zelenskiy adopted more simple, military-style attire in solidarity with his citizens at war with Russia."

While the image shows a screenshot of a Fox News article, the article is not authentic. The publication date is in the future, and multiple sources debunk the claim that Fox News published the article, indicating that the image is manipulated.

",True,"However, a poll, carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, opens new tab (KIIS) found 63% of Ukrainian respondents approved of Zelenskiy, up from 56% in May 2024.
The White House, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment.
The latest poll, part of a project funded by The British Academy, surveyed 1,600 people between November 2024 and January 2025. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of Zelenskiy's actions as president, 26.1% of respondents said they “completely approve” and 36.9% said they “tend to approve”.
Another KIIS survey, carried out from February 4-9 this year, found 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskiy. The poll showed 37% of respondents do not trust him.
Anton Hrushetskyi, director of KIIS, told Reuters that while similar, trust and approval are not identical concepts. He said a person can approve of someone's activities, but that does not necessarily mean that they trust them.
Olga Onuch, a professor in comparative and Ukrainian politics at the University of Manchester who worked with KIIS to produce the surveys, said in a statement on Wednesday, opens new tab: “Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic - Zelenskiy remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine. Spreading misinformation about his legitimacy directly aids Kremlin propaganda and undermines the Ukrainian people's right to determine their own future.”"

",False,"Zelenskiy told reporters at a joint press conference with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz on Dec. 9 that he hoped to call outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden in the coming days to discuss an invitation to the military alliance.
He did also say that he saw no reason to speak to Trump.
However, these comments presented alone lack important context, as Zelenskiy said he saw no reason to speak to Trump, because Trump was not yet the sitting president."
17,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in the Courchevel ski resort in France.,False,False,"The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel, France, is false.

Evidence from sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war) indicates that the U.S. has provided approximately $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. Additionally, a [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) article from February 2025 discusses the Trump administration's boost to military aid, including weapons sales, which is significantly less than the claimed amount.
",True,"It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.
Trump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false."

While a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy.

",True,"Zelenskyy did say, ""The U.S. will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending [our] sons and daughters to war."" However, he was talking about a hypothetical situation in which Ukraine losing the war against Russia would lead to a broader conflict resulting in Americans being pulled into fighting. He made this statement in February 2023, two years before the exchange with Trump took place."

Zelenskyy's asset declaration shows fewer than 15 properties, no U.S. properties, no private planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. His real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, and his 2022 income was $306,000.
",True,"The Ukrainian president submitted a 2024 asset declaration to the National Agency on Corruption Prevention covering 2023 that detailed his owned properties, income, bank accounts and vehicles. The NACP is a Ukrainian government unit that takes asset declarations from all politicians who receive a salary from the state. 
According to the declaration, Zelenskyy owned fewer than 15 properties, none of them in the U.S., owned no planes and had an annual income of around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. Records searches in Florida's 67 counties revealed no properties in Zelenskyy's name.
The declaration listed just one overseas bank account holding 350,272 euros (around $377,000). Given the above, we rate this claim false."

What's False
... but that meeting also included at least three Republican senators. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, emphatically rejected claims that the Democrats of the U.S. Senate delegation had dissuaded Zelenskyy from taking the minerals deal. Further, Zelenskyy confirmed to reporters two days after the meeting that his country was ready to accept the deal."
30,"In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.",False,False,"The evidence from multiple news sources, including Reuters, BBC, and Al Jazeera, indicates that the war between Ukraine and Russia was ongoing in August 2025, with no peace deal reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing conflict, potential negotiations, and disagreements between the involved parties, contradicting the claim.
",True,"Claims of a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia actually repeat key parts of a proposed U.S.-Ukraine agreement for sharing revenue from Ukraine's natural assets, including minerals. This agreement is not a peace deal but would bring Americans to Ukraine and give the U.S. a vested interest in peace in the country."
31,"In August 2024, Ukraine passed legislation banning the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.",False,True,"In August 2024, Ukraine enacted a law targeting religious organizations linked to the Russian Orthodox Church, potentially leading to the banning of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, as reported by Human Rights Watch and the European Parliament ([<image:k>](https://www.hrw.org/)).

She continued, ""And it goes against everything that we stand for. There are terms that we use, we say, 'We respect the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of countries,' right?

",True,"The claim was false, however. If Putin had made such a request, reliable news sources in either Russia or the United States would have reported on it. That had not happened. If Russia wanted to extradite Fauci, it would likely have to file a Red Flag Notice with Interpol. That, too, had not happened.
Even if the claim came from a reliable source of information, there's a major hurdle standing in the way: The United States and Russia do not have an extradition treaty with each other. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. does not generally extradite without a treaty. "

Melania Trump addressed the photos in September 2024, saying: ""Why do I stand proudly behind my nude modeling work? The more pressing question is, why has the media chosen to scrutinize my celebration of the human form in a fashion photo shoot? Are we no longer able to appreciate the beauty of the human body?"""

",True,"A Facebook post said Zelenskyy ""engaged in election interference by campaigning"" in Pennsylvania for Harris.
In September 2024, Zelenskyy visited a Scranton ammunition plant to thank its workers who were producing munitions for Ukraine. A video of his visit shows Zelenskyy touring the site and thanking workers.
Although Shapiro served as a Harris campaign surrogate, he attended the Scranton event in his official capacity as governor. Harris did not attend the Scranton event. Zelenskyy met with Harris and Trump separately later the same week.
Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton plant was not covert, and experts said it doesn’t meet any definition of foreign election interference.

",True,"After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was fatally shot March 10 in Austin, Texas, police said they believe the suspects were burglarizing White’s car when White interrupted them.
White is not on a Ukrainian enemies list. In June 2024, Texty.org.ua, an independent Ukrainian media outlet, shared online a list of research subjects as part of its analysis of rhetoric opposing Ukrainian aid. White was among the people whose statements were analyzed.

Now, critics of that U.S. support are floating an unsupported claim: that the funding has been misused through corruption or money laundering.
Much of the money the U.S. has dedicated for Ukraine aid is spent in the U.S. on domestic weapons manufacturers and U.S. military and government operations.
Direct military support to Ukraine totaled about $70 billion out of the $175 billion Congress has appropriated. 
The money isn’t being laundered, it’s being spent as Congress intended."

",True," Misbar reviewed Trump and Netanyahu’s full meeting, finding that the claim originated from a misinterpretation in Netanyahu’s statement about the situation in Gaza. After a reporter asked Trump whether the resettlement plans for Gaza were still on the agenda or not, Trump passed the question to Netanyahu, who said that Gaza is “closed in.” Netanyahu answered that people in other war zones, specifying Syria and Ukraine, had a choice to leave the country. Gaza, however, is the only place where people are locked in. He claimed Israel was not restricting them. Netanyahu then asked, “What is wrong with giving people a choice?” referring to the resettlement plans for Gazans."

",True,"Contrary to the viral claim, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not call for a state of emergency in Germany after Trump’s recent peace talks. A closer review of Scholz’s speech reveals that he referred to “Notlage,” not “Notstand” as claimed. In the video, Scholz said, “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.” In German, “Notstand” means a state of emergency that would severely restrict citizens’ rights. However, “Notlage” appears in the German Basic Law and signifies an urgent situation, but it does not equate to a government-imposed state of emergency.”"
52,"After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.",False,False,"On February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). While they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and agreed to begin negotiations, there is no evidence to support the claim that an agreement to end the war was reached.
",True,"Misbar’s team searched for the claimed statement from Trump but did not find any reports from credible media outlets. However, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he had a call with Putin on February 12, 2025, during which they discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, energy, artificial intelligence, and various other subjects. During the call, both presidents agreed to have their teams start negotiations immediately. Trump said he would call President Zelenskyy to inform him of their decision, which he planned to do while writing the post. Media outlets also reported that Ukraine talks would start, citing Trump’s post, but did not report that Trump had reached an agreement to end the war."
53,"As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.",False,False,"The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, a [CSIS article](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine) from June 3, 2025, estimates over 950,000 total Russian casualties between February 2022 and May 2025, including approximately 250,000 fatalities.
",True,"For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term ""lost"" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was ""interested primarily from the standpoint of death,"" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: ""Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months."" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were ""recoverable."" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a ""minimum"" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550."
54,Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States,False,False,"The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While Ukraine's arms sales decreased in 2023, and it is the world's largest importer of arms, with the U.S. as a major supplier, there is no data to confirm that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

",True,"Claims that NATO weapons and ammunition are being put on sale on the dark web have re-surfaced in recent months, but as other outlets have reported, there is no evidence that any such products have actually made it into the hands of a prospective buyer. A Newsweek analysis of similar claims made in 2022, the year the war began, reveals a coordinated effort by Russian disinformation networks to spread false narratives about Ukraine's handling of Western-supplied weapons. This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support."

Stiller met with Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv as part of his role as an ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in 2022. In response to the circulating video, Stiller took to X to refute the claims, stating, ""These are lies coming from Russian media. I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind. 100% false."" Furthermore, there is no evidence to support that E! News posted that video."

",True,"The claim is false. While Trump did sit down with Von for an interview back in August 2024, he did not mention Starmer or the U.K.’s 100-year deal with Zelenskyy.
