## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and claimed to have shot down a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate in 2025. NPR and CNN also report that the Houthis have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The CNN article, published on April 25, 2025, discusses the Houthis' successful targeting of US drones, hindering the US military campaign in Yemen.

The image's location is most likely in Israel. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence does not provide any information about the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that the Houthis have shot down US drones, but it does not provide any information about the image. The image's location is most likely in Israel.

The claim is not supported by the evidence, as the image's origin and context are not verified. Therefore, the claim is considered false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, as reported by the [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission), the image's origin and context are not verified. The image's location is most likely in Israel.
