The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there is evidence of meetings between Mark Rutte and Donald Trump regarding Ukraine, the provided sources, including the NATO website and news articles from NPR and CBS News, do not contain the specific quote attributed to Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

So, the overall veracity is: false
