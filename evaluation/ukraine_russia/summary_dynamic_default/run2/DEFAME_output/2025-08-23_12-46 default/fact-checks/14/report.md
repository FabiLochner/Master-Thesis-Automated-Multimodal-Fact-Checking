## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Fox News article written by Aubrie Spady, titled "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine received $140,000,000 per month from USAID" ![image 11](media/14.jpg). Aubrie Spady is a writer for Fox News Digital.
The article is available on Fox News ([https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady)) and Fox Business ([https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/s/aubrie-spady](https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/s/aubrie-spady)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/) debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The article states that the article was not published by Fox News. The DW article ([dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118)) fact-checks a claim that Fox News reported USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center and states that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The Wikipedia article ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine))) is about the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine, a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. ![image 11](media/14.jpg) ![image 1806](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593661-766175.jpg) ![image 1807](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593662-830512.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is contradicted by the evidence. While the search results confirm the existence of an article with the title mentioned in the claim, other sources debunk the claim that Fox News published it. Furthermore, the article's publication date is in the future, which indicates that the image is manipulated.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a screenshot of a Fox News article with the title "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine received $140,000,000 per month from USAID." However, the evidence indicates that the article is not authentic. The article's publication date is in the future, and other sources debunk the claim that Fox News published it.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the image shows a screenshot of a Fox News article, the article is not authentic. The publication date is in the future, and multiple sources debunk the claim that Fox News published the article, indicating that the image is manipulated.
