## Elaboration
Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. The provided evidence indicates that she discussed the conflict in Ukraine. However, the evidence does not mention any US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

The evidence states that Meloni said she understood the US's response to Russia, but Italy made a different choice. This suggests a divergence in approach, but not a condemnation of a bombing.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention any bombing and does not show that Meloni condemned the US.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, where the conflict in Ukraine was discussed. However, the provided sources do not mention any US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia, nor do they show that Meloni condemned such an action. Instead, Meloni expressed understanding of the US's response to Russia while Italy took a different approach.
