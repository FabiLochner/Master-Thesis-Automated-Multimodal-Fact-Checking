## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the Ukraine war, with an additional 48,000 missing (<image:k>). A Wikipedia article notes that a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, and that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously missing were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provided an estimate of Russian losses, with the last update from February 24, 2025, estimating losses as of December 2024. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, the provided sources offer different figures for February 2025. One source indicates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing as of February 26, 2025. Another source mentions that by early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously missing were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

The Mediazona article, with its last update from February 24, 2025, provides an estimate of losses as of December 2024, but does not specify the exact number. Therefore, the claim of 1.5 million troop losses as of February 2025 is not directly supported by the provided evidence, although the total casualties could be close to that number.

To fully verify the claim, more specific data on the total number of Russian troop losses, including killed, wounded, missing, and captured, as of February 2025, would be needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: According to a CSIS article published on June 3, 2025, there were as many as 250,000 Russian fatalities in Ukraine between February 2022 and May 2025, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties. ![image 4824](media/2025-08-23_13-02-1755954170-208477.jpg), ![image 4825](media/2025-08-23_13-02-1755954170-827400.jpg), ![image 4826](media/2025-08-23_13-02-1755954171-650617.jpg). The article also mentions that the daily average of Russian casualties has increased every year since 2022.


## Elaboration
The new evidence from a CSIS article published on June 3, 2025, states that there were over 950,000 total Russian casualties between February 2022 and May 2025, with approximately 250,000 fatalities. This information contradicts the claim that Russia had lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The initial search results provided estimates and figures that did not align with the claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. The additional search revealed a CSIS article stating over 950,000 total Russian casualties between February 2022 and May 2025, with approximately 250,000 fatalities. This evidence contradicts the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, a [CSIS article](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine) from June 3, 2025, estimates over 950,000 total Russian casualties between February 2022 and May 2025, including approximately 250,000 fatalities.
