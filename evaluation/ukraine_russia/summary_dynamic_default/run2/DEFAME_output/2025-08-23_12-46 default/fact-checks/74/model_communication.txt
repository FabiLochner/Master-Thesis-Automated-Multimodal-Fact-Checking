Ukrainian drones strike a major military depot in a Russian town northwest of Moscow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ![This combo picture shows two satellite images of an ammunition depot in Toropets, Russia, on Saturday Sept. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells.

The attack, which occurred on September 17-18, 2024, caused explosions and fires at the depot. The depot contained various types of missiles, ammunition, and other military equipment. The Associated Press article includes satellite images of the depot before and after the strike, with the images provided by Maxar Technologies. <image:23>

## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. The images do show a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after an attack. However, the evidence indicates that the attack was carried out by Ukrainian drones, not NATO. There is no mention of a nuclear strike.


## Final Judgement
The images do depict a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after an attack. However, the attack was carried out by Ukrainian drones, not NATO, and there is no evidence of a nuclear strike.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The images depict a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after an attack. However, the attack was carried out by Ukrainian drones, not NATO, and there is no evidence of a nuclear strike, as confirmed by the Associated Press article.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that his forces had advanced up to 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of two more settlements there.

Russia said it had struck Ukraine's 22nd and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, and a Guard and Support Brigade in at least 12 different places with air strikes, artillery and infantry.

Moscow said it had also repelled attacks at seven additional places in Kursk and had struck Ukrainian forces at 16 other locations in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region.

"Units of the northern group of forces, with the support of army aviation and artillery fire, repelled attacks by enemy assault groups in the direction of the settlements of Kremyanoye, Malaya Loknya and Nechayev," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

It said Russian forces had also "thwarted attempts to attack in the direction of Komarovka, Spalnoye, Korenevo, Pogrebky and Olgovka."

The ministry said it was seeking to identify and destroy Ukrainian sabotage units which had hidden in the forests in an attempt to penetrate deeper into Russian sovereign territory.

While the Kursk incursion has grabbed headlines, Russian officials say the attack will fail to draw Russian forces away from the east of Ukraine where they are still advancing. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports from either side.

Russia also gave estimates for Ukrainian losses in Kursk, but Reuters does not publish combatant estimates from either side.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."

The image of destroyed tanks (<image:26>) appears in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia published an article on May 19, 2024, discussing the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The sources do not mention any Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results mention the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. Reuters reported that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image. The web search results mention the Kursk offensive and the loss of tanks but do not directly link the image to the event.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the incursion and tank losses are confirmed, the evidence does not directly link the image to the event. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 tanks")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of destroyed tanks (<image:26>) appears in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia published an article on May 19, 2024, discussing the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The sources do not mention any Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the capture of territory, casualties, and the response from Russian authorities, including the declaration of a state of emergency. The article also includes images of damaged buildings and a captured tank. (<image:26>) is not mentioned in the search result. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)

Reuters reported on August 26, 2024, that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers, and 404 armored combat vehicles in the Kursk region. The article also includes an image of a crossing point on the border with Russia in the Sumy region. (<image:4884>) [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/)

Al Jazeera reported on August 29, 2024, on Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region on August 7, 2024. The article mentions that Russia was moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results mention the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. Reuters reported that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image. The web search results mention the Kursk offensive and the loss of tanks but do not directly link the image to the event.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the incursion and tank losses are confirmed, the evidence does not directly link the image to the event. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.


# Your Judgement

The evidence confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results mention the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. Reuters reported that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image. The web search results mention the Kursk offensive and the loss of tanks but do not directly link the image to the event.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the incursion and tank losses are confirmed, the evidence does not directly link the image to the event. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

The evidence confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results mention the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. Reuters reported that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image. The web search results mention the Kursk offensive and the loss of tanks but do not directly link the image to the event.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the incursion and tank losses are confirmed, the evidence does not directly link the image to the event. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

The image search results provide additional context. While the search results include images of tanks, they do not include the specific image in the claim. Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence confirms the incursion and tank losses but does not directly link the image to the event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results include articles about destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war. CNN published an article on April 27, 2022, about destroyed tanks (<image:4885>

## Elaboration
The claim is still unverified. While the evidence confirms the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and the presence of destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war, none of the image searches returned the specific image in the claim. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and the presence of destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war. However, none of the image searches returned the specific image in the claim. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.
