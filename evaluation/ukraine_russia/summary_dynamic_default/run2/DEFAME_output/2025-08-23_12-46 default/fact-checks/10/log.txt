Justification: The image in the claim, published by The Kyiv Independent, depicts the aftermath of a Russian strike on a Kyiv hospital on July 8, 2024, and includes children's toys amidst the debris. The claim that the toys were photoshopped is not supported by the evidence, as the image was published by a reputable news source and shows the actual scene of the attack.
