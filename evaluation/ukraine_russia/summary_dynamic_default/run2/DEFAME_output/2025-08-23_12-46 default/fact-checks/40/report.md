The evidence does not mention Elon Musk planning to suspend Volodymyr Zelenskyy's X account. Instead, it reports that Musk made statements questioning Zelenskyy's popularity and accusing him of exploiting the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Elon Musk made statements about Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February 2025, but they do not include any mention of Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's X account. The evidence focuses on Musk's criticism of Zelenskyy and his comments on polling data.
