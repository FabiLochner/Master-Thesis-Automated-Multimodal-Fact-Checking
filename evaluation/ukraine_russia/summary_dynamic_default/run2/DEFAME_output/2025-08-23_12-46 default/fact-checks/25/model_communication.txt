, who is serving as vice president under Trump.[\[18\]](#cite_note-:4-18)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

Nate Vance, who describes himself as a "Republican-leaning independent" and had been generally supportive of the Trump administration on other issues, said he found his cousin's stance on Ukraine deeply misguided.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:2-11)

One of the most notable statements Nate Vance made was calling his cousin and Trump "_Vladimir Putin's useful idiots._" In an interview with _Le Figaro_, he argued that by halting or reducing support for Ukraine, his cousin and Trump were effectively doing Putin's bidding under the false hope of appeasing the Russian leader. ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-newsweek.com_17-0)

 Nate had attempted to reach out to JD multiple times during his deployment, offering to share his on-the-ground insight, but to no avail.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, faced criticism from Donald Trump and JD Vance during a tense White House meeting. While Brian Glenn, Chief White House Correspondent at Real America’s Voice, donning a blue suit himself, tried to ‘embarrass’ Zelenskyy by asking him whether he owned a suit or not, the Ukranian president gave it back to him by saying, "I will wear a (suit) costume after this war finishes, yes. 

Who is Volodymyr Zelenskyy? 

------------------------------

  
Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician and former entertainer who has served as the sixth and current president of Ukraine since 2019, most notably during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022. 
As per Forbes’ estimate, Zelensky’s entire real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, including two more wholly owned apartments, two that he co-owned, a single commercial property, and five parking spaces. 'Fight On Your Own...'

  
Meanwhile, on Monday, President Donald Trump ordered a 'pause' on US military aid to Ukraine after a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into peace negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy, known for his calm demeanor despite the confrontation, ultimately left without securing a crucial minerals deal. The Ukrainian president was at the White House for a meeting with US President [Donald Trump](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/donald-trump)
, which ended in an ‘unprecedented disaster’ after Trump, along with his VP, JD Vance, engaged in a ‘shouting match’ all the while ‘berating’ Zelenskyy. 
First, it was about Zelenskyy’s outfit (he wore a black sweater – the same color and cut he has donned every time he’s appeared in droopy military fatigues) that was questioned by an American reporter."

Key Findings

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize.
*   Zelensky’s current chief aide, Serhiy Shefir, as well as the head of the country’s Security Service, were part of the offshore network.
*   Offshore companies were used by Shefir and another business partner to buy pricey London real estate.
*   Around the time of his 2019 election, Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Shefir, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore.

Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers reveal that Sri Lankan-Irish businessman Anura Perera, named by the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission as a suspect in the Anglo Leasing procurement scandal, was the owner, director or signatory of at least six offshore firms implicated in the case. In general offshore companies are bad, whether they’re owned by a president or not,” Ryaboshapka said.

He called moving money offshore “an old tradition” in Ukraine, because the country was perceived as a dangerous place with “no rule of law.” But still, the use of such companies today raises red flags of “tax evasion or the legalization of dirty money,” he said.

“That’s the essence of offshore companies.”

Actor Volodymyr Zelensky stormed to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019 on a wave of public anger against the country’s political class, including previous leaders who used secret companies to stash their wealth overseas.

Now, leaked documents prove that Zelensky and his inner circle have had their own network of offshore companies. The show starred Zelensky as a humble history teacher whose anti-corruption rant in class is filmed by a student, goes viral online, and wins him national office.

In a case of life imitating art, Zelensky ended up winning the real-world Ukrainian presidency just three-and-a-half years after the show’s launch, with more than 73 percent of the vote.

Zelensky capitalized on widespread public anger at corruption, but his 2019 campaign was dogged by doubts over his anti-graft bona fides, given that his campaign was boosted by media belonging to Kolomoisky — who is [accused of stealing US$5.5 billion](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/oligarchs-weaponized-cyprus-eranch-of-ukraines-largest-bank-to-send-5-billion-abroad)
 from his own bank and funneling it offshore in concert with his partner, Hennadiy Boholiubov.

In the heat of the campaign, a political ally of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko published a chart on Facebook purporting to show that Zelensky and his television production partners were beneficiaries of a web of offshore firms that allegedly received $41 million in funds from Kolomoisky’s Privatbank.

That ally, Volodymyr Ariev, didn’t provide evidence, and his accusations have never been proven. But the Pandora Papers show that at least some of the details in this alleged scheme correspond to reality. / Alamy Stock Photo\

Serhiy Shefir (right) and Volodymyr Zelensky (left) at Zelensky’s presidential campaign headquarters in 2019.

Serhiy Shefir’s brother Borys, who is a part-owner of Maltex Multicapital Corp, said he may indeed be an owner, but was unaware of the details of the offshore arrangement, which was largely the work of Ukraine’s now-Security Service chief, Bakanov.

“Bakanov was our financial director, he set up the financial schemes of our company. Zelensky has not mentioned Maltex in any of his public asset declarations, including one filed for 2018, when he still owned 25 percent of the company.

In such an arrangement, “the real owner has placed another person to act as his or her proxy to pretend to be the shareholder,” Woods said.

“The person making the transfer wants to retain the shares and the benefit of the shares, but doesn’t want other people to know that that is the situation."

In response to questions sent by Pandora Papers reporters, Fidelity confirmed it was the registered agent for Maltex Multicapital Corp, but it said that Zelensky was not currently an owner or beneficiary of any company under its administration.

“The present Ukrainian president is not our client, nor does he have any ownership or any other position in any entity under our administration,” Fidelity said.

The company also argued that there would have been nothing wrong to have worked for Zelensky prior to his ascent to political office in 2019. The chart showed money flowing from the bank via a series of apparent shell entities to companies alleged to have been owned by Zelensky and associates.

Ariev has not provided documentation to back up his claims.

However, the Pandora Papers documents do provide the first corroboration for elements of his allegation: that 10 of the companies that allegedly received the money really did belong to Zelensky and his partners. The financial flows that are visible from the documents appear to be connected to their television production business, of which Kolomoisky was a client.

The leaked documents show the offshore network was set up by individuals behind Kvartal 95 in 2012, the same year in which local media reported that Kvartal 95 entered into a production deal with Kolomoisky’s 1+1 Group.

The Pandora Papers show that SVT Films Ltd, a company that was as of May 2013 half-owned by the BVI holding company Maltex, was to be paid $1.2 million in licensing fees by January 2013 by an offshore company linked to Kolomoisky’s 1+1 network for the television program “Make a Comedian Laugh.”

In 2015, a company called Gimentiano Holdings Ltd, which was ultimately owned by Zelensky’s friend Andriy Iakovlev, also received $750,000 into its account at the Cyprus branch of Kolomoisky’s Privatbank."

An adviser to Zelenskyy's chief of staff said the president created the offshore companies to 'protect' income from then pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych \[File: Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP\]

Published On 4 Oct 20214 Oct 2021

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office has sought to justify his use of offshore companies as protecting him against pro-Russian forces, following leaked revelations in the Pandora Papers.

A former comedian, Zelenskyy was elected president in 2019 on promises to fight corruption and reduce the influence of oligarchs in the ex-Soviet country.

But the files obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and published on Sunday claimed that Zelenskyy and his partners established a network of offshore companies back in 2012.

The Pandora Papers are based on documents leaked to the ICIJ and exposed the offshore dealings of kings, presidents and prime ministers, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.

According to its findings, two of the offshore companies belonging to Zelenskyy’s partners were used to buy three lavish properties in central London.

The report also found that Zelenskyy, just before he was elected, transferred his stake in one of the offshore companies to his top aide Serhiy Shefir – the target of a shooting attack last month.

An adviser to Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said on Monday that the president had created the offshore companies to “protect” the group’s incomes against the “aggressive actions” of the “corrupt” government of then pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.

“Journalists have de facto confirmed the president’s absolute respect for the standards of anti-corruption legislation,” Mykhailo Podoliak told the AFP news agency.

Podoliak, however, did not comment on the details of other revelations from the investigation, which said that the president’s wife has continued to receive dividends from an offshore company.

Supporters of another ex-president, Petro Poroshenko – a billionaire defeated by Zelenskyy in 2019 and who also appeared in an earlier investigation into offshore companies – accused Zelenskyy of tax evasion.

“He and his accomplices took funds offshore without paying any taxes to the Ukrainian budget,” Iryna Gerashchenko, a lawmaker from Poroshenko’s faction, wrote on Facebook.

Before becoming president, Zelenskyy played a history teacher in a comedy series who was elected president after denouncing endemic corruption.

In his election campaign, he cultivated an image of a leader seeking to “break the system” and promised a fierce fight against corruption in one of Europe’s poorest countries.

The Pandora Papers are the latest in a series of mass ICIJ leaks of financial documents, from LuxLeaks in 2014, to the 2016 Panama Papers, which triggered the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and paved the way for the forced resignation of the leader of Pakistan.

They were followed by the Paradise Papers in 2017 and FinCen files in 2020.

March 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday declared his income for 2022 rose to 12.42 million hryvnias ($306,000) from 3.7 million hryvnias the previous year, with the increase attributable to improved rent collection and sale of some government bonds.

A statement on the president's website said most of the income of the president and his family came from his salary, bank interest and rent payable from his properties.

!Ukraine's President Zelenskiy speaks with India's PM Modi via phone line in Kyiv <image:547>

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi via phone line, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine March 20, 2024. And it reported no major changes in the president's assets or the vehicles he possessed.

In previous declarations, Zelensky reported a family income of 3.7 million hryvnias and in 2021, before the outbreak of the war in 2022, an income of 10.8 million hryvnias. The steep decline in 2022 was attributed to less rental income.

Zelenskiy has called for public officials to disclose their incomes as part of efforts to increase transparency and eliminate corruption as Ukraine tries to meet the stringent requirements for its bid to join the European Union.

Western allies providing weaponry and financial assistance as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund have also sought assurances on efforts to eliminate corruption.

Zelensky's success in the field of entertainment, where he worked for over 20 years as an actor, comedian, and producer, is a major contributor to his wealth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.hindustantimes.com)
 and US President Donald Trump's White House conversation blown out, when Vice President JD Vance suggested that he should be grateful to America for all the support amidst the war and aggression.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC.(AFP)

As the meeting continued, Trump told Zelensky, “You don’t have the cards right now.” However, the Ukrainian President was quick to clap back at the POTUS, saying, “We’re not playing cards.”

Trump's voice got harsher at Zelensky's resistance. Zelenskyy played a schoolteacher who was surprisingly elected president. After he became president in 2019, Zelenskyy gave his partners a 25% stake in the company, which Forbes Ukraine estimates is worth about $11 million. Compared to his entertainment revenues, which included royalties and production income, this is a substantial decrease.

His 2020 financial statement showed that he earned about $623,000."

A screenshot from the Russia 1 segment showing explicit photos of Melania Trump (X/Julia Davis)

The Kremlin-controlled state media channel Russia 1 ran explicit photos of Melania Trump during a segment last week in the wake of her husband's U.S. This is the cover of the magazine GQ," Popov says.

"In one of the shots, the model is only wearing her underwear, lying on a blue carpet with the United States seal, as though the editors of the men's magazine knew something in advance about the future of their model," he added with a smirk.

Beside him, Skabeeva can be seen visibly trying to suppress laughter.

Melania Trump, originally from Slovenia, was a professional model when they [first met in 1998](https://www.today.com/popculture/donald-trump-melania-trump-relationship-timeline-rcna172256)
.

It's not immediately clear why the government-controlled TV and its prime-time news program chose this particular angle. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin suppressed freedom of speech in the country in the early 2000s and placed a tight grip on all mainstream TV networks, with little has been allowed to be aired in Russia without the government's permission.

Trump [won](https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-victory-in-us-election-in-address-to-supporters/)
 the presidential vote on Nov. 6, defeating his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.

The election is expected to have a [profound](https://kyivindependent.com/harris-or-trump-whats-in-store-for-ukraine/)

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive.

“If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

“In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election,” Musk said, referring to Zelenskyy’s decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion.

“I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this. He will not.”

Musk, one of Trump’s [most powerful allies](/news/2025/2/12/elon-musk-appears-at-white-house-defending-doges-work)
 as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X’s community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

The Tesla CEO, who later on Thursday appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference waving a chainsaw in homage to Argentina’s cost-cutting president Javier Milei, also did not substantiate a claim that widely reported polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology was “Zelensky-controlled” and “not credible.”

Lucas Graves, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches misinformation and disinformation, described Musk’s comments as “extremely concerning”.

“As is often the case with this kind of rhetoric, the accusations are a guide to what we have to look out for from the accuser – a world where private platforms like X can be systematically gamed to favour the political interests and alliances of their owners,” Graves told Al Jazeera.

“A well-designed community notes system can be a useful check on misinformation. X is now relying on it too much, and it is ironic that leadership is now complaining that it isn’t working well.”

Musk’s broadside against Zelenskyy comes as the Ukrainian leader and the Trump administration have been [engaged in a war of words](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 over Washington’s efforts to reach a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” after the Ukrainian leader rejected his claims that Kyiv was to blame for the war and raised concerns about being sidelined in Washington’s negotiations with Moscow.

Trump also claimed that Zelenskyy was “very low” in the polls in his country, echoing his earlier claim that the Ukrainian leader had an approval rating of just 4 percent.

In an opinion poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Wednesday, 57 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy, up five points from December.

The Ukrainian leader’s popularity, however, has waned as the war has gone on, dropping from 90 percent in March 2022 to 64 percent in February last year, according to the institute’s polling.

Since taking control of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has been [heavily criticised](/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 for allowing, and in some cases promoting, misinformation on the platform.

An analysis published by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate found that nearly three-quarters of a sample of false or misleading posts about the 2024 US elections did not display accurate notes correcting the record.

“I think there’s a strong chance that X/Twitter becomes a propaganda arm for Musk/Trump – and, in fact, it’s already happening,” Gordon Pennycook, a professor of psychology at Cornell University who studies misinformation, told Al Jazeera.

“I think Musk wants to reform community notes because he doesn’t like being corrected, as is typical for authoritarian oligarchs.”

[Elon Musk](/topic/elon-musk)
 has accused [Volodymyr Zelensky](/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 of “feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers” as the [Trump administration](/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-talks-trump-putin-saudi-arabia-b2699476.html)
 continues ferociously lashing out at the Ukrainian president.

The Tesla owner wrote on his X site, without evidence, that Zelensky is “despised by the people of Ukraine” in a post that refuted Kyiv’s claims that the president has a 57 per cent approval rating. Avoid hateful, derogatory, or inflammatory language.”

As _The Independent_ has [reported](/tech/elon-musk-wikipedia-nazi-salute-free-speech-b2685552.html)
, in practice, Musk’s commitment to free speech and fact-based discussion only goes so far.

The billionaire has called for a boycott of Wikipedia in protest at a change to his page regarding his alleged Nazi salute at the Trump inauguration, and he frequently traffics in inaccurate, unsourced, or fully untrue claims on his own X account. Trump later said Zelensky was a “dictator” who had “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left”.

Musk’s post also vowed to “fix” X’s Community Notes feature, after accusing “governments and legacy media” of gaming the crowd-sourced fact-checking feature.

His comments came in response to a post from an anonymous X account, taking issue with the fact that the polling quoted by Mr Zelensky had been published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.

The post claimed that “U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the foreign aid agency that Musk has repeatedly claimed without evidence is a “criminal organization.”

On Thursday Musk took to the stage with Argentinian president Javier Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he held up a chainsaw - replicating a previous stunt by Milei to represent the cuts he planned to government spending.

Trump and Musk have been accused of playing into [Russia](/topic/russia)
’s heavily distorted narrative of its invasion of the country. Because none of this is having a positive effect on Ukraine.”

Indeed, Russian leaders have praised the White House, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying that Trump “[understands our position](/news/world/americas/trump-russia-zelensky-ukraine-war-blame-b2701773.html)
.”

“A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.’ If you'd told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud,” former Russian president [](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE)

 on X. Bankrupt clown…”

Ukrainian and international leaders expressed their support for Zelensky after the claims from Trump and Musk, and argued the White House is playing into Putin’s hands.

“We may like Zelensky, or we may not. His political opponents are routinely jailed or even killed, such as Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov.

Others took issue with Musk’s intention to change Community Notes, a popular fact-checking feature.

“The entire point of the community notes system is that it's independent of the personal views of the people running this platform,” Shayan Sardarizadeh, from the BBC’s Verify team, [wrote](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1892632200333394395)
 on X. “If you start tampering with the system because you personally dislike some notes, then how could users continue to trust it?”

_The Independent_ has contacted X for comment.

Musk, who has long framed himself as a champion of online free speech, has touted Community Notes as an effective tool to maintain factual discourse on X without resorting to top-down speech guidelines.

“Community Notes aims to help all people better understand issues discussed in posts, including people who may hold different viewpoints,” the company’s website reads. unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.”

Experts, including those at the sociology institute, have found that Zelensky has greater than majority support, with a recent survey finding that 57 percent of Ukrainians trusted the president.

Keith Darden, an American University professor who studies Ukraine, [told](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trump-falsely-claims-zelensky-has-a-4-approval-rating-its-above-50/index.html)
 CNN the private institute is considered “the best and most reliable survey organization in Ukraine,” and its findings are quoted in U.S. and Ukrainian media.

![Video Player Placeholder](/img/logo-white-out.svg)

Professor Olga Onuch of The University of Manchester, who regularly conducts survey work in Ukraine, including alongside the sociology institute, has said Trump and Musk’s claims do not reflect the leader’s current support in Ukraine.

“Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic – Zelensky remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine,” she [said](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/trump-is-making-false-claims-about-zelenskys-popularity/)
 in an interview with the university’s website."

* * *

Elon Musk has pledged to "fix" X's fact-checking tool in response to opinion polling that contradicts US President Donald Trump's claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump's attacks on Zelensky on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform's "community notes" feature was being "gamed" by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while reposting an anonymous right-wing X account that cast doubt on the credibility of a Ukrainian polling outfit over its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who is one of Trump's most powerful allies as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X's community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

! He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he cancelled the election," Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelensky's approval to be just 4%.

"In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election," Musk said, referring to Zelensky's decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow's 2022 invasion.

"I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this. Musk vowed to fix the community notes feature on the platform."

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, September 30, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 130 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding: 57 in North Carolina, 29 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities and media reports compiled by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Widespread havoc
----------------

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday. "And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

BERLIN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - There must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday at the start of the Munich Security Conference.

"A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing," Baerbock said in a statement. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on assets of four individuals whom it linked to Mexico-based Cartel del Noreste, including the popular hip-hop artist El Makabelico.

From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire): 
Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

[US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete Hegseth\

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – video

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

, held a highly contentious bilateral meeting televised live in the [Oval Office](/wiki/Oval_Office "Oval Office")
 at the [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")
 in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. Trump subsequently criticized him on his social media platform, [Truth Social](/wiki/Truth_Social "Truth Social")
, where he accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy a "dictator" for not holding elections – even though the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during [martial law](/wiki/Martial_law_in_Ukraine "Martial law in Ukraine")
, which was in effect in Ukraine at the time.[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)
 The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a European-backed [General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
 [resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-11/7 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/7")
 on February 24, 2025, to condemn Russia and demand a withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

The Trump administration initially intended to cancel Zelenskyy's trip to Washington one week beforehand but was persuaded by French president [Emmanuel Macron](/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron")
 to proceed with it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)
 The administration urged Ukraine to agree to share revenue from its raw minerals with the United States,[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)

 The idea for the agreement was originally proposed by Ukraine to the Biden administration in 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-woda25-30)

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/urbaniulian/posts/10227566798023994)
 claims Germany threatened to cut ties with the United States.

**Verdict: Misleading**

Baerbock did not threaten to cut relations with the United States.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States. One user wrote, “AFP:

German Foreign Minister Baerbock threatens to cut diplomatic ties with US over Ukraine: ‘We will increase pressure on the US to make it clear that they have a lot to lose if they stop supporting Europe’s liberal democracies.'”

This claim is misleading. That is why I will support Ukraine as long as it needs it, because it is our peace.”

Germany has not threatened to cut off relations with the U.S, according to [Misbar](https://www.misbar.com/en/factcheck/2025/02/23/germany-has-not-threatened-cut-ties-us-after-talks-russia)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine (<image:1007>). A Wikipedia article mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" and called on European countries to "defend the rules-based international order" (<image:i>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-peace-over-heads-ukrainians-europeans-says-german-foreign-minister-2025-02-14/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-peace-over-heads-ukrainians-europeans-says-german-foreign-minister-2025-02-14/), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire), and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in February 2025, Annalena Baerbock made statements regarding the situation in Ukraine, including comments on a potential ceasefire and the need to protect Ukraine's interests. The evidence also shows that Baerbock criticized Donald Trump's conduct, referring to it as a "new era of ruthlessness."

However, the provided evidence does not mention Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available information.

To verify the claim, information about whether Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US is missing.

**German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says European allies should put more pressure on US President Donald Trump's administration in order to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine.**             

Baerbock said on Friday that in order to keep the US as a partner, rather than an opponent allied with Russia, Europe must put pressure on Trump’s administration.

"We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" in order to show them that "they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe," said Baerbock.

Baerbock warned about the new bilateral talks between Russia and the US that took place earlier this week without the presence of Europeans, which aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.

She claimed that Ukraine and by extension Europe could be forced to make painful concessions in a ceasefire agreement.

According to Baerbock, any ceasefire negation without the participation of Europe or Ukraine is "a peace that is not peace but the opposite, further preparation for even more war and violence."

She emphasized that the ceasefire negotiations must take place with the participation of Ukraine and its allies.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday held a phone call conversation, during which the two leaders spoke about "ways to achieve a just peace in Ukraine" as Washington pushed for talks with Moscow without involving Ukraine or Europe.

**Trump increases attacks on Zelensky**

US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Zelensky on Friday.

Trump’s relentless criticism comes amid a wider policy shift on the conflict from the US that included a bilateral meeting with Russia about a ceasefire deal.

In an interview with Fox Radio, he blamed the Ukrainian leader for the start of the war and its continuation.

He also said Zelensky was negotiating for a ceasefire agreement without having any military or political advantage over Russia.

“He’s been at meetings for three years, and he got nothing, so I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest,” said Trump.

Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Friday that he believed Ukraine would soon sign a deal that would grant Washington access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in exchange for continued support in the war.

!German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock addresses journalists during the 61st Munich Security Conference (MSC). Sven Hoppe/dpa

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday that she believes European allies should put more pressure on US President Donald Trump's administration to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine.

"We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" to show "that they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe," Baerbock said during an election campaign event in the city of Potsdam, just outside Berlin.

Three years ago when Russia first invaded Ukraine, the German government had proclaimed a "turning point," she said, referring to a much quoted speech by Chancellor Olaf Scholz promising more defence spending.

"Now we need a second turning point" Baerbock said, "no more dithering and wavering for our peace."

The Green politician sounded the alarm over new bilateral talks between Russia and the United States launched earlier this week, amid fears that Ukraine could be forced to make painful concessions in a ceasefire deal.

"A sham peace - that is, a peace that is not peace, but blackmail or a surrender is not peace, but the opposite: further preparation for even more war and violence," said Baerbock. Sven Hoppe/dpa <image:2245>

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock addresses journalists during the 61st Munich Security Conference (MSC). "That is why I will support Ukraine as long as it needs it, because it is our peace."

"No one can decide on war and peace over the heads of the Ukrainians or us Europeans – and that is the clear German position," Germany's top diplomat said.

Content: "President Donald Trump appears not to have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his impending bombshell peace plan for Ukraine, despite Germany’s crucial role in supplying arms and aid to Kyiv.

Scholz spoke to POLITICO on Wednesday, only hours before the Trump administration’s shock announcement that it would conduct peace negotiations over the head of European leaders, effectively ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia and insisting that Europe should provide the lion’s share of military and financial aid.

In his conversation with Berlin Playbook, Scholz said he had been receiving indications from Trump and his advisers that Washington would not perform such a dramatic U-turn on support for Kyiv.

“The talks that I have had with \[Trump\] and that my advisers have also had with his advisers lead to the conclusion that we can hope and assume that the U.S. troops involved in any peacekeeping operation.

The German chancellery has not yet responded to a request for comment relating to the latest developments.

On the question of whether Germany would send troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, Scholz suggested there would be no solution without U.S. is involved, because transatlantic unity must always be guaranteed,” Scholz said when asked whether Gemany would send troops as part of any potential peacekeeping operation.

The fact that the chancellor of the EU’s biggest economy appeared to be unaware of Washington’s plans suggests Scholz’s expectation for transatlantic unity was misguided.

Germany is second only to the U.S. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.

In Munich, Vance is also [scheduled](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-and-germanys-likely-next-chancellor-set-to-talk-ukraine-trade/)
 to meet Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in what will be the first high-level meeting between a member of Trump’s second administration and the German conservatives — who are in pole position to lead the country’s next government after the Feb. 23 parliamentary election.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, meanwhile, criticized Trump’s stance on negotiations with Moscow, lamenting that his administration had “made public concessions to Putin before talks even began.”

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss issues like Ukraine’s potential NATO membership or territorial losses at the negotiating table — not beforehand,” the politician from Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

_Chris Lunday contributed reporting._ will continue to support Ukraine,” Scholz told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook podcast hours before Trump effectively called time on its support for Kyiv as it resists Russia’s invasion.

Later on Wednesday, Trump announced he would begin immediate negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while U.S. “This is the basis for creating the prospect of a peaceful solution that is not a dictated peace over Ukraine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO and said Europe “must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.”

Hegseth also warned his counterparts at a NATO meeting in Brussels that Ukraine would not be able to take back all the territory Russia had seized, and said there would be no U.S. The country has also hosted around 1.2 million Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion almost three years ago.

“We have supported Ukraine over all these years,” Scholz said. in providing military support for Ukraine."

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Scholz rejects ‘dictated peace’ for Ukraine as Europe reels after Trump-Putin call
==================================================================================

Europe

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday said a deal to end the Ukraine war should not be imposed on Kyiv as European leaders warned of security implications on the continent after US President Donald Trump agreed to open negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call.

European leaders scrambled on Thursday to try to get a seat at the table in [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 peace talks after US President [Donald Trump](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/donald-trump/)
 announced the start of negotiations after speaking directly to Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vladimir-putin/)
 in a phone call.

Trump’s move sent shockwaves through European capitals, which want a central role in peace talks because any settlement in Ukraine, hit by a full-scale Russian invasion three years ago, will have ramifications for their own security.

German Chancellor [Olaf Scholz](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/olaf-scholz/)
 warned that the Ukraine conflict must not end with an “dictated peace”.

"The next task is to ensure that there is no dictated peace," Scholz said in an interview with Politico.

[NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 Secretary General [Mark Rutte](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mark-rutte/)
 stressed that [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 must be involved in peace talks and any final deal to end Moscow's war on Kyiv needs to be "enduring".

"Of course, this is crucial – (when) we talk about Ukraine, that Ukraine is closely involved in everything happening about Ukraine," Rutte told journalists ahead of a [NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 meeting defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday.

'Crucial moment of truth'
-------------------------

French Defence Minister [Sébastien Lecornu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/sébastien-lecornu/)
 on Thursday warned that NATO faces a moment of reckoning as the US and Russia set in motion negotiations to end the Ukraine war.

"It's a crucial moment of truth," said Lecornu. Peace, this has unfortunately been the experience over centuries, can only be secured from a position of strength," he added.

Their comments came the morning after Trump took the world by surprise when he announced that the US and Russia had agreed to "have our respective teams start negotiations immediately" on Ukraine during a phone conversation between Trump and Putin.

Following Trump's revelations, the foreign ministers of [France](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/)
, Germany and Spain insisted that any peace deal in Ukraine could not be achieved without the involvement of Kyiv and its European partners.

"There will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans," French Foreign Minister [Jean-Noël Barrot](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jean-noël-barrot/)
 told a foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, while his German and Spanish counterparts added that no decisions could be taken without Ukraine.

Trump's peace push 'not a betrayal', says Hegseth
-------------------------------------------------

US defence chief Pete Hegseth however told reporters on Thursday that Trump's peace plan was "not a betrayal" of Ukraine.

"There is no betrayal there. That's historically true – but the question is, will it still be true 10 or 15 years from now."

His German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, said it was "regrettable" that the Trump's administration had made "concessions" to Russia before peace talks on Ukraine had even started. 

"In my view it would have been better to speak about a possible NATO membership for Ukraine or possible losses of territory at the negotiating table," Pistorius said ahead of the NATO meeting. 

Russia would be remain a threat to Europe's security even if an agreement for peace in Ukraine can be reached, Pistorius added.

"It would be naive to believe that this threat, even after any peace agreement whenever it materialises, would in fact subside," he said.

"That's why we have to invest faster and more in our defence and security capabilities. And so that will require both sides recognising things they don't want to," said Hegseth.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels before the start of Thursday's NATO meeting, Hegseth said it was Europe's responsibility to stop the Russian "war machine".

Hegseth repeated his call for increased defence spending by NATO countries, which he said should ultimately reach 5% of gross domestic product.

The US defence chief told European counterparts on Wednesday that Ukraine's dream of returning to its pre-2014 borders was an "illusionary goal" – and that Kyiv's wish for NATO membership was "not realistic".

Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson on Thursday said Ukraine could still become a NATO member in the future if it fulfils all conditions to join the military alliance.

"I don't foresee the NATO membership as such being off the table for Ukraine," Jonson said before attending the NATO meeting.

'Peace in Europe is at stake'
-----------------------------

German Foreign Minister [Annalena Baerbock](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/annalena-baerbock/)
 on Thursday reiterated the message that Ukraine and Europe need to be involved in [peace talks](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/peace-talks/)
 about Ukraine.

"We can't have talks without involving Ukraine. This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality," said Baerbock, a member of the Greens party.

UK Defence Secretary John Healey echoed Baerbock's comments, insisting that Ukraine and Europe should participate in negotiations with Russia to bring an end to the conflict.

“Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” said Healey."

CNN  — 

President Donald Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday morning.

The call, which is the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.

Trump administration officials said they hoped [a prisoner “exchange”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/index.html)
 on Tuesday could portend renewed efforts to end the war, which is about to enter its fourth year.

Now, as the two leaders resume communication after a long period of silence between the White House and Kremlin, the contours of Trump’s settlement plan are coming into clearer focus.

In a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump said, “We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.”

“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,” Trump wrote.

Both Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.

“President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, ‘COMMON SENSE.’ We both believe very strongly in it,” Trump wrote, suggesting the former KGB agent on the other end of the line had chosen his words carefully to appeal to the US leader.

The Kremlin said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly 90 minutes.

Trump had been signaling for weeks his desire to speak with Putin as he works to resolve the Ukraine conflict.

As American officials travel in Europe this week, they have begun taking clearer positions on how the conclusion of the Ukraine war might look. Speaking to a conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing US borders and deterring war with China.

Meanwhile, Trump has spoken of striking a deal with Ukraine’s Zelensky for American access to the country’s valuable rare earth minerals as payment for continued American assistance.

Trump spoke with Zelensky midday, shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.

His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal.

The last US president to visit Russia was Barack Obama in 2013, when he attended a G20 summit. Putin last visited in the United States in 2015 to attend United Nations talks.

Later on Wednesday, Trump indicated that he could soon meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia but cautioned that no formal decision has been made on the matter.

“We think we’re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,” Trump said, hours after the two spoke by phone.

The president indicated that Saudi Arabian leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions, saying, “We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be.”

A date for that meeting, Trump said, “hasn’t been set,” but he said it could be in the “not too distant future.”

Trump added he has not yet committed to go to Ukraine.

Asked whether Zelensky would be in attendance when he meets with Putin, Trump appeared to suggest he would not be present for the initial meeting: “Probably we’ll have a first meeting and then we’ll see what we can do about the second meeting.”

“I would think about going, I’d think about it, no problem,” he said.

Steve Witkoff, who will be among Trump’s top negotiators on the conflict, pointed earlier Wednesday to the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel as “an indication of what the possibilities are” for the future of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“I think that’s maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future, and what that may portend for the world at large, for conflict and so forth.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV, Feb 12 (Reuters) - [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)
 said both Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin/)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the [war in Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

The conversations came after Trump's defense secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the NATO military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signaling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.

After speaking with Putin for more than an hour, Trump said the Russian leader, who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wants the war to end and they discussed "getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future."

"He wants it to end. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, oversaw billions of dollars of military and other aid to Kyiv and had no direct contact with Putin after Russia's invasion.

Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal.

'ILLUSIONARY GOAL'
------------------

Earlier on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered the new administration's bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying Kyiv could not realistically hope to return to [previous borders](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 or join NATO.

"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.

Zelenskiy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.

Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a member of Trump's cabinet, said such a mineral deal could serve as a ["security shield"](/markets/commodities/top-trump-official-kyiv-discuss-deal-minerals-energy-2025-02-12/)
 for Ukraine after the war.

Trump also said Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will hold talks about the war on Friday in Munich, where Ukrainian officials were expected to attend an annual security conference.

The new diplomacy followed a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap that got under way on Tuesday, which the Kremlin said could help build trust between the two countries.

Russia on Tuesday freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence in a Russian prison, [in exchange](/world/europe/russia-says-its-getting-back-prisoner-us-return-freeing-teacher-marc-fogel-2025-02-12/)
 for a Russian cybercrime boss imprisoned in the U.S., according to a official.

Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.

The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow. Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.

In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.

Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.

"I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. He speaks fluent Russian.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. According to Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)), Trump stated that they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and ordered U.S. officials to start talks. The Wikipedia article also supports this.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that an agreement to end the war was reached, only that discussions and the beginning of negotiations were agreed upon.

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)) also reported that Trump spoke with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and ordered U.S. officials to start talks <image:4759>.

The Wikipedia article "February 2025 Putin–Trump phone call" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call)) discusses the phone conversation and mentions that Trump shared details and agreed to begin peace talks.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. According to Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)), Trump stated that they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and ordered U.S. officials to start talks. The Wikipedia article also supports this.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that an agreement to end the war was reached, only that discussions and the beginning of negotiations were agreed upon.

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 Eventually, the [Ukrainian Defence Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Ukraine) "Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)")
 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)
[\[b\]](#cite_note-"memory1-15)

According to the [Armed Forces of Ukraine](/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine "Armed Forces of Ukraine")
, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, the provided sources offer different figures for February 2025. One source indicates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing as of February 26, 2025. Another source mentions that by early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously missing were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

The Mediazona article, with its last update from February 24, 2025, provides an estimate of losses as of December 2024, but does not specify the exact number. Therefore, the claim of 1.5 million troop losses as of February 2025 is not directly supported by the provided evidence, although the total casualties could be close to that number.

To fully verify the claim, more specific data on the total number of Russian troop losses, including killed, wounded, missing, and captured, as of February 2025, would be needed.

**The Issue**
-------------

_Russian military forces have failed to effectively advance along multiple axes in Ukraine, seized limited territory, lost substantial quantities of equipment relative to Ukraine, and suffered remarkably high rates of fatalities and casualties since January 2024, according to new CSIS data. Overall, a high of 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, a sign of Putin’s blatant disregard for his soldiers. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars _combined_ between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While Putin may have hoped that Russia’s military would quickly defeat Ukrainian forces and topple the government in February 2022, it failed to do so.

Since early 2024, Russia has held the initiative in the war in Ukraine.13 As used here, “initiative” involves attacking—or threatening to attack—an enemy to force it to react or deny it the ability to act. For each case, the measured distance is divided by the number of days of the campaign to calculate the average rate of advance in meters per day.

Along the Donetsk front in the east, Russia launched a renewed offensive in October 2023 and captured the fortified city of Avdiivka in February 2024 after one of the war’s most intense battles.26 From that point through April 2025, Russian forces advanced approximately 60 kilometers westward toward the city of Pokrovsk—an average of just 135 meters per day.

Russia’s progress has been even slower near Kharkiv in the north. <image:4822>](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-06/250603_Jones_Battlefield_Woes_Fig3d.jpg?VersionId=OQLKrhs9OgGt7KHCiiEvPceOTOiOzL9O)

The slow pace of Russia’s recent advances is part of a broader pattern that has defined the war in Ukraine. No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate.

Remote Visualization

In addition, over 950,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and wounded since the war began.36 As Figure 8 highlights, Russia’s daily average of casualties has increased _every year_ since 2022. Putin likely considers these types of soldiers more expendable and less likely to undermine his domestic political support base.37

Ukrainian fatality rates are also high at between 60,000 and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed, with a total of 400,000 casualties (which include both killed and wounded).38

The new evidence from a CSIS article published on June 3, 2025, states that there were over 950,000 total Russian casualties between February 2022 and May 2025, with approximately 250,000 fatalities. This information contradicts the claim that Russia had lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war."

## Actions
```
web_search("Russia Ukraine war troop losses February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the Ukraine war, with an additional 48,000 missing (<image:k>). A Wikipedia article notes that a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, and that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously missing were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provided an estimate of Russian losses, with the last update from February 24, 2025, estimating losses as of December 2024. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2–3%.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, the provided sources offer different figures for February 2025. One source indicates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing as of February 26, 2025. Another source mentions that by early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously missing were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

The Mediazona article, with its last update from February 24, 2025, provides an estimate of losses as of December 2024, but does not specify the exact number. Therefore, the claim of 1.5 million troop losses as of February 2025 is not directly supported by the provided evidence, although the total casualties could be close to that number.

To fully verify the claim, more specific data on the total number of Russian troop losses, including killed, wounded, missing, and captured, as of February 2025, would be needed.

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

"There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence,” he said.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources discuss committee assignments but do not mention any blocking or reasons for assignment decisions. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Thune blocked Schiff's assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)

## Actions

web_search("John Thune Adam Schiff committee assignments")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress, mentioning that Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee and that Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced the committee assignments. <image:2574> and <image:1> The document from torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with Adam Schiff (D-CA) assigned to several committees and John Thune (R-SD) assigned to others; it does not mention any blocking of committee assignments. The document from hklaw.com lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress, with Adam Schiff (CA) on the House Committee on the Judiciary and John Thune (SD) on several Senate committees.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources discuss committee assignments but do not mention any blocking or reasons for assignment decisions. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Thune blocked Schiff's assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

# Your Analysis

From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8):

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources discuss committee assignments but do not mention any blocking or reasons for assignment decisions. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Thune blocked Schiff's assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

President Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America’s deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal.

The shift comes as the Pentagon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade.

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Economic opportunity is meanwhile not a major factor in the cooperation among the four countries, in each of which the state plays a strong role in the economy.

Cooperation Between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia: Current and Potential Future Threats to America
=========================================================================================================

Each one of these states threatens U.S. To make matters worse, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are increasing their support for one another. How likely is this scenario?

This paper examines the state of cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and identifies paths that could lead to their closer cooperation—and paths that would not. A concluding section draws policy implications.

### **Cooperation in Pairs So Far**

Although China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are now often viewed as an aligned group, cooperation among them has been almost entirely bilateral so far. Security Council resolution banning the practice.29 A few years ago, Pyongyang was estimated to receive $500 million annually this way, which it spends on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.30 China also illicitly facilitates the export of millions of barrels of oil to North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers.31

While China’s support lessens the economic pressure that international sanctions put on Pyongyang, China’s security commitment is essential for it.32 Beijing also defends North Korea in international forums, vetoing resolutions that would tighten sanctions, and sometimes introducing measures to loosen them.33

There are limits, however, to cooperation in this dyad. For example, China has to date refused to provide North Korea with nuclear-weapons technology and expertise, and it has supported some sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s nuclear program.34 Some analysts even concluded that North Korea carried out its ballistic missile test close to Japan in 2022 to demonstrate that it had the long-range capacity to strike areas of value to Beijing.35

Mostly, China must manage the risk of disaster in North Korea."

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that in March 2024, President Joe Biden approved a classified nuclear strategic plan to prepare the United States for potential nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat)). This supports the claim that Biden ordered preparations for possible nuclear confrontations with these countries.

The evidence also highlights the ongoing cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea, with North Korea providing munitions to Russia in exchange for food ([https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/cooperation-between-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-current-and-potential-future-threats-to-america?lang=en](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/cooperation-between-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-current-and-potential-future-threats-to-america?lang=en)). This context suggests a potential for increased tensions and the need for strategic planning.
