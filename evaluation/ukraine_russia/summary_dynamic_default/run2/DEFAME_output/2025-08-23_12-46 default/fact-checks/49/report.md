## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) discuss Zelensky's meeting with US President Joe Biden and the visit to the plant.

The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)) article focuses on the political implications of the visit. None of the articles mention Israeli bombs or Gaza. ![image 954](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504302-187821.jpg) ![image 960](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504308-548113.jpg) ![image 963](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504311-967303.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania. The ammunition was not identified as Israeli bombs, nor was it stated that they were intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)) do not support the claim.
