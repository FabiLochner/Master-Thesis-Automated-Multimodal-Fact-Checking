**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade was a showcase of military equipment, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration that started on August 14.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia. The evidence confirms a parade took place on August 15, 2024, and the celebrations started on August 14. The evidence does not mention the parade being a preparation for war with Russia.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event but lacks evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) reported on Poland's military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of the annual Armed Forces Day observances in Warsaw. The parade showcased Poland's growing army and modern equipment. The Polish Radio website ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)) also reported on the parade, which took place on August 15, 2024, as part of a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17. The parade included military hardware, such as K2 battle tanks, Krab self-propelled gun-howitzers, and M1A1 Abrams tanks.

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland))) discusses Armed Forces Day in Poland, celebrated annually on August 15th, commemorating the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia. The day is marked by military parades and equipment reviews. <image:25>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade was a showcase of military equipment, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration that started on August 14.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia. The evidence confirms a parade took place on August 15, 2024, and the celebrations started on August 14. The evidence does not mention the parade being a preparation for war with Russia.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event but lacks evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**A Message from The Moscow Times:**

Dear readers,

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

 By the end of the first week, the Ukrainian military said it had captured 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi) of Russian territory, while Russian authorities acknowledged that Ukraine had captured 28 settlements.[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:4578>!Getty Images A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk <image:4579>Getty Images

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.

Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."
