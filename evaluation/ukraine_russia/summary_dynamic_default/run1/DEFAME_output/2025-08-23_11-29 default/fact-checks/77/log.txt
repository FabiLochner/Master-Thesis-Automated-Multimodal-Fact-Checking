Justification: The image depicts a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations, which began on August 14, as reported by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) and Polish Radio ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)). While the claim correctly identifies the event as a military parade, there is no evidence to support the assertion that it was a preparation for war with Russia.
