## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von in August 2024. One source from the University of California, Berkeley ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)) discusses a video with AI-generated audio of Trump criticizing Keir Starmer, overlaid on the interview. The original interview did not include discussion of the UK or Ukraine.

Additional sources mention the interview with Theo Von ([https://ca.news.yahoo.com/theo-von-113629526.html](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/theo-von-113629526.html)) and that Von's interview with Trump made the president "the most human that Iâ€™ve actually seen him" ([https://uk.news.yahoo.com/podcast-bro-theo-von-questions-224125941.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/podcast-bro-theo-von-questions-224125941.html)). ![image 4357](media/2025-08-23_11-47-1755949623-906978.jpg), ![image 4358](media/2025-08-23_11-47-1755949626-668196.jpg), ![image 4359](media/2025-08-23_11-47-1755949630-891360.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von in August 2024. However, the original interview did not include any discussion of the UK or Ukraine. A video circulating online contains AI-generated audio of Trump criticizing Keir Starmer, which was overlaid on the interview.

Therefore, the claim that Trump criticized Keir Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine in the interview is false.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm the interview between Donald Trump and Theo Von in August 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the original interview did not include any discussion of the UK or Ukraine. The claim is based on a video with AI-generated audio, making the claim inaccurate.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von in August 2024, the original interview did not include any discussion of the UK or Ukraine. A video with AI-generated audio was created to make it appear as though Trump criticized Keir Starmer, as reported by the University of California, Berkeley ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)).
