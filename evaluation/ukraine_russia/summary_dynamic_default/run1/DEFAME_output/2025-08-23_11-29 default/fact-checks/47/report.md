## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin (![image 14](media/47.jpg)) is fake. Myth Detector ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) and without-lie.info ([Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)) both confirm the image is fabricated. The article from aol.com ([Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)) also states that the image is fake and that a Charlie Hebdo journalist confirmed it.

The fabricated cover was dated March 20, 2025, with the serial number 1705, while the real cover was published on March 19, 2025. The image was shared on Facebook.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the claim is false. Multiple sources, including Myth Detector, without-lie.info, and aol.com, identify the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Zelenskyy in a coffin as fabricated.

The fabricated cover's date and serial number (March 20, 2025, No. 1705) are incorrect. The real cover was published on March 19, 2025. The image was shared on Facebook.
