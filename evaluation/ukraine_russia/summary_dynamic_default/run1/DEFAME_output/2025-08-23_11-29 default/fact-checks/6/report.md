### Evidence from `web_search`
Defense News reported on August 29, 2024, that an F-16 jet crashed in Ukraine during a Russian attack, killing the pilot. The article mentions that some F-16s have been used to intercept Russian missiles. ([https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/08/29/ukraine-f-16-jet-crashes-during-russian-attack-killing-pilot/](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/08/29/ukraine-f-16-jet-crashes-during-russian-attack-killing-pilot/)) ![image 2853](media/2025-08-21_17-06-1755796012-682439.jpg), ![image 2852](media/2025-08-21_17-06-1755796010-799958.jpg)

The War Zone discusses claims of a Ukrainian F-16 shooting down a Russian Su-35S Flanker. It mentions a Ukrainian F-16 pilot, Oleksiy Mes, who died in August 2024 after shooting down Russian cruise missiles and a drone. ([https://www.twz.com/air/claims-swirl-around-russian-su-35s-flanker-shootdown](https://www.twz.com/air/claims-swirl-around-russian-su-35s-flanker-shootdown)) ![image 2865](media/2025-08-21_17-07-1755796037-802497.jpg), ![image 2862](media/2025-08-21_17-07-1755796029-084173.jpg) The Guardian published an article on August 28, 2024, discussing the Ukraine war, mentioning that Volodymyr Zelenskiy said F-16s were used to shoot down Russian missiles. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles)) ![image 2868](media/2025-08-21_17-07-1755796054-854177.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that F-16s were involved in the conflict in Ukraine in August 2024. One F-16 crashed during a Russian attack, and Ukrainian F-16s were used to intercept Russian missiles. However, the image provided shows a MiG-29, not an F-16.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a MiG-29, not an F-16. While F-16s were involved in the conflict in Ukraine in August 2024, the image does not depict an F-16. The claim is therefore inaccurate.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While F-16s were involved in the conflict in Ukraine in August 2024, as reported by [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/08/29/ukraine-f-16-jet-crashes-during-russian-attack-killing-pilot/) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles), the image depicts a MiG-29, not an F-16.
