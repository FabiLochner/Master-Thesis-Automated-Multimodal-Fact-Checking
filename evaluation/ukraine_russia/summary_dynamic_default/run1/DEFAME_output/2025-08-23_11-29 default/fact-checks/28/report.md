## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in March 2025, Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump. The letter criticized Trump's behavior toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The claim is partially supported but also contains information that is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025 criticizing his behavior toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Since the claim is partially supported but also contains information that is not supported by the evidence, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.
