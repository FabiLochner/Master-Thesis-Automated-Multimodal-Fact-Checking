The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence does not support the claim. While John Thune had a role in releasing GOP Senate committee assignments, there is no evidence to suggest he blocked Adam Schiff's assignments. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Schiff was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy, not Thune.

So, the overall veracity is: false
