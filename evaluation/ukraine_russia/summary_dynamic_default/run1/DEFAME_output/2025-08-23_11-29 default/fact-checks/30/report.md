## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters published an article on August 22, 2025, discussing the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, mentioning President Trump's threat to impose sanctions on Russia if a peaceful settlement is not reached. The article also mentions a meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska on August 15, 2025, and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have not yet agreed on a meeting agenda (<image:k>). CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg)).

The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Trump's involvement in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House (![image 4181](media/2025-08-23_11-39-1755949190-359650.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that as of August 2025, a peace deal had not been reached. The Reuters article from August 22, 2025, discusses ongoing war and the threat of sanctions to encourage a settlement. Furthermore, the evidence mentions meetings and talks, but no agreement.

The evidence indicates that there were ongoing efforts to reach a peace deal, but it does not confirm that a deal was reached in early 2025.


## Final Judgement
The search results from August 2025 indicate that while there were discussions and meetings related to a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, no deal had been reached by that time. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but they do not confirm the existence of a peace deal in early 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence from August 2025, including articles from Reuters and The Guardian, indicates that while peace talks were ongoing, no peace deal between Ukraine and Russia had been reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but do not confirm the existence of a peace deal.
