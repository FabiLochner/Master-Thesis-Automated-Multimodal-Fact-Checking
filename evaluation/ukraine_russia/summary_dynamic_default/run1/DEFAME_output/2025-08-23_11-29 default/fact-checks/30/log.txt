Content: The Reuters article, published on August 22, 2025, discusses the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. It mentions that President Trump threatened to impose sanctions on Russia if there is no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine. The article also mentions a meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska on August 15, 2025, where they discussed the war. The article also mentions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have not yet agreed on a meeting agenda. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl): 
Content: CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia. <image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>. The article mentions that Donald Trump is pushing for a peace deal, while Ukraine wants a ceasefire. The article also states that any peace deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be illegal under the UN Charter.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Trump's involvement in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. The article mentions a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House <image:4181>. The article states that Trump intends to host a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy only after they have met first.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence from August 2025, including articles from Reuters and The Guardian, indicates that while peace talks were ongoing, no peace deal between Ukraine and Russia had been reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but do not confirm the existence of a peace deal.

So, the overall veracity is: false
