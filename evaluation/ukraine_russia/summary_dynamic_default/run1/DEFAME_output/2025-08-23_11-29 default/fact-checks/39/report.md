KVUE.com also reported on the murder of Jamie White ([https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/jamie-white-murder-arrests-infowars/269-aa20c169-085c-4827-8e8c-ce8755a4b715](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/jamie-white-murder-arrests-infowars/269-aa20c169-085c-4827-8e8c-ce8755a4b715)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, as reported by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html) and [latintimes.com](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436). White had posted on social media that he was on a "Ukrainian 'Enemies List.'" The Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack. Alex Jones has spread misinformation about the killing.

StopFake.org states that White was murdered on March 9, and his sister and local police believe his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The article claims that White was not on any "list of enemies of Ukraine" and that the screenshot he posted of the alleged "list" does not match the Myrotvorets website. ![image 4222](media/2025-08-23_11-42-1755949323-006652.jpg) The article also mentions that White frequently spread disinformation and anti-Ukrainian conspiracy theories. ![image 4199](media/2025-08-23_11-41-1755949306-666042.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Jamie White, an InfoWars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025. However, the claim that it was revealed he was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is disputed. While White claimed to be on such a list, and Alex Jones spread misinformation about the killing, the Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack. Furthermore, StopFake.org states that White was not on any "list of enemies of Ukraine" and that the screenshot he posted of the alleged "list" does not match the Myrotvorets website.


## Final Judgement
The claim that it was revealed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not supported by the evidence. While White claimed to be on such a list, and Alex Jones spread misinformation about the killing, the Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that White was not on any "list of enemies of Ukraine."

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that it was revealed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not supported. While White claimed to be on such a list, and Alex Jones spread misinformation, the Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack, and evidence suggests White was not on any such list ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html), [https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)).
