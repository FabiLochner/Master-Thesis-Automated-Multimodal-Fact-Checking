Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html): 
Content: The New York Times reports that Jamie White, an Infowars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas. White had posted on social media that he was on a "Ukrainian 'Enemies List.'" Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack. Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, has spread misinformation about the killing. The article was published on March 12, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436): 
Content: The search result from latintimes.com discusses the death of Infowars reporter Jamie White in Austin, Texas. It mentions that White believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The article also includes a statement from Austin police and a quote from Alex Jones. <image:4199>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/): 
Content: The search result from StopFake.org states that Jamie White was murdered in Austin on March 9, and his sister and local police believe his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The article claims that White was not on any "list of enemies of Ukraine" and that the screenshot he posted of the alleged "list" does not match the Myrotvorets website. <image:4222> The article also mentions that White frequently spread disinformation and anti-Ukrainian conspiracy theories.

The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that it was revealed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not supported. While White claimed to be on such a list, and Alex Jones spread misinformation, the Austin police believe the shooting was a random attack, and evidence suggests White was not on any such list ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html), [https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
