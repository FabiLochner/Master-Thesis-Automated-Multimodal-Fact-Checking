## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy met at the White House on February 28, 2025. The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations on February 24, 2025, and the meeting was contentious. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

NPR reported that Zelenskyy's visit to the White House on February 28, 2025, ended abruptly after a spat in the Oval Office. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg) Al Jazeera reported on a "shouting match" between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, 2025, but the article does not contain the quote in the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy and Trump met at the White House on February 28, 2025, and that the meeting was contentious, with reports of a "spat" and a "shouting match." However, none of the provided sources mention Zelenskyy making the specific statement attributed to him in the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the claim about Zelenskyy's statement is related to a dispute between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House. According to a DW.com fact-check, the quote is taken out of context from a speech Zelenskyy gave on February 24, 2023, and the Associated Press published a fact check article stating that Zelenskyy did not say that Americans will have to send their "sons and daughters" to war in Ukraine. ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118), [https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159)) <image:i>

An ABS-CBN article also discusses disinformation following a row between Trump and Zelenskyy. ([https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/world/2025/3/7/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row-0826](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/world/2025/3/7/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row-0826)) ![image 4184](media/2025-08-23_11-41-1755949275-288905.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that the quote attributed to Zelenskyy is likely false. Fact-check articles from DW.com and the Associated Press state that Zelenskyy did not make the statement. The quote appears to be taken out of context from a speech given in 2023.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. While Zelenskyy and Trump did have a contentious meeting, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy is not accurate. Fact-checks from reliable sources like DW.com and the Associated Press confirm that Zelenskyy did not make the statement. The quote appears to be taken out of context from a speech given in 2023. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump occurred at the White House in February 2025, and was reportedly contentious, the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy was not made during that meeting. Fact-checks from sources like [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159) confirm that Zelenskyy did not make the statement, and it appears to be taken out of context from a 2023 speech.
