Useful result: From [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/is-putin-battling-a-string-of-deadly-diseases-zelenskyy-says-he-will-die-soon-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/119819574.cms):

The article also mentions rumors about Putin's health, including cancer and Parkinson's disease, and the alleged use of body doubles. The article was published on April 2, 2025.

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: While reports from sources like Newsweek, The Economic Times, and India Today indicate that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's motorcade was involved in an incident, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. Furthermore, although there are speculations about Putin's health and potential death, as discussed in the Wikipedia article "Claims of Vladimir Putin's incapacity and death" and Legion Magazine, these are not confirmed. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
