**US philanthropist Howard Buffett has kept up funding Ukraine with informal arrangements, even amidst deteriorating relations between the two nations since President Donald Trump’s election into office.** 

The son of billionaire Warren Buffett and longtime Republican Party supporter made his 18th visit to Ukraine in three years via a train trip in April, underscoring his funding support. 

Buffett told the Associated Press that Trump’s apparent closeness with Russia and clampdown on military support for Ukraine has not altered his foundation’s support in Ukraine. 

‘It doesn’t change anything we do. Howard Buffett maintains Ukraine philanthropy despite deteriorating US support 
===============================================================================

! We’re on track,’ he said. 

Howard Buffett’s foundation aims to surpass the $1 billion giving mark this year for Ukraine. 

So far, the Buffett Foundation has provided $800 million in aid and funding towards clearing mines and boosting agriculture and local infrastructure. A similar trip is expected in May. 

In a video posted by the Associated Press, Buffett was joined by Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The pair have established close relations, with Svyrydenko describing Buffett as ‘one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.’ 

Buffett also scorned the possibility of a peace deal, calling it ‘impossible’ given Trump’s pivoting towards the Kremlin and Putin’s reluctance. 

“At the end of the day, I think the US will do the right thing, but it may be a painful process and there may be a lot more Ukrainians that die,” he said.

Ukraine’s agricultural sector has lost 20.5 per cent of farmland since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.  

And some 139,000 square kilometres of land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined. Two-thirds of that is fertile farmland belonging to Ukrainian farmers who have sowed wheat for generations. 

The foundation also funded bipartisan trips for US lawmakers to visit Ukraine in 2023."

 As uncertainty in U.S.–Ukraine relations grows, informal ties with some U.S. Buffett, a Republican and son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. We’re on track,” Buffett told The Associated Press, adding that his foundation will surpass $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. So, we’ll stick with it as long as we need to.”

The AP caught up with Buffett aboard a train with Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko on Saturday. Svyrydenko calls him “one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.”

Buffett is [among a number of Americans](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-be08b99bf75e99de991557ac18c7bf15)
 across the U.S. hasn’t done enough to help Ukraine defeat Russia over the past few years.

On this trip, Buffett and Svyrydenko traveled to the country’s northern Sumy region, where the situation has significantly worsened following Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in Russia’s Kursk region.

They visited the villages of Popivka and Bobryk, which — like much of the region — lie in a high-risk zone for land mines. They also stopped at a local school that had been relocated to a basement, where children now study during hours-long air raid alerts.

Buffett’s foundation, which focuses on humanitarian needs like agriculture, infrastructure and mine clearance, has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, including $175 million in humanitarian demining. Svyrydenko’s ministry is responsible for Ukraine’s humanitarian demining infrastructure.

“He understands very well that if a country that can feed 400 million people cannot clear its fields and loses at least $12 billion of GDP every year due to mined land, it’s a major challenge,” Svyrydenko said of Buffett.

According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy, the country’s [agricultural sector](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-africa-lifestyle-middle-east-1b41faaa7ac0984d0673023b68d39a70)
 has lost 20.5% of its farmland since the invasion — due to land mines, occupation and ongoing fighting.

Roughly 139,000 square kilometers (53,670 square miles) of Ukrainian land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined."

Warren Buffett's son Howard has given $500M to Ukraine — he warns the US is making a historic mistake by pulling its support
============================================================================================================================

By [Rebecca Rommen](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/rebecca-rommen)

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett in Kyiv, Ukraine. Log in.

*   Business Insider interviewed Warren Buffett's son about his  support for Ukraine. 
*   Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million to Ukraine in humanitarian aid.
*   The philanthropist warns the US will make a historic blunder if it fails to support Ukraine's war effort.

Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the embattled nation needs its friends more than ever.

Russia celebrated [a landmark victory](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-troops-pull-out-key-eastern-town-avdiivka-russia-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 when it captured the eastern town of Avdiivka last week, and it is [running low on artillery ammunition.](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-ammo-problems-hinder-ability-fire-at-russian-targets-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 Meanwhile, a $60 billion military aid package is snarled up in Congress due to opposition from some Republican Party lawmakers.

But Howard Buffett, the elder son of Warren, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, has no intention of forsaking Ukraine or its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The wartime leader and American philanthropist have a profound mutual respect.

Buffett told Business Insider, "There are very few people in the world that could step up" and do what Zelenskyy's done. And it's going to be one of the biggest mistakes that the United States makes historically if we don't continue to support Ukraine.

"The most frustrating part is to watch the narrative in the US because you have congressmen and senators whose constituencies or districts are benefiting from this war," he said.

Putting his money where his mouth is, Buffett said another $300 million is budgeted for Ukraine this year, and for the last two years, the foundation exceeded the budgeted number.

The foundation is largely funded by his father, Warren Buffett's contributions. [Warren Buffett is the seventh richest person](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?embedded-checkout=true)
 in the world, boasting a net worth of $138 billion.

'You have to step up big'
-------------------------

In December, [Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett visited a Kyiv plaza](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-i-govard-baffet-vidkrili-na-aleyi-smiliv-87821)
 adorned with plaques honoring Ukraine's most steadfast supporters during Russia's full-scale invasion to show the US philanthropist that his name is also etched on the "Walk of the Brave."

Zelenskyy told Buffett: "You are among these world leaders — friends of Ukraine."

Buffett calls the war the "largest humanitarian crisis" that he's witnessed in his lifetime.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Buffett Foundation has emerged as a stalwart ally to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion, injecting $521,779,225 into humanitarian assistance for Ukraine as of January 2024.

The US and its 'Ukraine fatigue' problem
----------------------------------------

"The guy's got to be worn out," Buffett said of Zelenskyy. So to me, he's somebody who has stepped up and done a job that I think very few people could do," said Buffett.

"I don't think anybody could have done a better job," he said, observing that "it's an incredible force that he's up against."

While Buffett worries about Zelenskyy's exhausting schedule and sleepless nights, he is also concerned about "Ukraine fatigue" affecting its most important ally, the United States.

He warned against it last year and continues stressing the importance of supporting the war effort.

Nate Vance, who describes himself as a "Republican-leaning independent" and had been generally supportive of the Trump administration on other issues, said he found his cousin's stance on Ukraine deeply misguided.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:2-11)

One of the most notable statements Nate Vance made was calling his cousin and Trump "_Vladimir Putin's useful idiots._" In an interview with _Le Figaro_, he argued that by halting or reducing support for Ukraine, his cousin and Trump were effectively doing Putin's bidding under the false hope of appeasing the Russian leader. ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-newsweek.com_17-0)

Content: "And speaking of which, why is Elon Musk in the Oval Office wearing a baseball hat and a T-shirt all the time?"

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)
.

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

JD Vance's cousin criticises him for 'belittling' Zelensky

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)

 to Kyiv.

[Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has eschewed suits for military-style dress in what he says is solidarity with soldiers.

"Everyone knows that's why he does that and it's kind of a symbolic thing," Nate Vance said."

Pandora Papers reporting
------------------------

In 2021, following the release of the [Pandora Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/global-investigation-tax-havens-offshore/)
, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a global network of investigative journalists, [reported](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle)
 that Zelenskyy and several business partners had owned a "network of offshore companies."

Zelenskyy largely removed himself from the network in connection with becoming president in 2019, according to the [report](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle#:~:text=The%20documents%20also%20show%20that%20just,that%20now%20belongs%20to%20his%20wife.)
, gifting shares in offshore companies to his wife or business partners.

It was unclear from the report how much money was held in the offshore companies.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, faced criticism from Donald Trump and JD Vance during a tense White House meeting. While Brian Glenn, Chief White House Correspondent at Real America’s Voice, donning a blue suit himself, tried to ‘embarrass’ Zelenskyy by asking him whether he owned a suit or not, the Ukranian president gave it back to him by saying, "I will wear a (suit) costume after this war finishes, yes. 

Who is Volodymyr Zelenskyy? 

------------------------------

  
Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician and former entertainer who has served as the sixth and current president of Ukraine since 2019, most notably during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022. 
As per Forbes’ estimate, Zelensky’s entire real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, including two more wholly owned apartments, two that he co-owned, a single commercial property, and five parking spaces. 'Fight On Your Own...'

  
Meanwhile, on Monday, President Donald Trump ordered a 'pause' on US military aid to Ukraine after a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into peace negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy, known for his calm demeanor despite the confrontation, ultimately left without securing a crucial minerals deal. The Ukrainian president was at the White House for a meeting with US President [Donald Trump](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/donald-trump)
, which ended in an ‘unprecedented disaster’ after Trump, along with his VP, JD Vance, engaged in a ‘shouting match’ all the while ‘berating’ Zelenskyy. 
First, it was about Zelenskyy’s outfit (he wore a black sweater – the same color and cut he has donned every time he’s appeared in droopy military fatigues) that was questioned by an American reporter."

[The Pandora Papers](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers)

Investigation

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rode to power on pledges to clean up the Eastern European country, but the Pandora Papers reveal he and his close circle were the beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies, including some that owned expensive London property.

Banner: James O’Brien/OCCRP

Key Findings

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize.
*   Zelensky’s current chief aide, Serhiy Shefir, as well as the head of the country’s Security Service, were part of the offshore network.
*   Offshore companies were used by Shefir and another business partner to buy pricey London real estate.
*   Around the time of his 2019 election, Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Shefir, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore.

Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers reveal that Sri Lankan-Irish businessman Anura Perera, named by the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission as a suspect in the Anglo Leasing procurement scandal, was the owner, director or signatory of at least six offshore firms implicated in the case. In general offshore companies are bad, whether they’re owned by a president or not,” Ryaboshapka said.

He called moving money offshore “an old tradition” in Ukraine, because the country was perceived as a dangerous place with “no rule of law.” But still, the use of such companies today raises red flags of “tax evasion or the legalization of dirty money,” he said.

“That’s the essence of offshore companies.”

Actor Volodymyr Zelensky stormed to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019 on a wave of public anger against the country’s political class, including previous leaders who used secret companies to stash their wealth overseas.

Now, leaked documents prove that Zelensky and his inner circle have had their own network of offshore companies. The show starred Zelensky as a humble history teacher whose anti-corruption rant in class is filmed by a student, goes viral online, and wins him national office.

In a case of life imitating art, Zelensky ended up winning the real-world Ukrainian presidency just three-and-a-half years after the show’s launch, with more than 73 percent of the vote.

Zelensky capitalized on widespread public anger at corruption, but his 2019 campaign was dogged by doubts over his anti-graft bona fides, given that his campaign was boosted by media belonging to Kolomoisky — who is [accused of stealing US$5.5 billion](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/oligarchs-weaponized-cyprus-eranch-of-ukraines-largest-bank-to-send-5-billion-abroad)
 from his own bank and funneling it offshore in concert with his partner, Hennadiy Boholiubov.

In the heat of the campaign, a political ally of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko published a chart on Facebook purporting to show that Zelensky and his television production partners were beneficiaries of a web of offshore firms that allegedly received $41 million in funds from Kolomoisky’s Privatbank.

That ally, Volodymyr Ariev, didn’t provide evidence, and his accusations have never been proven. But the Pandora Papers show that at least some of the details in this alleged scheme correspond to reality. / Alamy Stock Photo\

Serhiy Shefir (right) and Volodymyr Zelensky (left) at Zelensky’s presidential campaign headquarters in 2019.

Serhiy Shefir’s brother Borys, who is a part-owner of Maltex Multicapital Corp, said he may indeed be an owner, but was unaware of the details of the offshore arrangement, which was largely the work of Ukraine’s now-Security Service chief, Bakanov.

“Bakanov was our financial director, he set up the financial schemes of our company. Zelensky has not mentioned Maltex in any of his public asset declarations, including one filed for 2018, when he still owned 25 percent of the company.

In such an arrangement, “the real owner has placed another person to act as his or her proxy to pretend to be the shareholder,” Woods said.

“The person making the transfer wants to retain the shares and the benefit of the shares, but doesn’t want other people to know that that is the situation."

In response to questions sent by Pandora Papers reporters, Fidelity confirmed it was the registered agent for Maltex Multicapital Corp, but it said that Zelensky was not currently an owner or beneficiary of any company under its administration.

“The present Ukrainian president is not our client, nor does he have any ownership or any other position in any entity under our administration,” Fidelity said.

The company also argued that there would have been nothing wrong to have worked for Zelensky prior to his ascent to political office in 2019. The chart showed money flowing from the bank via a series of apparent shell entities to companies alleged to have been owned by Zelensky and associates.

Ariev has not provided documentation to back up his claims.

However, the Pandora Papers documents do provide the first corroboration for elements of his allegation: that 10 of the companies that allegedly received the money really did belong to Zelensky and his partners. The financial flows that are visible from the documents appear to be connected to their television production business, of which Kolomoisky was a client.

The leaked documents show the offshore network was set up by individuals behind Kvartal 95 in 2012, the same year in which local media reported that Kvartal 95 entered into a production deal with Kolomoisky’s 1+1 Group.

The Pandora Papers show that SVT Films Ltd, a company that was as of May 2013 half-owned by the BVI holding company Maltex, was to be paid $1.2 million in licensing fees by January 2013 by an offshore company linked to Kolomoisky’s 1+1 network for the television program “Make a Comedian Laugh.”

In 2015, a company called Gimentiano Holdings Ltd, which was ultimately owned by Zelensky’s friend Andriy Iakovlev, also received $750,000 into its account at the Cyprus branch of Kolomoisky’s Privatbank."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

How Did Zelenskyy’s and Ivanishvili’s Wealth Change During the Russia-Ukraine War?

On February 20, during the broadcast of “New Paradigm,” host Tengo Omanadze spoke about the increase in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wealth during the Russia-Ukraine war \[[52:40](https://www.facebook.com/100064835944683/videos/1031699295465330)\
\]. According to Zelenskyy’s financial declarations, his income decreased after the war began, and his family’s financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. Moreover, according to Forbes and Bloomberg, Ivanishvili’s wealth has increased compared to the beginning of the war.**

*   #### **Did Zelenskyy’s Income Increase or Decrease After the War Began?**
    

Before entering politics, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a successful actor and producer, accumulating his wealth while working in the entertainment industry before becoming president. Thus, the increase in Zelenskyy’s family income compared to the previous year was linked to the resumption of rental payments.

Regarding savings, financial declarations show that the family’s cash reserves have gradually decreased. By the end of 2022, their savings had dropped by approximately 1.8 million hryvnias, and by the end of 2023, they had [decreased](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-publishes-declaration-unveiling-more-than-317-000-of-income-for-his-family-in-2023/)
 by another 2.8 million hryvnias (about $71,000).

It is notable that Zelenskyy’s financial situation has not changed significantly since becoming president. According to the latest available Forbes data from 2022, his net worth is [less](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/false-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-s-net-worth-is-over-500-million?u)
 than $30 million. While this is a substantial amount, it is not surprising in the case of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he was a successful actor and producer.

The real estate owned by Zelenskyy and his family has remained practically unchanged during his presidency. Myth Detector has published multiple reports debunking such claims:

*   #### **How Did Ivanishvili’s Wealth Change During the Russia-Ukraine War?**
    

[According](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/bidzina-ivanishvili/)
 to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Bidzina Ivanishvili’s wealth is estimated at $7.60 billion \[March 5, 2025\], ranking him 406th on the list."

As the war in Ukraine rages on, rumors abound online regarding Zelenskyy’s net worth, including assets such as homes and vehicles. The site says that the president’s financial disclosure from 2018 listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias, Ukrainian currency. He graduated from Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics with a law degree, but never practiced, according to ClutchPoints.

Thanks for signing up.

Thank you for signing up. Some news sources speculate that tweets declaring the former comedian’s net worth at $1.5 billion were efforts to undermine support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine.

### So how much is Zelenskyy really worth?

According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million — not $1.5 billion. At the time, that gave him a net worth of $1.5 million USD, although, due to foreign exchange rates, the amount fluctuates.

Zelenskyy earned most of his money as a Ukrainian entertainer, starring in Russian-language films including “Love in the Big City,” “Office Romance,” and “8 First Dates.” The tri-lingual president, who is fluent in Russian, Ukrainian, and English, also dubbed the Ukrainian voiceovers for “Paddington”and “Paddington 2.”

From 2015 to 2019, he starred in a political satire comedy series, “Servant of the People.” The oddly prophetic show, which aired for 51 episodes, chronicled the adventures of a high school teacher turned president of Ukraine. In 2019, Zelenskyy ran for office and was elected as president.

Although this marked Zelenskyy’s first foray into politics, he does have the education to back up his recent career change."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A Yahoo News fact-check from Snopes rates the claim as "False". Zelenskyy's asset declaration shows fewer than 15 properties, no planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000. There is no trace of a $35 million Florida mansion in Zelenskyy's name (<image:524>, <image:525>). The Times of India states that Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million and includes two wholly owned apartments, two co-owned apartments, a commercial property, and five parking spaces. The OCCRP revealed that Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore (<image:k>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. Multiple sources contradict the claim's assertions about Zelenskyy's assets and income. Snopes fact-check rates the claim as "False," citing Zelenskyy's asset declaration, which shows fewer than 15 properties, no planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000. There is no trace of a $35 million Florida mansion in Zelenskyy's name.

The Times of India states that Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million. AOL reports that Zelenskyy's monthly income is $930, and Celebrity Net Worth estimates his net worth at roughly $1.5 million. Forbes estimates Zelenskyy's net worth is less than $30 million.

### Evidence from `web_search`
A Yahoo News fact-check from Snopes rates the claim as "False". Zelenskyy's asset declaration shows fewer than 15 properties, no planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000. There is no trace of a $35 million Florida mansion in Zelenskyy's name (<image:524>, <image:525>).

 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

"I'm going to make a decision as to what we do and it's going to be, it's going to be a very important decision, and that's whether or not it's massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it's your fight," Trump said.

He said he was unhappy about Russia's [strike](/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-says-overnight-strikes-lay-bare-russias-intentions-war-2025-08-21/)
 on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured some of the facility's employees.

"I'm not happy about it, and I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, said on Friday that Russia was doing everything it could to prevent a meeting between him and Putin, while Russia's foreign minister said the agenda for such a meeting was not ready.

Zelenskiy has repeatedly called for Putin to meet him, saying it is the only way to negotiate an end to the war.

Trump had said he had begun the arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskiy meeting after a call with the Russian leader on Monday that followed their Alaska meeting on August 15.

Zelenskiy accused Russia of stalling.

"The meeting is one of the components of how to end the war," he said on Friday at a press conference in Kyiv with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. He said the guarantees ought to be similar to [NATO's Article 5](/world/europe/rutte-says-article-5-type-deal-considered-ukraine-nato-membership-not-discussed-2025-08-19/)
, which considers an attack on one member of the alliance as an attack against all.

Rutte said NATO allies and Ukraine are working together to ensure security guarantees are strong enough that Russia will never try to attack again.

"Robust security guarantees will be essential, and this is what we are now working on to define," he said.

(This story has been corrected to show that the strike on the factory was not deadly, it only involved injuries, and to clarify that it was an American factory, in paragraph 3)

*   Russia says agenda 'not ready' for Zelenskiy meeting
*   Trump brings back threat of sanctions
*   NATO's Rutte visits Kyiv ahead of Independence Day
*   Work on Ukraine's proposed security guarantees underway

WASHINGTON/KYIV, Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. "And since they don't want to end it, they will look for space to (avoid it)."

Russian Foreign Minister [Sergei Lavrov told NBC](/world/europe/russia-says-agenda-not-ready-all-putin-zelenskiy-summit-2025-08-22/)
 there was no agenda for such a summit.

"Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskiy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. He may be coming, and he may not, depending on what happens," Trump said.

Trump's comments did not address the fact that Russia was banned from international competitions such as the World Cup after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and has not taken part in qualification for the 2026 tournament, which will be hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

During a visit to a nuclear research center on Friday, Putin said Trump's leadership qualities would help restore U.S.-Russia relations.

"With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska," Putin said.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Russia launched in 2022. President Donald Trump on Monday.

US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-08-19-25)
 has ditched his call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, backing instead Russian President Vladimir Putin’s push for a permanent peace agreement. And my response to that is: That’s the point,” Pizzi said.

Ad Feedback But they understand that the kind of deal sought by Russia can’t happen unless the most basic principle underpinning the global order – that a country cannot get what it wants by force – is thrown under the bus.

And Kyiv’s European allies are not willing to risk that, not least because they could well become the next target of Russia’s aggression.

Speaking to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and several European leaders in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump adopted some of Moscow’s talking points, questioning whether a ceasefire was “necessary” if a broader peace deal could be achieved.

But international law experts and analysts say that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be completely illegal under the UN Charter, a key international agreement which most countries signed up to after the horrors of the Second World War.

While often thought of as essentially the same thing, there is a big difference between a peace deal and a ceasefire in the eyes of international law.

During a ceasefire, warring parties agree to stop fighting with each side keeping hold of the territory under its military control. So what that also (means) is that any treaty that you procure by use of force is effectively illegal and is inherently void,” said Jeremy Pizzi, an international lawyer and a legal adviser of Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation.

Little detail has been shared about the kind of peace deal Putin discussed with Trump last week, but it is clear that the Russian leader has not abandoned some of his maximalist demands, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, and is banned from joining NATO in the future.

This would make the deal doubly illegal under international law: illegal because of the way it would be reached – by force – and illegal because of its content.

But even if he wanted to – which he does not – Zelensky cannot agree to give up territory.

Under the Ukrainian constitution, any change to the country’s borders must be approved by a referendum – a rule that is in place partly because of Russia’s tendency to install puppet governments in foreign countries.

And, crucially, even if Kyiv were to recognize that the reality on the ground gives Russia the de-facto control of some of its land, it would certainly not agree to make this a permanent recognition. That has not stopped some [European leaders](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-ukraine-zelensky-russia-putin-08-18-25)
 from pushing for a temporary truce first, even though the US president has seemingly decided one is not necessary.

It’s not that [Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and its allies don’t want peace. But the understanding is that the pause is temporary – usually to provide a window to negotiate, deliver humanitarian help or evacuate civilians.

Kyiv and its European allies suggested that a ceasefire might be a precursor for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who attended the summit on Monday, said that he “can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire.”

A ceasefire can be short – like the 1914 Christmas Truce that lasted a few days – or it could stretch to decades. The prohibition of using armed force to conquer territory is absolute under international law,” Pizzi said.

No ‘sensible reason to trust Russia’
------------------------------------

There are also practical and strategic reasons why Ukraine cannot agree to Moscow’s demands.

The Russian military currently controls almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk, which means that Putin is asking Kyiv to give up even more than it has lost so far.

But the parts of the Donbas region that are still under Kyiv’s control include infrastructure that is crucial for Ukraine’s defense. If they were to be taken by Russia, the road to the western parts of the country would be wide open.

There is also little incentive for Kyiv to trust Moscow, Pizzi said.

“Russia has engaged in armed attacks against Ukraine for over 10 years now, consistently, repeatedly during that time. Russia has feigned negotiations, feigned good faith, while continuing to use violence and keeping up the same illegal maximalist goals in the background and Ukrainian authorities are painfully aware of this,” he said.

“There is no logical, sensible reason to trust Russia in the absence of a precursor, a good faith decision or engagement that they make on their part to hold off from killing more Ukrainians,” he added.

----------- So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

Trump steps back from Russia and Ukraine peace talks for now, sources say
=========================================================================

US president told top advisers trilateral meeting would take place after leaders of the two countries have met first

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Any US assistance is expected to come in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward."

The search results from August 2025 indicate that while there were discussions and meetings related to a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, no deal had been reached by that time. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but they do not confirm the existence of a peace deal in early 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`

The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Trump's involvement in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House (<image:4181>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that as of August 2025, a peace deal had not been reached. The Reuters article from August 22, 2025, discusses ongoing war and the threat of sanctions to encourage a settlement. Furthermore, the evidence mentions meetings and talks, but no agreement.

The evidence indicates that there were ongoing efforts to reach a peace deal, but it does not confirm that a deal was reached in early 2025.


## Final Judgement
The search results from August 2025 indicate that while there were discussions and meetings related to a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, no deal had been reached by that time. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but they do not confirm the existence of a peace deal in early 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence from August 2025, including articles from Reuters and The Guardian, indicates that while peace talks were ongoing, no peace deal between Ukraine and Russia had been reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing war, potential sanctions, and meetings between leaders, but do not confirm the existence of a peace deal.

WATCH: Harris meets with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy as Russia makes nuclear warning
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Sep 26, 2024 6:51 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — With American support for Ukraine at a partisan crossroads, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday slammed suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory for the sake of peace with Moscow as “dangerous and unacceptable.”

The Democratic presidential nominee spoke alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as she unleashed the veiled criticism of Republican candidate Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war.

**Watch Harris and Zelenskyy’s remarks in the player above.**

“They are not proposals for peace,” Harris said. “Where Trump goes off course, and where Biden and Harris have a much stronger argument, is that we get to that point not by throwing Ukraine under the bus but by giving them sufficient support so they can block further Russian aggression.”

_Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Michelle Price in New York and Ellen Knickmeyer, Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick, Kevin Freking, Steven Groves and Amelia Thomson-Deveaux in Washington contributed to this report._

 [Chris Megerian, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/chris-megerian-associated-press) assistance for Ukraine, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and faulted Zelenskyy for the ongoing bloodshed.

[**WATCH:** Trump suggests Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russian invasion during N.C. He rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on.”

Asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” and “we need peace.”

Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian leader asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.”

The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications, however benign their contents, was a reminder of the tension that’s been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy.

It was a far different impression than Harris delivered on Thursday as she embraced Ukraine’s defense and outlined a broader foreign policy vision rooted in “international order, rules and norms.” Harris rejected calls for the U.S. to walk away from its global role and warned that potential aggressors could be emboldened if Putin emerges victorious.

“The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it’s in our strategic interest,” Harris said.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to present the White House and Congress with his plans for reaching an endgame in the war by improving Ukraine’s chances on the battlefield and its eventual leverage at the negotiating table. has a responsibility to help Ukraine, compared with one third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in July.

Americans are also split on which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the war. [An AP-NORC poll from August](https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP-NORC-August-2024-President-Topline.pdf)
 found that about one-third of Americans said they trusted Harris more, while a similar share said the same about Trump.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy found some bipartisan support as he visited Capitol Hill, where he was greeted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sen. Jim Himes, another Connecticut Democrat and the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Zelenskyy wanted “more, faster.”

“He was politely frustrated,” Himes said, and specifically requested more Patriot missile defenses as Russia escalates strikes on Ukraine’s cities and energy grid before the winter.

Zelenskyy faces a much more tense situation with Trump. However, he said, Trump risks undermining Ukraine by enabling Putin to make more gains on the battlefield.

“Neither Ukraine nor Russia is going to win this war, and the sooner that the parties try to end this, the better,” Kupchan said. He’s pushing to lift restrictions on using long-range Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russian territory.

No movement on this issue was evident during Zelenskyy’s visit."

Harris, who has been associated with the Biden administration’s policies, [promised](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-kamala-harris-full-speech-at-the-2024-dnc)
 at the Democratic convention in August that she “will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”

Harris first met with Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference in 2022 a few days before the Russian invasion, warning the Ukrainian leader of the Kremlin’s impending attack and sharing American intelligence that suggested the invasion was imminent as Russian troops were poised to invade.

Ukraine and its war with Russia have become a central and controversial topic in the 2024 U.S. During the presidential debate with Harris in September, Trump declined to reveal whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia when he was asked, instead responding, “I want the war to stop,” and urging the two countries to negotiate a deal.

“What I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other, I’ll get them together,” Trump [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-russia-ukraine-2024/)
. Trump and Zelenskyy had a phone call in July, which the former president described as a “very good phone call.” He [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-friday-2024-07-19/)
 in a social media post after that call that when he is president, Ukraine and Russia “will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.” He has suggested that lifting the sanctions against Russia will be part of this deal.

Trump has criticized the Biden administration for sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. A Harris administration might well continue Biden’s policy of providing Ukraine with enough support so that it does not lose, but not with the wherewithal to win and eject Russia from Ukrainian territory.

**What is the outlook?**
------------------------

On the face of it, it appears that a future Harris administration’s policy toward Russia and Ukraine would represent continuity with that of the Biden administration. The brutal conflict, in which a [million people](https://www.wsj.com/world/one-million-are-now-dead-or-injured-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-b09d04e5)
 have been killed or severely injured, shows no signs of ending. President Joe Biden has said that [Ukraine must prevail](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-putin-will-not-prevail-war-with-ukraine-2024-09-13/)
 in this war and that Russia will not win. Donald Trump, who claims the war would not have broken out had he been president in 2022, says he [could end it 24 hours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893)
 after being elected, before his inauguration.

The issue for the American voter is whether the United States should continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes (as the White House now says) or whether it should pressure Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and end the war without having regained its full territorial integrity. national interest to pour so much money into supporting Ukraine and favor a rapid end to the conflict.

**Trump’s policies toward Russia and Ukraine during his presidency**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Russia and Ukraine featured prominently during Trump’s first presidency, as I have [written](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chaos-reconsidered/9780231556262)
 elsewhere."

"Live Now made an unintentional mistake Saturday evening during extensive live coverage of Easter services from around the world," a spokesperson said in response to a _Newsweek_ comment request. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. ET) on Saturday and midnight into Monday morning as part of an Easter truce resting on "humanitarian" concerns.

The announcement [was quickly met with skepticism from Kyiv officials](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-easter-truce-russia-ukraine-backlash-2061857)

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

"As of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)

For several hours, Fox News broadcast the ceremony in Moscow, where, alongside Putin, the city’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin was also present.

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, was featured on air with an address to Russians in which he called for the “unity of historical Rus’” and for “peace” that, according to him, should extend across the lands that received “grace in the baptismal font of Kyiv.”

At first, the video was labeled correctly: “Easter service: Kyiv, Ukraine.”

However, after a break in the broadcast, Fox News resumed the coverage with a caption that read: “Easter service: Kyiv, Russia.”

Evidence Showing Biden Did Not Board 'Empty Plane'

 published that The Independent's White House correspondent [Andrew Feinberg](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/andrew-feinberg)
 — who served as White House pool reporter at Joint Base Andrews — confirmed Biden boarded the plane to greet the people still onboard after the freed prisoners had deplaned. The caption clearly states Biden stepped onto the plane "to talk to the pilot who flew the former prisoners."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.

In short:
---------

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris welcomed the three Americans released in the prison swap as their plane touched down in Maryland. 

Mr Biden thanked the collective effort of the countries involved in the major international swap. 

What's next?
------------

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

US President Joe Biden has welcomed home the three Americans who were sentenced to years in Russian penal colonies after secret "sham" trials and now free under a major East-West prisoner swap. 

Mr Biden and Kamala Harris met the plane carrying detainees that landed in the United States on Thursday, local time, in Maryland. 

The president stressed the importance of diplomacy and praised the collective effort of Washington's allies in the multinational deal.

"Alliances make a difference," he said. 

"They stepped up, they took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.

"I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interest and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia," Mr Biden said. 

Vice-President Harris said it was "an extraordinary day".

"You can see it in the families, in their eyes and in their cries."

They were both serving sentences on spying charges that the US says were false.

Also released was Alsu Kurmasheva, a reporter for a US-funded radio network in Europe, who was last month jailed for six and a half years for "spreading false information" about the Russian military.

British-Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize winner who had written for the Washington Post, was also freed. He said Buenos Nochas."

Earlier on Thursday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the prisoner exchange, said that traitors to his country should rot and die in prison, but that it was more useful for Moscow to get its own people home.

"And let the traitors now feverishly adopt new names and actively disguise themselves under witness protection programmes," Mr Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

Six countries release at least one prisoner 
--------------------------------------------

Russia also received three men charged by federal authorities in the US, including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. 

Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being in a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges.

"Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world," Mr Biden said earlier.

All told, six countries released at least one prisoner.

The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the US to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offences. 

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing in a letter: "We know the US government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice."

Though she called for a change to the dynamic, "for now," she wrote, "we are celebrating the return of Evan."

The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The swap was coordinated by Türkiye, its intelligence agency said, and the American and German prisoners were taken to its capital, Ankara, before they were able to return home.

Eight Russians — who were being held in the US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia — were released too. I will see you again, we will talk about your future." 

On Friday, the Kremlin said Vadim Krasikov was an employee of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and had served in Alpha Group, the FSB's special forces unit.

Among those also released to Moscow was a Russian family, the Dultsevs and their two children, whom a court in Slovenia convicted of pretending to be Argentinians in order to spy on the EU and NATO member state.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the couple were "illegals" — deep-cover agents trained to impersonate foreigners, who spend years living abroad in their cover identities.

"The children of the 'illegal' intelligence agents who flew in yesterday only learnt that they were Russian after the plane took off (for Moscow) from Ankara," Mr Peskov told reporters.

"Before that, they didn't know that they were Russian and that they had anything to do with our country. And you probably saw that when the children came down the plane's steps that they don't speak Russian and that Putin greeted them in Spanish."

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) Biden’s national security adviser, had held back tears as he told reporters earlier in the day that a multicountry agreement, which released 24 prisoners from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia, had been a “vintage Joe Biden” act of statecraft.

As he took question after question from waiting reporters, Mr. The Russian American editor rushed into the arms of her sobbing daughter.

In the middle of the emotional scene that unfolded on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews late Thursday was President Biden. Biden had triumphantly announced that his administration’s diplomatic efforts had secured the release of three American prisoners held by Russia. Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva deplaned and were greeted by cheers, applause and family members.

“It feels wonderful,” Mr. Biden told reporters. Biden, they provided a seeming vindication of the type of patient, multilateral diplomacy that he proudly practices but that has so far proved unable to halt wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden seemed intent on reminding everyone what exactly that meant.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that Joe Biden was present when the freed Americans arrived in the U.S. in August 2024. The evidence also indicates that Biden boarded the plane. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when Biden boarded it. The Times of India article states that Biden entered an empty plane, but the Yahoo News article suggests that Biden boarded the plane to speak to the people who helped bring the freed prisoners home.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the exact reason for Biden boarding the plane is not entirely clear.

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

JD Vance criticised Fema's response to the hurricane at a rally in Butler on Saturday

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

! <image:4224>!Getty Images Destroyed houses and buildings along the Broad River in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Bat Cave, North Carolina <image:4229>Getty Images

Were any helicopters sent to help victims?
------------------------------------------

Trump said at the Butler rally that “Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina - no helicopters, no rescue - it’s just - what’s happened there is very bad.”

This is false.

White House blasts false claims about Hurricane Helene and relief aid
=====================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

Statement comes as president urges Congress to pass disaster-relief package as costs soar amid devastation

The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that [Hurricane Helene](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene)
 was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.

“We have seen a large increase in false information circulating online related to the federal response to Hurricane Helene,” a statement said, pointing to a “number of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort.”

The White House said the rumors, which include claims that emergency disaster money had been spent housing immigrants and that relief funds would be limited to $750 per claim, were “wrong, dangerous” and said “it must stop immediately”.

The warning, which speaks to the intense political environment Helene figuratively crashed into, came hours after Biden told lawmakers to refill the coffers of disaster relief programs as the projected recovery and rebuilding costs related to Hurricane Helene are estimated to be as much as $200bn over 10 years.

[In a letter sent to congressional leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/04/letter-to-congress-on-disaster-needs/)
, the president said while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Department of Defense are able to meet “critical life-saving and life-sustaining missions and will continue to do so within present funding levels”, they will need additional funding.

“My administration has provided robust and well-coordinated federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts,” Biden wrote.

“As with other catastrophic disasters, it will take some time to assess the full requirements for response and recovery efforts, and I fully expect that the Congress will do its part to provide the funding needed.”

Biden said that a comprehensive disaster relief package would be necessary when Congress returns on 12 November – but said action on individual programs could be needed before then. But there are currently no plans for Congress to reconvene before the election.

The request comes as Kamala Harris cut short a campaign swing through the western states to visit western North Carolina in the southern Appalachian mountains where entire towns were washed away.

Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas by air on Wednesday, and again in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. Administration officials [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/biden-warns-congress-disaster-funding-run-out/index.html)
 that the program needs $1.6bn in additional funding to meet about 3,000 Hurricane Helene-related applications it is receiving daily.

Last month, before Helene hit, the White House [warned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/H.R.-9747-Continuing-Appropriations-and-Extensions-Act-2025-Final-Updated.pdf)
 that the low funding levels could lead to the SBA “effectively ceasing operations” after paying out for weather-related costs and accidents, including the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the continued recovery after Maui’s wildfires and tornado damage in the midwest.

A storm-damaged area in the wake of Hurricane Helene in Florida on Thursday. He said the work to rebuild will cost “billions of dollars” and additional disaster relief funding “can’t wait … people need help now”.

At least 225 people have been confirmed dead from Helene, and officials say they expect the death toll to continue to rise as recovery efforts continue. A police department spokesperson in Asheville, North Carolina, [told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-satellite-images-north-carolina/)
 in an email late on Friday that it is “actively working 75 cases of missing persons”. Nearly 1 million people remain without power.

In his letter to lawmakers, Biden said that funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) “will run out of funding in a matter of weeks and well before the Congress is planning to reconvene”.

The SBA is designed to help small business owners and homeowners recoup property and equipment through the disaster relief loan program."

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

 the actual issue published on March 26.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/domenico.farina.31/posts/10223728579482001)
 claims to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that this image was created by the magazine. It is fake.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Zelenskyy in a coffin. **[(RELATED: Is Elon Musk Paying The Salaries Of The Rescued Astronauts For A ‘Full Year?’)](https://checkyourfact.com/2025/03/24/fact-check-musk-paying-salaries-rescued-astronauts-full-year/)

“The political corpse emits its last gas’: a new illustration by the French political magazine Charlie Hebdo. A wider search of the [magazine’s website](https://charliehebdo.fr/)

# Search Result
From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake."

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French."

## Actions
```
web_search("Charlie Hebdo March 20 2025 Zelenskyy coffin")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin (<image:14>) is fake. Myth Detector ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) and without-lie.info ([Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)) both confirm the image is fabricated. The article from aol.com ([Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)) also states that the image is fake and that a Charlie Hebdo journalist confirmed it.

The fabricated cover was dated March 20, 2025, with the serial number 1705, while the real cover was published on March 19, 2025. The image was shared on Facebook.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the claim is false. Multiple sources, including Myth Detector, without-lie.info, and aol.com, identify the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Zelenskyy in a coffin as fabricated.

The fabricated cover's date and serial number (March 20, 2025, No. 1705) are incorrect. The real cover was published on March 19, 2025. The image was shared on Facebook.

From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025): 
Content: "Russia has leveled some Ukrainian cities as it has attacked and occupied them, such as Mariupol.\[4\] Cities throughout the 80 percent of Ukraine that Russian forces have not occupied have remained largely intact during Russia's invasion, apart from deliberate Russian strikes against critical and civilian infrastructure.\[5\]

**Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections in wartime (unlike the US Constitution, which requires it).**

Ukraine's Constitution prevents the Ukrainian government from holding elections or amending the constitution in times of martial law.\[6\]

Russia triggered Ukraine's martial law provisions when it launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government cannot constitutionally suspend martial law while Russia continues to attack Ukraine.

Ukrainian opposition politicians, including those who have historically run against Zelensky, have stated that holding elections under martial law would be both illegal and immoral.\[7\]

**Ukraine has not suffered millions of losses.**

Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses by any reliable estimate, either in terms of civilian or military casualties.

Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion, and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action.\[8\]

US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000, but no reputable source places casualty estimates near or in the millions.\[9\]

The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024.\[10\]

**Europe provides about as much direct aid to Ukraine as the United States.**

Europe (including European Union \[EU\] members and EU institutions plus Norway and the UK) has overtaken the United States in terms of cumulative direct (military and non-military) aid allocations to Ukraine (not counting the costs of US forces forward-deployed in Eastern Europe).\[11\]

*   Europe has provided Ukraine with a total of $166 billion in cumulative aid and pledged an additional $34.7 billion to be allocated through 2030.\[12\]
*   Europe has provided and pledged approximately $204.1 billion in all — over $174 billion from the EU, $13.9 billion from Norway, and $16.2 billion from the UK — compared to America's $183 billion.\[13\]
*   These figures do not include the EU and G7 commitments to provide loans to Ukraine financed by income generated from frozen Russian assets.

**European loans to Ukraine are backed by income from frozen Russian assets, not Ukraine.**

The EU is contributing $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that are backed by extraordinary revenues from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not Ukraine.\[14\]

*   The EU holds approximately $220.5 billion in Russian frozen assets.\[15\]
*   The EU has already made available $1.6 billion for Ukraine from immobilized Russian assets and disbursed $3.2 billion in loans in January 2025.

**Ukraine did not misuse or lose half of the aid the United States has provided.**

The majority of the funds the United States has allocated for Ukraine stays in the United States to fund domestic defense industrial base and replenish US stockpiles.\[16\]

US government agencies closely oversee the remaining US aid, which is directly issued to Ukraine. <image:3606>**](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UKR%20support%20fact%20sheet%2C%20February%2021%2C%202025%20PDF%201.pdf)

**Zelensky does not imminently risk losing all of Ukraine.**

Russian forces currently occupy around 20 percent of Ukraine, leaving the remaining 80 percent of the country under Ukraine's sovereign control.

At the current rate of advance, it would take Russian forces over 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine, assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely.

Russia's rate of advance on the frontline has slowed significantly over the past three months.\[1\]

Russian forces are making small territorial gains at the cost of massive personnel losses.\[2\]

Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 27.94 square kilometers per day in November 2024, 18.1 square kilometers per day in December 2024, and 16.1 square kilometers per day in January 2025.\[3\]

**Most Ukrainian cities have not been destroyed.**

Many of Ukraine's largest cities, including Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa, have avoided destruction and continue to function. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Office of the Inspector General reported on January 11, 2024, that it had found no evidence of misappropriated aid.\[17\]

**Ukraine repeatedly invited Putin to negotiate in early 2022.**

Zelensky proposed to meet with Putin on February 19, 2022 — just five days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\[18\] Putin ignored this request and invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\[19\]

Zelensky called for direct talks with Putin "in any format" in March 2022 and offered to compromise on Ukraine's accession into NATO.\[20\] The Russians demanded the full surrender and demilitarization of Ukraine.\[21\]

Zelensky also expressed openness to discussing the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on the condition that the Ukrainian people would ratify any deal through a referendum.\[22\] Putin rejected that offer as well.

From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: "More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.

Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.

Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. Winning a war of attrition requires a willingness to absorb considerable casualties and significant losses of equipment.40 In Ukraine, Russia has some advantages in population size and industrial mobilization, particularly with the help of China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries.

### [Can Ukraine Fight Without U.S. While some policymakers and experts argue that Russia holds “all the cards” in the Ukraine war, the data suggests that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield._

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.”1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.”2 In addition, some U.S. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.”4 Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? Russia’s marginal gains are particularly noteworthy compared to its conquest of 120,000 square kilometers during the first five weeks of the war and Ukraine’s recapture of 50,000 square kilometers in the spring of 2022.

Third, Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment across the land, air, and sea domains, highlighting the sharp matériel toll of its attrition campaign. Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.

Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars _combined_ between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.6

Ukraine says Russia’s military losses have topped 1 million in 3 years of war
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jun 12, 2025 2:00 PM EDT

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The number of Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine has topped 1 million, military officials in Kyiv said Thursday, describing the huge price that Moscow has paid for its 3-year-old invasion.

The claim by the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, which came on a holiday celebrating Russia’s sovereignty, is in line with Western intelligence estimates.

President Vladimir Putin marked Russia Day by hosting a Kremlin meeting with soldiers decorated for their service in Ukraine, but neither he nor any other officials commented on the Ukrainian claim.

The U.K. Earlier this year, the General Staff of the Russian armed forces claimed that Ukrainian military losses had topped 1 million.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last spoke of Ukrainian military losses in February, when he said in an interview that 45,100 troops had been killed and about 390,000 injured.

The mutual claims of the other side’s losses couldn’t be independently verified.

### Russia launches more drone strikes

The casualty estimates came as Russian forces pummeled Ukraine with drones and other weapons, killing three people and injuring scores of others despite international pressure to accept a ceasefire.

According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia launched 63 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight. He previously reported three other injuries.

### Russia pushes its slow offensive in Ukraine’s east

The recent escalation in aerial attacks has come alongside a renewed Russian battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line.

While Russian missile and drone barrage have struck regions all across Ukraine, regions along the front line have faced daily Russian attacks with short-range exploding drones and glide bombs.

On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed its troops captured two more villages in the Donetsk region, Oleksiivka and Petrivske. During their June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely.

### Russia and Ukraine exchange more POWs

The only tangible outcome of the talks was an agreement to exchange prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers.

Russia and Ukraine conducted another POW swap on Thursday that included severely wounded and gravely ill captives, although the sides did not report the numbers.

“Our people are coming home,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram. 24, 2022.

On June 3, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said Russia likely would hit the mark of 1 million casualties this summer in what it called “a stunning and grisly milestone.”

Russia last reported its military casualties early in the war when it acknowledged that about 6,000 soldiers had been killed. One person was killed and 14 others were also injured in the southern Kherson region, which is partly occupied by Russian forces, police said.

The authorities in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said 18 people, including four children, were injured by Russian drone attacks overnight.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian drones targeted residential districts, educational facilities, kindergartens and other civilian infrastructure.

“Kharkiv is holding on. And that is the most important thing,” Terekhov said.

Russia has launched waves of drones and missiles in recent days, with a record bombardment of almost 500 drones on Monday and a wave of 315 drones and seven missiles overnight on Tuesday.

Ukraine responded to the Russian attacks with drone raids. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 52 Ukrainian drones early Thursday, including 41 over the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. The Ukrainian military had no immediate comment on the Russian claim.

The attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. This is already the second stage of returning those who are severely wounded and seriously ill.”

According to Ukraine’s Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, some of the repatriated soldiers had been listed as missing in action."

While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, and PBS News reported that Russian losses topped 1 million by June 2025 ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war)), the exact figure for February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

Donald Trump could use a 10 per cent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund [US security guarantees](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/19/what-security-guarantees-could-donald-trump-give-ukraine/)
 for Ukraine, his treasury secretary has said.

Scott Bessent revealed that the president had increased the price of US military hardware being [bought by European countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/06/russia-ukraine-deal-trump-zelensky-putin-war-latest-news/)
 for Ukraine by 10 per cent.

“We are selling arms to Europeans, who are then selling them on to the Ukrainians, and President Trump is taking 10 per cent mark-up on the arms,” Mr Bessent told Fox News. “So maybe that 10 per cent will cover the cost of the air cover.”

    ![Scott Bessent](/content/dam/briefs/2025/08/20/TELEMMGLPICT000436147463_17556979598970_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqnjwwg6uFgt_R7Jwk0HWLoHwSCF1R0VweJ7DS2UnVMSQ.jpeg?imwidth=350)

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he would be willing to use US air power to [support a European security force](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/17/ukraine-russia-war-latest-european-leaders-to-meet-trump/)
 in Ukraine as part of any settlement to end the war with Russia.

European nations have already pledged to buy at least $10bn in American-made military equipment for Kyiv in recent weeks.

Ukraine has also tabled a proposal that would see the country promise to buy a further [$90bn worth of hardware](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/19/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-trump-peace/)
 after its war with Russia comes to an end.

Mr Trump has insisted for some time that he will no longer spend US taxpayers’ money on supporting Ukraine, the defence of which he believes is a problem for European nations.

Nato military leaders hold summit
---------------------------------

Planning for a multinational force to be sent to Ukraine has been accelerated after the US president signalled he would be willing to contribute during talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, and European leaders.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the British chief of defence staff, was in Washington on Wednesday for talks with his US counterpart, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.

They joined a virtual meeting of Nato’s military leaders “as diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, an Italian admiral who heads the alliance’s military committee, said.

The plans being discussed would see a European force train and develop Ukraine’s armed forces, while securing its skies and seas. But he has ruled out putting American boots on the ground as part of assistance.

Meanwhile, the suggestion of a European peacekeeping force stationed in Ukraine has been met with veiled rejections from Moscow.

Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, warned that discussion of security guarantees without the Kremlin’s involvement was a “road to nowhere”.

Russia signals peace deal not close
-----------------------------------

Russia’s top diplomat suggested that any guarantees should be on the basis of Russian demands from initial peace talks in the spring of 2022, which [gave Moscow a veto](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/20/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-trump-peace/)
 over any military aid for Kyiv.

“We cannot agree with the fact that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation. This will not work,” said Mr Lavrov on Wednesday.

“I am sure that in the West, and above all in the United States, they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia – it’s a road to nowhere.”

This week, Moscow also issued a categorical rejection of “any scenarios involving the deployment of Nato troops in Ukraine”.

In a sign that a peace deal is not within reach, Mr Lavrov accused the European leaders who met Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky of carrying out “a fairly aggressive escalation of the situation, rather clumsy and, in general, unethical attempts to change the position of the Trump administration and the president of the United States personally”."

The illicit nature of banned weapons and the potential for weaponry theft and circulation on the black market raise genuine concerns about the security of arms sales to Ukraine. Facts or False Alarms: The State of Illicit Arms in Ukraine
===========================================================

19.Jun.2024 . Ukraine has historically had one of the largest [black markets](https://www.cato.org/blog/tragic-unsurprising-costs-loose-us-weapons-ukraine?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 for arms in Europe, with around 300,000 small arms and light weapons reported lost or stolen during the Russian invasion of Crimea between 2013 and 2015. This number is small compared to the estimated US$32 billion [lost](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 in Ukrainian military equipment stolen and sold on the black market between 1992 and 1998. These two problems, which continue to plague lawmakers in Washington, have been exacerbated by the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine.

### The Illegal Movement of Weapons

_Weaponry Theft in Ukraine: Reality or Russian Disinformation?_

The invasion of Ukraine has [led](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 to a larger quantity of weapons entering Europe, and thus a greater possibility for weapons to go missing. Since 2022, there have been sporadic [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/pentagon-watchdog-report-ukraine-weaponry/index.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 of small and large arms being stolen in Ukraine. Although it is difficult to confirm when and where weapons are stolen, the sheer scale of [weapon transfers](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 means that it is highly likely that some weapons will go missing over the course of the conflict.

However, when examining the extent to which illicit weapons are being used or sold in Ukraine, it is important to acknowledge the massive amount of Russian [disinformation](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4403926-pentagon-watchdog-ukraine-military-aid/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 about these weapons. Reports about Finnish gangsters, French rioters, Nigerian fighters, and Mexican cartels gaining weapons—like rifles and grenade launchers—from Ukraine have all been [debunked](https://riskbulletins.globalinitiative.net/ukr-obs-001/01-monitoring-illicit-arms-flows-from-the-conflict-in-ukraine.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 as Russian propaganda attempting to sway the United States and NATO allies to decrease arms transfers. The current US end-use monitoring program [focuses](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems and Anti-Tank/All-purpose Tactical Guided Missiles because of the classified information used to build those weapons. Contrarily, monitoring efforts have paid little attention to small arms and light weapons, yet those are the weapons more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations in Ukraine."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

.

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on March 10, 2025, that Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43%. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, with the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) being the main suppliers.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukrainian authorities have uncovered corruption schemes within the defense sector, involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices and kickbacks. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported on a scheme involving military drones and signal jamming systems, while Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) highlighted a scheme where participants received 30 percent of the contract amount. These revelations followed criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's actions regarding anti-corruption agencies.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

The sale of United States military equipment to foreign governments in 2024 surged 29 percent to a record $318.7bn, the US State Department said, a figure that includes the sale of jet fighters worth $18.8bn to Israel despite the country facing allegations of genocide in Gaza.

US weapons sales figures from the Biden administration’s final year were released on Friday, coming amid rising global instability and regional tensions.

Direct military sales by US companies rose to $200.8bn in fiscal 2024 up from $157.5bn in 2023, while sales arranged through the US government rose to $117.9 bn in 2024 over $80.9bn the prior year.

The State Department said in a statement that arms sales and transfers are viewed as “important US foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security”.

Sales approved in 2024 included but were not limited to $23bn in F-16 jets and aircraft upgrades to Turkiye’s military, $18.8bn worth of F-15 fighter jets to Israel, and $2.5bn in sales of M1A2 Abrams tanks to Romania.

The State Department said the US takes a “holistic approach” to arms sales and “weighs political, social, human rights, civilian protection” among many factors – including economic and military – when determining “the appropriate provision of military equipment” to allies and partners.

However, US investigative journalism organisation ProPublica has reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ignored explicit warnings about Israeli human rights violations amid the war on Gaza and continued to approve arms transfers to the country [in violation of US law](/news/2024/5/2/how-us-violates-its-own-leahy-law-to-ensure-military-support-for-israel)
.

More than 47,200 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, and images record the devastation [as entire cities within the enclave](/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza)
 have been turned to rubble using bombs, missiles, warplanes and other weaponry supplied by the US.

Human rights groups, UN experts and even former US government officials have accused the Biden administration of knowingly funding Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza.

In November 2024, Human Rights Watch released a detailed report outlining how Israel had engaged in [a deliberate effort](/news/2024/11/14/israels-forced-displacement-in-gaza-amounts-to-war-crime-hrw)
 to permanently prevent Palestinians from returning to large parts of Gaza.

US defence contractors are straining to meet the surge of demand for weapons that has mushroomed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ministries of defence globally have been lining up to submit orders to boost their inventories with US weapons, while the US is seeking to replenish its own stockpiles after weaponry and munitions were sent to Kyiv in support of its war with Russia.

A surge is also expected this year as orders approved in 2024 often go into the order backlog for US weapons makers, who are planning for a surge in demand for artillery rounds, Patriot missile interceptors and armoured vehicles.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukrainian authorities have uncovered corruption schemes within the defense sector, involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices and kickbacks. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported on a scheme involving military drones and signal jamming systems, while Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) highlighted a scheme where participants received 30 percent of the contract amount. These revelations followed criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's actions regarding anti-corruption agencies.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost billions in military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/20/trumps-10pc-markup-arms-sales-ukraine-security-guarantees/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/20/trumps-10pc-markup-arms-sales-ukraine-security-guarantees/)) reports that Donald Trump could use a 10 percent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund US security guarantees for Ukraine <image:0>, <image:1>. The Harvard International Review ([https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/)) states that Ukraine has historically had a large black market for arms and mentions reports of weapons being stolen in Ukraine since 2022.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43% ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The U.S. saw a 29% increase in arms sales to a record $318.7 billion in 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand)). The Washington Post reports that U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

The US-made M240 machine gun was offered for sale at US$8 000 and a Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher at US$6 000 – expensive, but a bargain for interested criminals, given the capabilities of such weapons. 

Elsewhere, there are signs that the arms trafficking market is becoming more organized, with larger stockpiles being assembled. ![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments."

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43% ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The U.S. saw a 29% increase in arms sales to a record $318.7 billion in 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand)). The Washington Post reports that U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

President Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America’s deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal.

The shift comes as the Pentagon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade.

The White House never announced that Mr. But the emerging partnership between Russia and China, and the conventional arms North Korea and Iran are providing to Russia for the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed Washington’s thinking.

Already, Russia and China are [conducting military exercises together](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/asia/china-russia-military-patrols.html)
. Xi’s ambitions was understood.

The Biden strategy sharpens that focus to reflect [the Pentagon’s estimates that](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/world/asia/china-nuclear-missiles.html)
 China’s nuclear force would expand to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, roughly the numbers that the United States and Russia now deploy. “And in particular,” he added, the weapons guidance accounted for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

In June, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, also [referred to the document](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/us/politics/us-nuclear-russia-china.html)
, the first to examine in detail whether the United States is prepared to respond to nuclear crises that break out simultaneously or sequentially, with a combination of nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.

The new strategy, Mr. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia [is aiding the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/asia/russia-korea-defense-asia.html)

The new document is a stark reminder that whoever is sworn in next Jan. Biden and his aides, looking at intercepts of conversations between senior Russian commanders, feared the [likelihood of nuclear use](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/us/politics/biden-nuclear-russia-ukraine.html)
 might rise to 50 percent or even higher.

Mr. Biden, along with leaders of Germany and Britain, got China and India to make public statements that there was no role for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the crisis abated, at least temporarily.

“It was an important moment,” Richard N."

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Cooperation Between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia: Current and Potential Future Threats to America
=========================================================================================================

Each one of these states threatens U.S. To make matters worse, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are increasing their support for one another. How likely is this scenario?

This paper examines the state of cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and identifies paths that could lead to their closer cooperation—and paths that would not. A concluding section draws policy implications.

### **Cooperation in Pairs So Far**

Although China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are now often viewed as an aligned group, cooperation among them has been almost entirely bilateral so far. Security Council resolution banning the practice.29 A few years ago, Pyongyang was estimated to receive $500 million annually this way, which it spends on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.30 China also illicitly facilitates the export of millions of barrels of oil to North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers.31

While China’s support lessens the economic pressure that international sanctions put on Pyongyang, China’s security commitment is essential for it.32 Beijing also defends North Korea in international forums, vetoing resolutions that would tighten sanctions, and sometimes introducing measures to loosen them.33

There are limits, however, to cooperation in this dyad. For example, China has to date refused to provide North Korea with nuclear-weapons technology and expertise, and it has supported some sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s nuclear program.34 Some analysts even concluded that North Korea carried out its ballistic missile test close to Japan in 2022 to demonstrate that it had the long-range capacity to strike areas of value to Beijing.35

Mostly, China must manage the risk of disaster in North Korea."
