## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Howard Buffett's foundation has provided significant aid to Ukraine. According to _Alliance_ magazine, the foundation aims to surpass $1 billion in giving this year, with $800 million already provided for mine clearing, agriculture, and infrastructure ([https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/)). Fortune reports that Howard G. Buffett is on track to donate $1 billion in aid this year, with approximately $800 million contributed since the full-scale invasion began (<image:k>) ([https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/)). Business Insider states that Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine (![image 508](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502221-865316.jpg)) ([https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has provided significant aid to Ukraine. Business Insider states that Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine ([https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine)). Other sources mention that the foundation aims to surpass $1 billion in giving this year, with $800 million already provided ([https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/)).

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate because it attributes the donations to Warren Buffett, while the evidence points to his son, Howard Buffett, and his foundation.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has donated over $500 million to Ukraine since 2022. Multiple sources, including Business Insider, Alliance magazine, and Fortune, provide evidence of Howard Buffett's philanthropic efforts.

The claim is demonstrably false because it misattributes the donations to Warren Buffett when the evidence clearly indicates that the donations were made by his son, Howard Buffett, and his foundation. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

Sources like _Business Insider_ ([https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine)) and _Alliance_ magazine ([https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/)) confirm this.
