Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

Donald Trump could use a 10 per cent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund [US security guarantees](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/19/what-security-guarantees-could-donald-trump-give-ukraine/)
 for Ukraine, his treasury secretary has said.

Scott Bessent revealed that the president had increased the price of US military hardware being [bought by European countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/06/russia-ukraine-deal-trump-zelensky-putin-war-latest-news/)
 for Ukraine by 10 per cent.

“We are selling arms to Europeans, who are then selling them on to the Ukrainians, and President Trump is taking 10 per cent mark-up on the arms,” Mr Bessent told Fox News. “So maybe that 10 per cent will cover the cost of the air cover.”

    ![Scott Bessent](/content/dam/briefs/2025/08/20/TELEMMGLPICT000436147463_17556979598970_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqnjwwg6uFgt_R7Jwk0HWLoHwSCF1R0VweJ7DS2UnVMSQ.jpeg?imwidth=350)

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he would be willing to use US air power to [support a European security force](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/17/ukraine-russia-war-latest-european-leaders-to-meet-trump/)
 in Ukraine as part of any settlement to end the war with Russia.

European nations have already pledged to buy at least $10bn in American-made military equipment for Kyiv in recent weeks.

Ukraine has also tabled a proposal that would see the country promise to buy a further [$90bn worth of hardware](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/19/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-trump-peace/)
 after its war with Russia comes to an end.

Mr Trump has insisted for some time that he will no longer spend US taxpayers’ money on supporting Ukraine, the defence of which he believes is a problem for European nations.

Nato military leaders hold summit
---------------------------------

Planning for a multinational force to be sent to Ukraine has been accelerated after the US president signalled he would be willing to contribute during talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, and European leaders.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the British chief of defence staff, was in Washington on Wednesday for talks with his US counterpart, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.

They joined a virtual meeting of Nato’s military leaders “as diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, an Italian admiral who heads the alliance’s military committee, said.

The plans being discussed would see a European force train and develop Ukraine’s armed forces, while securing its skies and seas. But he has ruled out putting American boots on the ground as part of assistance.

Meanwhile, the suggestion of a European peacekeeping force stationed in Ukraine has been met with veiled rejections from Moscow.

Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, warned that discussion of security guarantees without the Kremlin’s involvement was a “road to nowhere”.

Russia signals peace deal not close
-----------------------------------

Russia’s top diplomat suggested that any guarantees should be on the basis of Russian demands from initial peace talks in the spring of 2022, which [gave Moscow a veto](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/20/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-trump-peace/)
 over any military aid for Kyiv.

“We cannot agree with the fact that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation. This will not work,” said Mr Lavrov on Wednesday.

“I am sure that in the West, and above all in the United States, they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia – it’s a road to nowhere.”

This week, Moscow also issued a categorical rejection of “any scenarios involving the deployment of Nato troops in Ukraine”.

In a sign that a peace deal is not within reach, Mr Lavrov accused the European leaders who met Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky of carrying out “a fairly aggressive escalation of the situation, rather clumsy and, in general, unethical attempts to change the position of the Trump administration and the president of the United States personally”."

The illicit nature of banned weapons and the potential for weaponry theft and circulation on the black market raise genuine concerns about the security of arms sales to Ukraine. Facts or False Alarms: The State of Illicit Arms in Ukraine
===========================================================

19.Jun.2024 . Ukraine has historically had one of the largest [black markets](https://www.cato.org/blog/tragic-unsurprising-costs-loose-us-weapons-ukraine?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 for arms in Europe, with around 300,000 small arms and light weapons reported lost or stolen during the Russian invasion of Crimea between 2013 and 2015. This number is small compared to the estimated US$32 billion [lost](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 in Ukrainian military equipment stolen and sold on the black market between 1992 and 1998. These two problems, which continue to plague lawmakers in Washington, have been exacerbated by the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine.

### The Illegal Movement of Weapons

_Weaponry Theft in Ukraine: Reality or Russian Disinformation?_

The invasion of Ukraine has [led](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 to a larger quantity of weapons entering Europe, and thus a greater possibility for weapons to go missing. Since 2022, there have been sporadic [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/pentagon-watchdog-report-ukraine-weaponry/index.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 of small and large arms being stolen in Ukraine. Although it is difficult to confirm when and where weapons are stolen, the sheer scale of [weapon transfers](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 means that it is highly likely that some weapons will go missing over the course of the conflict.

However, when examining the extent to which illicit weapons are being used or sold in Ukraine, it is important to acknowledge the massive amount of Russian [disinformation](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4403926-pentagon-watchdog-ukraine-military-aid/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 about these weapons. Reports about Finnish gangsters, French rioters, Nigerian fighters, and Mexican cartels gaining weapons—like rifles and grenade launchers—from Ukraine have all been [debunked](https://riskbulletins.globalinitiative.net/ukr-obs-001/01-monitoring-illicit-arms-flows-from-the-conflict-in-ukraine.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 as Russian propaganda attempting to sway the United States and NATO allies to decrease arms transfers. The current US end-use monitoring program [focuses](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems and Anti-Tank/All-purpose Tactical Guided Missiles because of the classified information used to build those weapons. Contrarily, monitoring efforts have paid little attention to small arms and light weapons, yet those are the weapons more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations in Ukraine."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

.

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on March 10, 2025, that Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43%. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, with the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) being the main suppliers.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukrainian authorities have uncovered corruption schemes within the defense sector, involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices and kickbacks. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported on a scheme involving military drones and signal jamming systems, while Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) highlighted a scheme where participants received 30 percent of the contract amount. These revelations followed criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's actions regarding anti-corruption agencies.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

The sale of United States military equipment to foreign governments in 2024 surged 29 percent to a record $318.7bn, the US State Department said, a figure that includes the sale of jet fighters worth $18.8bn to Israel despite the country facing allegations of genocide in Gaza.

US weapons sales figures from the Biden administration’s final year were released on Friday, coming amid rising global instability and regional tensions.

Direct military sales by US companies rose to $200.8bn in fiscal 2024 up from $157.5bn in 2023, while sales arranged through the US government rose to $117.9 bn in 2024 over $80.9bn the prior year.

The State Department said in a statement that arms sales and transfers are viewed as “important US foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security”.

Sales approved in 2024 included but were not limited to $23bn in F-16 jets and aircraft upgrades to Turkiye’s military, $18.8bn worth of F-15 fighter jets to Israel, and $2.5bn in sales of M1A2 Abrams tanks to Romania.

The State Department said the US takes a “holistic approach” to arms sales and “weighs political, social, human rights, civilian protection” among many factors – including economic and military – when determining “the appropriate provision of military equipment” to allies and partners.

However, US investigative journalism organisation ProPublica has reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ignored explicit warnings about Israeli human rights violations amid the war on Gaza and continued to approve arms transfers to the country [in violation of US law](/news/2024/5/2/how-us-violates-its-own-leahy-law-to-ensure-military-support-for-israel)
.

More than 47,200 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, and images record the devastation [as entire cities within the enclave](/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza)
 have been turned to rubble using bombs, missiles, warplanes and other weaponry supplied by the US.

Human rights groups, UN experts and even former US government officials have accused the Biden administration of knowingly funding Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza.

In November 2024, Human Rights Watch released a detailed report outlining how Israel had engaged in [a deliberate effort](/news/2024/11/14/israels-forced-displacement-in-gaza-amounts-to-war-crime-hrw)
 to permanently prevent Palestinians from returning to large parts of Gaza.

US defence contractors are straining to meet the surge of demand for weapons that has mushroomed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ministries of defence globally have been lining up to submit orders to boost their inventories with US weapons, while the US is seeking to replenish its own stockpiles after weaponry and munitions were sent to Kyiv in support of its war with Russia.

A surge is also expected this year as orders approved in 2024 often go into the order backlog for US weapons makers, who are planning for a surge in demand for artillery rounds, Patriot missile interceptors and armoured vehicles.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukrainian authorities have uncovered corruption schemes within the defense sector, involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices and kickbacks. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported on a scheme involving military drones and signal jamming systems, while Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) highlighted a scheme where participants received 30 percent of the contract amount. These revelations followed criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's actions regarding anti-corruption agencies.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost billions in military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/20/trumps-10pc-markup-arms-sales-ukraine-security-guarantees/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/20/trumps-10pc-markup-arms-sales-ukraine-security-guarantees/)) reports that Donald Trump could use a 10 percent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund US security guarantees for Ukraine <image:0>, <image:1>. The Harvard International Review ([https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/](https://hir.harvard.edu/facts-or-false-alarms-the-state-of-illicit-arms-in-ukraine/)) states that Ukraine has historically had a large black market for arms and mentions reports of weapons being stolen in Ukraine since 2022.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43% ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The U.S. saw a 29% increase in arms sales to a record $318.7 billion in 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand)). The Washington Post reports that U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

The US-made M240 machine gun was offered for sale at US$8 000 and a Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher at US$6 000 – expensive, but a bargain for interested criminals, given the capabilities of such weapons. 

Elsewhere, there are signs that the arms trafficking market is becoming more organized, with larger stockpiles being assembled. ![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments."

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43% ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The U.S. saw a 29% increase in arms sales to a record $318.7 billion in 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand)). The Washington Post reports that U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

President Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America’s deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal.

The shift comes as the Pentagon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade.

The White House never announced that Mr. But the emerging partnership between Russia and China, and the conventional arms North Korea and Iran are providing to Russia for the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed Washington’s thinking.

Already, Russia and China are [conducting military exercises together](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/asia/china-russia-military-patrols.html)
. Xi’s ambitions was understood.

The Biden strategy sharpens that focus to reflect [the Pentagon’s estimates that](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/world/asia/china-nuclear-missiles.html)
 China’s nuclear force would expand to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, roughly the numbers that the United States and Russia now deploy. “And in particular,” he added, the weapons guidance accounted for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

In June, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, also [referred to the document](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/us/politics/us-nuclear-russia-china.html)
, the first to examine in detail whether the United States is prepared to respond to nuclear crises that break out simultaneously or sequentially, with a combination of nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.

The new strategy, Mr. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia [is aiding the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/asia/russia-korea-defense-asia.html)

The new document is a stark reminder that whoever is sworn in next Jan. Biden and his aides, looking at intercepts of conversations between senior Russian commanders, feared the [likelihood of nuclear use](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/us/politics/biden-nuclear-russia-ukraine.html)
 might rise to 50 percent or even higher.

Mr. Biden, along with leaders of Germany and Britain, got China and India to make public statements that there was no role for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the crisis abated, at least temporarily.

“It was an important moment,” Richard N."

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Cooperation Between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia: Current and Potential Future Threats to America
=========================================================================================================

Each one of these states threatens U.S. To make matters worse, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are increasing their support for one another. How likely is this scenario?

This paper examines the state of cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and identifies paths that could lead to their closer cooperation—and paths that would not. A concluding section draws policy implications.

### **Cooperation in Pairs So Far**

Although China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are now often viewed as an aligned group, cooperation among them has been almost entirely bilateral so far. Security Council resolution banning the practice.29 A few years ago, Pyongyang was estimated to receive $500 million annually this way, which it spends on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.30 China also illicitly facilitates the export of millions of barrels of oil to North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers.31

While China’s support lessens the economic pressure that international sanctions put on Pyongyang, China’s security commitment is essential for it.32 Beijing also defends North Korea in international forums, vetoing resolutions that would tighten sanctions, and sometimes introducing measures to loosen them.33

There are limits, however, to cooperation in this dyad. For example, China has to date refused to provide North Korea with nuclear-weapons technology and expertise, and it has supported some sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s nuclear program.34 Some analysts even concluded that North Korea carried out its ballistic missile test close to Japan in 2022 to demonstrate that it had the long-range capacity to strike areas of value to Beijing.35

Mostly, China must manage the risk of disaster in North Korea."
