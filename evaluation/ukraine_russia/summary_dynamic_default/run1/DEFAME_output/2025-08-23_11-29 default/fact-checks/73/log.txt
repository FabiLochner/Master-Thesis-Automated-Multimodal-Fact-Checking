Content: Reuters reports that a Ukrainian pilot was killed and an F-16 fighter jet was lost during a Russian nighttime missile and drone attack. The article was published on June 29, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-loses-16-fighter-amid-massed-russian-drone/story?id=123315001): 
Content: ABC News reports that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was lost during an attempt to repel a Russian attack. The article mentions that the pilot, Maksym Ustimenko, shot down seven targets before his F-16 was damaged. The article was published on June 29, 2025, and the author is David Brennan. <image:4546> shows a Ukrainian air force F-16.

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts an F-16 fighter jet that crashed in a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019 due to mechanical failure, as reported by The Press-Enterprise ([Source](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), not a Russian attack. While there have been reports of Ukrainian F-16s being lost in combat with Russia, the image is misrepresented.

So, the overall veracity is: false
