### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Fox News article written by Aubrie Spady, discussing the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" and its alleged receipt of $140,000,000 per month from USAID. ![image 11](media/14.jpg) The article claims the center has been creating fakes, comment bots, and artificially increasing views since 2022. Aubrie Spady is a writer for Fox News Digital.

The article is available at [https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady) and [https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/s/aubrie-spady](https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/s/aubrie-spady).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/) debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The article was not found on the Fox News website, and the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center. The [DW article](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) fact-checks a claim that Fox News reported USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center, stating that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The US Congress appropriated $182.75 billion for Ukraine-related efforts between 2022 and 2024, with USAID's share being approximately $39.9 billion, and there was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine))) is about the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine, a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces established in 2003. The center is involved in psychological and informational warfare. ![image 11](media/14.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is not entirely accurate. While the image appears to be a screenshot of a Fox News article, fact-checking reveals that the article is likely manipulated. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish such an article. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that the US Congress allocated a significant amount of money for Ukraine-related efforts, but there is no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to the center.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish such an article.
