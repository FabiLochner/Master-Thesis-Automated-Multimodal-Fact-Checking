"Live Now made an unintentional mistake Saturday evening during extensive live coverage of Easter services from around the world," a spokesperson said in response to a _Newsweek_ comment request. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. ET) on Saturday and midnight into Monday morning as part of an Easter truce resting on "humanitarian" concerns.

The announcement [was quickly met with skepticism from Kyiv officials](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-easter-truce-russia-ukraine-backlash-2061857)

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

"As of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)

On Easter, American broadcaster Fox News aired a service from the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow, attended by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.

The broadcast also showed an Easter service from Kyiv, but later referred to it as part of Russia.

For several hours, Fox News broadcast the ceremony in Moscow, where, alongside Putin, the city’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin was also present.

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, was featured on air with an address to Russians in which he called for the “unity of historical Rus’” and for “peace” that, according to him, should extend across the lands that received “grace in the baptismal font of Kyiv.”

At first, the video was labeled correctly: “Easter service: Kyiv, Ukraine.”

However, after a break in the broadcast, Fox News resumed the coverage with a caption that read: “Easter service: Kyiv, Russia.”

Earlier, we [reported](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/holy-war-russian-orthodox-church-offers-kremlin-1711782718.html)
 that the Russian Orthodox Church has been promoting an ultranationalist ideology of “Holy War” to the Kremlin.

Evidence Showing Biden Did Not Board 'Empty Plane'

[Mediaite.com](https://www.mediaite.com/online/conservatives-insist-biden-confusingly-boarded-wrong-airplane-heres-what-actually-happened/)
 published that The Independent's White House correspondent [Andrew Feinberg](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/andrew-feinberg)
 — who served as White House pool reporter at Joint Base Andrews — confirmed Biden boarded the plane to greet the people still onboard after the freed prisoners had deplaned. The caption clearly states Biden stepped onto the plane "to talk to the pilot who flew the former prisoners."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.

In short:

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris welcomed the three Americans released in the prison swap as their plane touched down in Maryland. 

Mr Biden thanked the collective effort of the countries involved in the major international swap. 

What's next?
------------

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

US President Joe Biden has welcomed home the three Americans who were sentenced to years in Russian penal colonies after secret "sham" trials and now free under a major East-West prisoner swap. 

Mr Biden and Kamala Harris met the plane carrying detainees that landed in the United States on Thursday, local time, in Maryland. 

The president stressed the importance of diplomacy and praised the collective effort of Washington's allies in the multinational deal.

"Alliances make a difference," he said. 

"They stepped up, they took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.

"I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interest and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia," Mr Biden said. 

Vice-President Harris said it was "an extraordinary day".

"You can see it in the families, in their eyes and in their cries."

The freed Americans include the Wall Street Journal's Moscow correspondent Evan Gershkovich, [who was jailed for 16 years last month,](/news/2024-07-19/evan-gershkovich-wsj-sentencing-russia-espionage-case/104120938)

They were both serving sentences on spying charges that the US says were false.

Also released was Alsu Kurmasheva, a reporter for a US-funded radio network in Europe, who was last month jailed for six and a half years for "spreading false information" about the Russian military.

British-Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize winner who had written for the Washington Post, was also freed. He said Buenos Nochas."

Earlier on Thursday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the prisoner exchange, said that traitors to his country should rot and die in prison, but that it was more useful for Moscow to get its own people home.

"And let the traitors now feverishly adopt new names and actively disguise themselves under witness protection programmes," Mr Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

Six countries release at least one prisoner 
--------------------------------------------

Russia also received three men charged by federal authorities in the US, including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. 

Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being in a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges.

"Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world," Mr Biden said earlier.

All told, six countries released at least one prisoner.

The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the US to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offences. 

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing in a letter: "We know the US government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice."

Though she called for a change to the dynamic, "for now," she wrote, "we are celebrating the return of Evan."

The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The swap was coordinated by Türkiye, its intelligence agency said, and the American and German prisoners were taken to its capital, Ankara, before they were able to return home.

Eight Russians — who were being held in the US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia — were released too. I will see you again, we will talk about your future." 

On Friday, the Kremlin said Vadim Krasikov was an employee of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and had served in Alpha Group, the FSB's special forces unit.

Among those also released to Moscow was a Russian family, the Dultsevs and their two children, whom a court in Slovenia convicted of pretending to be Argentinians in order to spy on the EU and NATO member state.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the couple were "illegals" — deep-cover agents trained to impersonate foreigners, who spend years living abroad in their cover identities.

"The children of the 'illegal' intelligence agents who flew in yesterday only learnt that they were Russian after the plane took off (for Moscow) from Ankara," Mr Peskov told reporters.

"Before that, they didn't know that they were Russian and that they had anything to do with our country. And you probably saw that when the children came down the plane's steps that they don't speak Russian and that Putin greeted them in Spanish."

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) Biden’s national security adviser, had held back tears as he told reporters earlier in the day that a multicountry agreement, which released 24 prisoners from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia, had been a “vintage Joe Biden” act of statecraft.

As he took question after question from waiting reporters, Mr. The Russian American editor rushed into the arms of her sobbing daughter.

In the middle of the emotional scene that unfolded on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews late Thursday was President Biden. Biden had triumphantly announced that his administration’s diplomatic efforts had secured the release of three American prisoners held by Russia. Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva deplaned and were greeted by cheers, applause and family members.

“It feels wonderful,” Mr. Biden told reporters. Biden, they provided a seeming vindication of the type of patient, multilateral diplomacy that he proudly practices but that has so far proved unable to halt wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden seemed intent on reminding everyone what exactly that meant.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that Joe Biden was present when the freed Americans arrived in the U.S. in August 2024. The evidence also indicates that Biden boarded the plane. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the plane was empty when Biden boarded it. The Times of India article states that Biden entered an empty plane, but the Yahoo News article suggests that Biden boarded the plane to speak to the people who helped bring the freed prisoners home.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the exact reason for Biden boarding the plane is not entirely clear.

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

JD Vance criticised Fema's response to the hurricane at a rally in Butler on Saturday

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

! <image:4224>!Getty Images Destroyed houses and buildings along the Broad River in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Bat Cave, North Carolina <image:4229>Getty Images

Were any helicopters sent to help victims?
------------------------------------------

Trump said at the Butler rally that “Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina - no helicopters, no rescue - it’s just - what’s happened there is very bad.”

This is false.

White House blasts false claims about Hurricane Helene and relief aid
=====================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

Statement comes as president urges Congress to pass disaster-relief package as costs soar amid devastation

The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that [Hurricane Helene](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene)
 was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.

“We have seen a large increase in false information circulating online related to the federal response to Hurricane Helene,” a statement said, pointing to a “number of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort.”

The White House said the rumors, which include claims that emergency disaster money had been spent housing immigrants and that relief funds would be limited to $750 per claim, were “wrong, dangerous” and said “it must stop immediately”.

The warning, which speaks to the intense political environment Helene figuratively crashed into, came hours after Biden told lawmakers to refill the coffers of disaster relief programs as the projected recovery and rebuilding costs related to Hurricane Helene are estimated to be as much as $200bn over 10 years.

[In a letter sent to congressional leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/04/letter-to-congress-on-disaster-needs/)
, the president said while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Department of Defense are able to meet “critical life-saving and life-sustaining missions and will continue to do so within present funding levels”, they will need additional funding.

“My administration has provided robust and well-coordinated federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts,” Biden wrote.

“As with other catastrophic disasters, it will take some time to assess the full requirements for response and recovery efforts, and I fully expect that the Congress will do its part to provide the funding needed.”

Biden said that a comprehensive disaster relief package would be necessary when Congress returns on 12 November – but said action on individual programs could be needed before then. But there are currently no plans for Congress to reconvene before the election.

The request comes as Kamala Harris cut short a campaign swing through the western states to visit western North Carolina in the southern Appalachian mountains where entire towns were washed away.

Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas by air on Wednesday, and again in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. Administration officials [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/biden-warns-congress-disaster-funding-run-out/index.html)
 that the program needs $1.6bn in additional funding to meet about 3,000 Hurricane Helene-related applications it is receiving daily.

Last month, before Helene hit, the White House [warned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/H.R.-9747-Continuing-Appropriations-and-Extensions-Act-2025-Final-Updated.pdf)
 that the low funding levels could lead to the SBA “effectively ceasing operations” after paying out for weather-related costs and accidents, including the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the continued recovery after Maui’s wildfires and tornado damage in the midwest.

A storm-damaged area in the wake of Hurricane Helene in Florida on Thursday. He said the work to rebuild will cost “billions of dollars” and additional disaster relief funding “can’t wait … people need help now”.

At least 225 people have been confirmed dead from Helene, and officials say they expect the death toll to continue to rise as recovery efforts continue. A police department spokesperson in Asheville, North Carolina, [told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-satellite-images-north-carolina/)
 in an email late on Friday that it is “actively working 75 cases of missing persons”. Nearly 1 million people remain without power.

In his letter to lawmakers, Biden said that funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) “will run out of funding in a matter of weeks and well before the Congress is planning to reconvene”.

The SBA is designed to help small business owners and homeowners recoup property and equipment through the disaster relief loan program."

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

**A fake Charlie Hebdo cover is being spread on Facebook. Notably, in March 2025, the magazine [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/domenico.farina.31/posts/10223728579482001)
 claims to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that this image was created by the magazine. It is fake.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Zelenskyy in a coffin. **[(RELATED: Is Elon Musk Paying The Salaries Of The Rescued Astronauts For A ‘Full Year?’)](https://checkyourfact.com/2025/03/24/fact-check-musk-paying-salaries-rescued-astronauts-full-year/)

From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake."

From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025): 
Content: "Russia has leveled some Ukrainian cities as it has attacked and occupied them, such as Mariupol.\[4\] Cities throughout the 80 percent of Ukraine that Russian forces have not occupied have remained largely intact during Russia's invasion, apart from deliberate Russian strikes against critical and civilian infrastructure.\[5\]

**Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections in wartime (unlike the US Constitution, which requires it).**

Ukraine's Constitution prevents the Ukrainian government from holding elections or amending the constitution in times of martial law.\[6\]

Russia triggered Ukraine's martial law provisions when it launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government cannot constitutionally suspend martial law while Russia continues to attack Ukraine.

Ukrainian opposition politicians, including those who have historically run against Zelensky, have stated that holding elections under martial law would be both illegal and immoral.\[7\]

**Ukraine has not suffered millions of losses.**

Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses by any reliable estimate, either in terms of civilian or military casualties.

Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion, and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action.\[8\]

US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000, but no reputable source places casualty estimates near or in the millions.\[9\]

The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024.\[10\]

**Europe provides about as much direct aid to Ukraine as the United States.**

Europe (including European Union \[EU\] members and EU institutions plus Norway and the UK) has overtaken the United States in terms of cumulative direct (military and non-military) aid allocations to Ukraine (not counting the costs of US forces forward-deployed in Eastern Europe).\[11\]

*   Europe has provided Ukraine with a total of $166 billion in cumulative aid and pledged an additional $34.7 billion to be allocated through 2030.\[12\]
*   Europe has provided and pledged approximately $204.1 billion in all — over $174 billion from the EU, $13.9 billion from Norway, and $16.2 billion from the UK — compared to America's $183 billion.\[13\]
*   These figures do not include the EU and G7 commitments to provide loans to Ukraine financed by income generated from frozen Russian assets.

**European loans to Ukraine are backed by income from frozen Russian assets, not Ukraine.**

The EU is contributing $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that are backed by extraordinary revenues from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not Ukraine.\[14\]

*   The EU holds approximately $220.5 billion in Russian frozen assets.\[15\]
*   The EU has already made available $1.6 billion for Ukraine from immobilized Russian assets and disbursed $3.2 billion in loans in January 2025.

**Ukraine did not misuse or lose half of the aid the United States has provided.**

The majority of the funds the United States has allocated for Ukraine stays in the United States to fund domestic defense industrial base and replenish US stockpiles.\[16\]

US government agencies closely oversee the remaining US aid, which is directly issued to Ukraine. <image:3606>**](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UKR%20support%20fact%20sheet%2C%20February%2021%2C%202025%20PDF%201.pdf)

**Zelensky does not imminently risk losing all of Ukraine.**

Russian forces currently occupy around 20 percent of Ukraine, leaving the remaining 80 percent of the country under Ukraine's sovereign control.

At the current rate of advance, it would take Russian forces over 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine, assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely.

Russia's rate of advance on the frontline has slowed significantly over the past three months.\[1\]

Russian forces are making small territorial gains at the cost of massive personnel losses.\[2\]

Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 27.94 square kilometers per day in November 2024, 18.1 square kilometers per day in December 2024, and 16.1 square kilometers per day in January 2025.\[3\]

**Most Ukrainian cities have not been destroyed.**

Many of Ukraine's largest cities, including Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa, have avoided destruction and continue to function. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Office of the Inspector General reported on January 11, 2024, that it had found no evidence of misappropriated aid.\[17\]

**Ukraine repeatedly invited Putin to negotiate in early 2022.**

Zelensky proposed to meet with Putin on February 19, 2022 — just five days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\[18\] Putin ignored this request and invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\[19\]

Zelensky called for direct talks with Putin "in any format" in March 2022 and offered to compromise on Ukraine's accession into NATO.\[20\] The Russians demanded the full surrender and demilitarization of Ukraine.\[21\]

Zelensky also expressed openness to discussing the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on the condition that the Ukrainian people would ratify any deal through a referendum.\[22\] Putin rejected that offer as well.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a Ukraine Fact Sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). Zelensky stated that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers, and Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024. <image:3606> <image:k>

Content: "More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.

Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.

Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. Winning a war of attrition requires a willingness to absorb considerable casualties and significant losses of equipment.40 In Ukraine, Russia has some advantages in population size and industrial mobilization, particularly with the help of China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries.

### [Can Ukraine Fight Without U.S. While some policymakers and experts argue that Russia holds “all the cards” in the Ukraine war, the data suggests that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield._

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.”1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.”2 In addition, some U.S. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.”4 Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? Russia’s marginal gains are particularly noteworthy compared to its conquest of 120,000 square kilometers during the first five weeks of the war and Ukraine’s recapture of 50,000 square kilometers in the spring of 2022.

Third, Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment across the land, air, and sea domains, highlighting the sharp matériel toll of its attrition campaign. Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.

Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars _combined_ between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.6

Ukraine says Russia’s military losses have topped 1 million in 3 years of war
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jun 12, 2025 2:00 PM EDT

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The number of Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine has topped 1 million, military officials in Kyiv said Thursday, describing the huge price that Moscow has paid for its 3-year-old invasion.

The claim by the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, which came on a holiday celebrating Russia’s sovereignty, is in line with Western intelligence estimates.

President Vladimir Putin marked Russia Day by hosting a Kremlin meeting with soldiers decorated for their service in Ukraine, but neither he nor any other officials commented on the Ukrainian claim.

The U.K. Earlier this year, the General Staff of the Russian armed forces claimed that Ukrainian military losses had topped 1 million.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last spoke of Ukrainian military losses in February, when he said in an interview that 45,100 troops had been killed and about 390,000 injured.

The mutual claims of the other side’s losses couldn’t be independently verified.

### Russia launches more drone strikes

The casualty estimates came as Russian forces pummeled Ukraine with drones and other weapons, killing three people and injuring scores of others despite international pressure to accept a ceasefire.

According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia launched 63 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight. He previously reported three other injuries.

### Russia pushes its slow offensive in Ukraine’s east

The recent escalation in aerial attacks has come alongside a renewed Russian battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line.

While Russian missile and drone barrage have struck regions all across Ukraine, regions along the front line have faced daily Russian attacks with short-range exploding drones and glide bombs.

On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed its troops captured two more villages in the Donetsk region, Oleksiivka and Petrivske. During their June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely.

### Russia and Ukraine exchange more POWs

The only tangible outcome of the talks was an agreement to exchange prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers.

Russia and Ukraine conducted another POW swap on Thursday that included severely wounded and gravely ill captives, although the sides did not report the numbers.

“Our people are coming home,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram. 24, 2022.

On June 3, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said Russia likely would hit the mark of 1 million casualties this summer in what it called “a stunning and grisly milestone.”

Russia last reported its military casualties early in the war when it acknowledged that about 6,000 soldiers had been killed. One person was killed and 14 others were also injured in the southern Kherson region, which is partly occupied by Russian forces, police said.

The authorities in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said 18 people, including four children, were injured by Russian drone attacks overnight.

**WATCH:** [How Ukraine’s drones have transformed the fight against Russia](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-ukraines-drones-have-transformed-the-fight-against-russia)

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian drones targeted residential districts, educational facilities, kindergartens and other civilian infrastructure.

“Kharkiv is holding on. And that is the most important thing,” Terekhov said.

Russia has launched waves of drones and missiles in recent days, with a record bombardment of almost 500 drones on Monday and a wave of 315 drones and seven missiles overnight on Tuesday.

Ukraine responded to the Russian attacks with drone raids. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 52 Ukrainian drones early Thursday, including 41 over the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. The Ukrainian military had no immediate comment on the Russian claim.

The attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. This is already the second stage of returning those who are severely wounded and seriously ill.”

According to Ukraine’s Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, some of the repatriated soldiers had been listed as missing in action."

As of August 21, 2025, the OHCHR recorded 13,883 civilian deaths and 35,548 injuries in Ukraine since February 24, 2022, according to the Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). A British Army official estimated that Russia would have 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. Russia Matters, in a report dated February 26, 2025, estimated that Russia had more than 700,000 military casualties as of January 2025, with 48,000 missing soldiers ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a Ukraine Fact Sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). Zelensky stated that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers, and Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024. <image:3606> <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CSIS reports that Russia has suffered extraordinary fatalities in the Ukraine war, with fatalities roughly five times as many as in all Russian and Soviet wars combined between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The article mentions an event titled "One Million Casualties: Russia’s Losses on the Battlefield" on June 13, 2025. ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)) <image:3635>, <image:3636>

PBS News reports that according to Ukrainian military officials, the number of Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine has topped 1 million. The article is dated June 12, 2025. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war)) <image:3639>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties for Russia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). Russia Matters estimated over 700,000 military casualties as of January 2025 ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)).

PBS News reported that Ukrainian military officials stated that the number of Russian troops killed or wounded has topped 1 million as of June 12, 2025 ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war)). CSIS also mentions an event titled "One Million Casualties: Russia’s Losses on the Battlefield" on June 13, 2025 ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)).

The claim's specific figure of 1.5 million is within the range of estimates provided by the British Army official. However, the evidence does not provide a precise figure for February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war as of February 2025 is plausible, as estimates from various sources, including a British Army official, suggest a range that encompasses this figure. However, the exact number for February 2025 is not explicitly confirmed by the provided evidence.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, and PBS News reported that Russian losses topped 1 million by June 2025 ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war)), the exact figure for February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

Donald Trump could use a 10 per cent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund [US security guarantees](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/19/what-security-guarantees-could-donald-trump-give-ukraine/)
 for Ukraine, his treasury secretary has said.

Scott Bessent revealed that the president had increased the price of US military hardware being [bought by European countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/06/russia-ukraine-deal-trump-zelensky-putin-war-latest-news/)
 for Ukraine by 10 per cent.

“We are selling arms to Europeans, who are then selling them on to the Ukrainians, and President Trump is taking 10 per cent mark-up on the arms,” Mr Bessent told Fox News. “So maybe that 10 per cent will cover the cost of the air cover.”

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he would be willing to use US air power to [support a European security force](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/17/ukraine-russia-war-latest-european-leaders-to-meet-trump/)
 in Ukraine as part of any settlement to end the war with Russia.

European nations have already pledged to buy at least $10bn in American-made military equipment for Kyiv in recent weeks.

Ukraine has also tabled a proposal that would see the country promise to buy a further [$90bn worth of hardware](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/19/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-trump-peace/)
 after its war with Russia comes to an end.

Mr Trump has insisted for some time that he will no longer spend US taxpayers’ money on supporting Ukraine, the defence of which he believes is a problem for European nations.

Nato military leaders hold summit
---------------------------------

Planning for a multinational force to be sent to Ukraine has been accelerated after the US president signalled he would be willing to contribute during talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, and European leaders.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the British chief of defence staff, was in Washington on Wednesday for talks with his US counterpart, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.

They joined a virtual meeting of Nato’s military leaders “as diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, an Italian admiral who heads the alliance’s military committee, said.

The plans being discussed would see a European force train and develop Ukraine’s armed forces, while securing its skies and seas. But he has ruled out putting American boots on the ground as part of assistance.

Meanwhile, the suggestion of a European peacekeeping force stationed in Ukraine has been met with veiled rejections from Moscow.

Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, warned that discussion of security guarantees without the Kremlin’s involvement was a “road to nowhere”.

Russia signals peace deal not close
-----------------------------------

Russia’s top diplomat suggested that any guarantees should be on the basis of Russian demands from initial peace talks in the spring of 2022, which [gave Moscow a veto](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/20/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-trump-peace/)
 over any military aid for Kyiv.

“We cannot agree with the fact that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation. This will not work,” said Mr Lavrov on Wednesday.

“I am sure that in the West, and above all in the United States, they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia – it’s a road to nowhere.”

This week, Moscow also issued a categorical rejection of “any scenarios involving the deployment of Nato troops in Ukraine”.

In a sign that a peace deal is not within reach, Mr Lavrov accused the European leaders who met Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky of carrying out “a fairly aggressive escalation of the situation, rather clumsy and, in general, unethical attempts to change the position of the Trump administration and the president of the United States personally”."

The illicit nature of banned weapons and the potential for weaponry theft and circulation on the black market raise genuine concerns about the security of arms sales to Ukraine. Facts or False Alarms: The State of Illicit Arms in Ukraine
===========================================================

19.Jun.2024 . Ukraine has historically had one of the largest [black markets](https://www.cato.org/blog/tragic-unsurprising-costs-loose-us-weapons-ukraine?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 for arms in Europe, with around 300,000 small arms and light weapons reported lost or stolen during the Russian invasion of Crimea between 2013 and 2015. This number is small compared to the estimated US$32 billion [lost](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 in Ukrainian military equipment stolen and sold on the black market between 1992 and 1998. These two problems, which continue to plague lawmakers in Washington, have been exacerbated by the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine.

### The Illegal Movement of Weapons

_Weaponry Theft in Ukraine: Reality or Russian Disinformation?_

The invasion of Ukraine has [led](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 to a larger quantity of weapons entering Europe, and thus a greater possibility for weapons to go missing. Since 2022, there have been sporadic [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/pentagon-watchdog-report-ukraine-weaponry/index.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 of small and large arms being stolen in Ukraine. Although it is difficult to confirm when and where weapons are stolen, the sheer scale of [weapon transfers](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 means that it is highly likely that some weapons will go missing over the course of the conflict.

However, when examining the extent to which illicit weapons are being used or sold in Ukraine, it is important to acknowledge the massive amount of Russian [disinformation](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4403926-pentagon-watchdog-ukraine-military-aid/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 about these weapons. Reports about Finnish gangsters, French rioters, Nigerian fighters, and Mexican cartels gaining weapons—like rifles and grenade launchers—from Ukraine have all been [debunked](https://riskbulletins.globalinitiative.net/ukr-obs-001/01-monitoring-illicit-arms-flows-from-the-conflict-in-ukraine.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 as Russian propaganda attempting to sway the United States and NATO allies to decrease arms transfers. The current US end-use monitoring program [focuses](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems and Anti-Tank/All-purpose Tactical Guided Missiles because of the classified information used to build those weapons. Contrarily, monitoring efforts have paid little attention to small arms and light weapons, yet those are the weapons more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations in Ukraine."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).
    
*   **North Korea** exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. Alexander Cook

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

The sale of United States military equipment to foreign governments in 2024 surged 29 percent to a record $318.7bn, the US State Department said, a figure that includes the sale of jet fighters worth $18.8bn to Israel despite the country facing allegations of genocide in Gaza.

US weapons sales figures from the Biden administration’s final year were released on Friday, coming amid rising global instability and regional tensions.

Direct military sales by US companies rose to $200.8bn in fiscal 2024 up from $157.5bn in 2023, while sales arranged through the US government rose to $117.9 bn in 2024 over $80.9bn the prior year.

The State Department said in a statement that arms sales and transfers are viewed as “important US foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security”.

Sales approved in 2024 included but were not limited to $23bn in F-16 jets and aircraft upgrades to Turkiye’s military, $18.8bn worth of F-15 fighter jets to Israel, and $2.5bn in sales of M1A2 Abrams tanks to Romania.

The State Department said the US takes a “holistic approach” to arms sales and “weighs political, social, human rights, civilian protection” among many factors – including economic and military – when determining “the appropriate provision of military equipment” to allies and partners.

However, US investigative journalism organisation ProPublica has reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ignored explicit warnings about Israeli human rights violations amid the war on Gaza and continued to approve arms transfers to the country [in violation of US law](/news/2024/5/2/how-us-violates-its-own-leahy-law-to-ensure-military-support-for-israel)
.

More than 47,200 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, and images record the devastation [as entire cities within the enclave](/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza)
 have been turned to rubble using bombs, missiles, warplanes and other weaponry supplied by the US.

Human rights groups, UN experts and even former US government officials have accused the Biden administration of knowingly funding Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza.

In November 2024, Human Rights Watch released a detailed report outlining how Israel had engaged in [a deliberate effort](/news/2024/11/14/israels-forced-displacement-in-gaza-amounts-to-war-crime-hrw)
 to permanently prevent Palestinians from returning to large parts of Gaza.

US defence contractors are straining to meet the surge of demand for weapons that has mushroomed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ministries of defence globally have been lining up to submit orders to boost their inventories with US weapons, while the US is seeking to replenish its own stockpiles after weaponry and munitions were sent to Kyiv in support of its war with Russia.

A surge is also expected this year as orders approved in 2024 often go into the order backlog for US weapons makers, who are planning for a surge in demand for artillery rounds, Patriot missile interceptors and armoured vehicles.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43% ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The U.S. saw a 29% increase in arms sales to a record $318.7 billion in 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/25/us-hits-record-arms-sales-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-demand)). The Washington Post reports that U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about Ukraine selling armaments it receives from the United States.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

The US-made M240 machine gun was offered for sale at US$8 000 and a Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher at US$6 000 – expensive, but a bargain for interested criminals, given the capabilities of such weapons. 

Elsewhere, there are signs that the arms trafficking market is becoming more organized, with larger stockpiles being assembled. ![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukrainian authorities have uncovered corruption schemes within the defense sector, involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices and kickbacks. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported on a scheme involving military drones and signal jamming systems, while Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) highlighted a scheme where participants received 30 percent of the contract amount. These revelations followed criticism of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's actions regarding anti-corruption agencies.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost billions in military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The website forumarmstrade.org ([https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html)) lists arms transfers to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, which has provided military aid such as F-16 sustainment services, air defense, and artillery rounds. The U.S. Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.

The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/20/trumps-10pc-markup-arms-sales-ukraine-security-guarantees/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/08/20/trumps-10pc-markup-arms-sales-ukraine-security-guarantees/)) reports that Donald Trump could use a 10 percent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund US security guarantees for Ukraine <image:0>, <image:1>.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that corruption and theft within Ukraine's defense sector are significant issues. There are reports of inflated prices, kickbacks, and missing military equipment, including $1 billion worth of equipment that the Pentagon did not properly track. Additionally, Ukraine has a history of a large black market for arms. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the percentage of arms being sold.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to determine the extent of arms sales.

In the past, the likelihood that American adversaries could coordinate nuclear threats to outmaneuver the American nuclear arsenal seemed remote.

President Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America’s deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal.

The shift comes as the Pentagon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade.

The White House never announced that Mr. But the emerging partnership between Russia and China, and the conventional arms North Korea and Iran are providing to Russia for the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed Washington’s thinking.

Already, Russia and China are [conducting military exercises together](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/asia/china-russia-military-patrols.html)
. Xi’s ambitions was understood.

The Biden strategy sharpens that focus to reflect [the Pentagon’s estimates that](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/world/asia/china-nuclear-missiles.html)
 China’s nuclear force would expand to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, roughly the numbers that the United States and Russia now deploy. “And in particular,” he added, the weapons guidance accounted for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

In June, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, also [referred to the document](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/us/politics/us-nuclear-russia-china.html)
, the first to examine in detail whether the United States is prepared to respond to nuclear crises that break out simultaneously or sequentially, with a combination of nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.

The new strategy, Mr. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia [is aiding the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/asia/russia-korea-defense-asia.html)
.

The new document is a stark reminder that whoever is sworn in next Jan. Biden and his aides, looking at intercepts of conversations between senior Russian commanders, feared the [likelihood of nuclear use](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/us/politics/biden-nuclear-russia-ukraine.html)
 might rise to 50 percent or even higher.

Mr. Biden, along with leaders of Germany and Britain, got China and India to make public statements that there was no role for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the crisis abated, at least temporarily.

“It was an important moment,” Richard N."

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)

Cooperation Between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia: Current and Potential Future Threats to America
=========================================================================================================

Each one of these states threatens U.S. To make matters worse, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are increasing their support for one another. How likely is this scenario?

This paper examines the state of cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and identifies paths that could lead to their closer cooperation—and paths that would not. A concluding section draws policy implications.

### **Cooperation in Pairs So Far**

Although China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are now often viewed as an aligned group, cooperation among them has been almost entirely bilateral so far. Security Council resolution banning the practice.29 A few years ago, Pyongyang was estimated to receive $500 million annually this way, which it spends on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.30 China also illicitly facilitates the export of millions of barrels of oil to North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers.31

While China’s support lessens the economic pressure that international sanctions put on Pyongyang, China’s security commitment is essential for it.32 Beijing also defends North Korea in international forums, vetoing resolutions that would tighten sanctions, and sometimes introducing measures to loosen them.33

There are limits, however, to cooperation in this dyad. For example, China has to date refused to provide North Korea with nuclear-weapons technology and expertise, and it has supported some sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s nuclear program.34 Some analysts even concluded that North Korea carried out its ballistic missile test close to Japan in 2022 to demonstrate that it had the long-range capacity to strike areas of value to Beijing.35

Mostly, China must manage the risk of disaster in North Korea."
