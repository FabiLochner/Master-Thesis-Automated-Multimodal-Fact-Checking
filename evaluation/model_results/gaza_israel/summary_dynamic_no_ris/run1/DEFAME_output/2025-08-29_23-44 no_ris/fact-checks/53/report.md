## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.


## Actions

web_search("Donald Trump Truth Social July 25 2024 \"I hope that America obliterates Israel\"")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 5352](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913004-996719.jpg), ![image 5354](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913008-261964.jpg), ![image 5357](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913017-893899.jpg), ![image 5355](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913010-062431.jpg). The article was published on October 15, 2024.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that a claim, similar to the one in the original claim, was fact-checked by Politifact and found to be false. The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false, as indicated by the Politifact fact-check. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. A Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) from October 15, 2024, fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be false.
