## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216). The attack was part of the ongoing Israeli–Lebanese conflict and was claimed by Hezbollah. Netanyahu and his wife were not present, and there were no injuries. <image:i>, ![image 5540](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913514-658764.jpg), ![image 5541](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913515-076396.jpg)

The Wikipedia article states that the drone hit a bedroom window but did not penetrate further due to reinforced glass. The Times of Israel article includes a tweet from Benjamin Netanyahu on October 19, 2024, describing the attack as an assassination attempt on "me and my wife."

The Guardian published an article on October 19, 2024, reporting that Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, was hit by a drone on Saturday (![image 8913](media/2025-08-30_00-14-1756512849-447306.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, the evidence explicitly states that neither Netanyahu nor his wife were present during the attack and that there were no casualties. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, but also confirms that there were no casualties. The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is demonstrably false, as multiple sources state that no one was harmed.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), there were no casualties.
