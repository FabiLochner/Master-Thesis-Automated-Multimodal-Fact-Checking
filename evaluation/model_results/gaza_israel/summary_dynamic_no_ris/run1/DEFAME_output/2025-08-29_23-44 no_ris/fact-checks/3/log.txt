The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image's geolocation suggests it was taken in Israel, not Thailand. While there were discussions about Israeli presence in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025, the image's location is inconsistent with the claim. The Bangkok Post ([Source](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) and The Nation ([Source](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) reported on the situation in Pai, but the image's location is not in Thailand.

So, the overall veracity is: false
