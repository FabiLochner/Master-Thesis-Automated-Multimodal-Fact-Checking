The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the geolocation data suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, and web searches confirm Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024, the original image was not found in the search results, and there is no direct evidence linking the image to a specific event or confirming the child's identity.

So, the overall veracity is: false
