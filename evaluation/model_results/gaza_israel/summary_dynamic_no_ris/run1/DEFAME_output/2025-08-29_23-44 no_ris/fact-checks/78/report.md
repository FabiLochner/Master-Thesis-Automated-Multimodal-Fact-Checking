Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" and vowed that Iran "will pay" for it. The Security Cabinet of Israel convened in a bunker in Jerusalem during the attacks. An NPR article reported that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentioned an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon.

An Al Jazeera article also covered the missile attack, noting that it was in response to Israeli actions. The article included reactions from world leaders, including Netanyahu, and mentioned the US pledged its support for Israel.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. During the attack, Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" and vowed that Iran "will pay" for it. The Security Cabinet of Israel convened in a bunker in Jerusalem.

The provided evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland. Instead, it shows that he was in Israel during the attack and responded to it. The search results about Netanyahu and Poland are related to a future event in January 2025.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, during which Netanyahu was in Israel and responded to the attack. There is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland. The search results about Netanyahu and Poland are related to a future event in January 2025.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is contradicted by evidence from multiple reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, during which Netanyahu was in Israel and responded to the attack, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Poland. The search results about Netanyahu and Poland are related to a future event in January 2025.
