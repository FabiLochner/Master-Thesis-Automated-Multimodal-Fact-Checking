Useful result: From [Source](https://www.972mag.com/hezbollah-rockets-palestinians-iron-dome-shelters/): 
Content: The search result from 972mag.com discusses Hezbollah attacks on Israel, including damage in Majd Al-Krum on October 16 and 25, 2024, and Ma'alot-Tarshiha on October 29, 2024. <image:9024>, <image:8213>, <image:8214>, <image:8215>. The article also mentions a protest on August 15, 2025, where protesters expressed concerns about Bezalel Smotrich.

The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the image depicts Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during those attacks.

So, the overall veracity is: false
