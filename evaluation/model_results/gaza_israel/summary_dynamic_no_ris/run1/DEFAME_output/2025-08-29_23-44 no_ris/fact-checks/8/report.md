### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Israeli strikes on Iran on October 26, 2024, which were codenamed Operation Days of Repentance. The strikes targeted military sites in Iran, Iraq, and Syria, including air defense batteries, UAV factories, and missile production facilities. The attacks were in response to Iranian strikes earlier that month and resulted in 42 deaths. The Guardian published an article on the same day, reporting on the airstrikes against military targets in Iran as retaliation for attacks against Israel. CNN also reported on the strikes, mentioning that they hit military targets and that four members of Iranâ€™s military were killed. The image ![image 8](media/8.jpg)
