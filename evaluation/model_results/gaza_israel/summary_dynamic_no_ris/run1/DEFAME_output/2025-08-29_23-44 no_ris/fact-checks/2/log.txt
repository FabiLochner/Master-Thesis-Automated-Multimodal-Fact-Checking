Useful result: From [Source](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363): 
Content: The search result from ABP Live states that the image of a woman holding a skeleton is digitally generated and fake. <image:8295>

The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim, depicting a woman holding a skeleton, is likely AI-generated and fake, according to image search results. While the context of the war in Gaza is supported by other evidence, the image's authenticity is not.

So, the overall veracity is: false
