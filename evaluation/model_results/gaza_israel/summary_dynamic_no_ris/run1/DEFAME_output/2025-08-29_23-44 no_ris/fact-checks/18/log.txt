Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-03-18/gal-gadot-walk-of-fame-pro-palestine-pro-israel-protesters-snow-white):

Content: Entertainment Weekly reports that Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony was disrupted by protestors. The article mentions a viral post depicting a vandalized Hollywood Walk of Fame star, but it is unclear if the images are original or manipulated. <image:15> The article also includes an image of Gal Gadot at her Hollywood Walk of Fame induction ceremony on March 18, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized): 
Content: Fox LA reports that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized with the words "baby killer" and a sticker that read "Israeli snipers target children." <image:8324> The vandalism occurred after Gadot received the star on March 18. The American Jewish Committee posted a photo of the vandalized star online.

The claim '<image:15> This image shows Gal Gadot’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame being destroyed in March 2025 just hours after being placed.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Multiple sources, including the Los Angeles Times and Fox LA, confirm that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized ([https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized](https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized)). However, the claim's assertion that the vandalism occurred hours after the star was placed is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
