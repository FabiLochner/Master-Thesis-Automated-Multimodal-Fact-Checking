Content: The search result from Asharq Al-Awsat shows Israeli forces in the countryside of Daraa. ![image 7729](media/2025-08-29_22-01-1756504903-285686.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli forces were present in the countryside of Daraa. However, the provided evidence does not specify the exact location within the Daraa countryside, nor does it confirm the date or the specific town of Tasil. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The image search result from Asharq Al-Awsat ([https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5178173-israeli-forces-infiltrate-several-syrian-villages-quneitra-and-daraa](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5178173-israeli-forces-infiltrate-several-syrian-villages-quneitra-and-daraa)) shows Israeli forces in the Daraa countryside, but it does not mention Tasil or a specific date.

To verify the claim, information about the specific location (Tasil) and the date (February 2025) is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria)) reports on an Israeli ground incursion in the Tasil area near Nawa, Syria, in April 2025, in response to fire from gunmen. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

The Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php)) also mentions an Israeli incursion into Tasil, a town in southern Syria, as a response to fire from gunmen, occurring overnight. ![image 42](media/69.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli forces were present in Tasil, Syria. The Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria)) both mention an Israeli incursion into Tasil.

However, the Al Jazeera report indicates the incursion occurred in April 2025, not February 2025 as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but incorrect regarding the date.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israeli forces entered Tasil, Syria. However, the provided evidence indicates that the incursion occurred in April 2025, not February 2025 as stated in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially inaccurate. While Israeli forces did enter Tasil, Syria, as confirmed by reports from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria)) and the Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php)), the incursion occurred in April 2025, not February 2025.
