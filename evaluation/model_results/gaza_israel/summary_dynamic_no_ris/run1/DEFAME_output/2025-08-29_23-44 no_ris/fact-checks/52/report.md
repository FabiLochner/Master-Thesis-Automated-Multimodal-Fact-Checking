## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) ![image 1632](media/2025-07-20_10-38-1753007935-200533.jpg)

Conversely, CNN reported that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving Gaza since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The Times of Israel also reported a 6% decline, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), with approximately 160,000 people fewer and around 45,500 Palestinians killed since the war began.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip)) estimates the population of Gaza to be around 2,050,000 in 2025 and mentions a 6% decline in population since the start of the war <image:k>. Statista ([https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/](https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/)) reports a total population of 2.1 million and mentions casualties and internally displaced refugees since October 7, 2023, due to the war. The World Population Review ([https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza)) estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth.


## Elaboration
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is contradicted by multiple sources. The NYCFPA article supports the claim, but it is based on growth forecasts from August 2023. CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% decline in population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). Wikipedia and Statista also mention a population decline.


## Final Judgement
The claim is contradicted by multiple sources, including CNN and The Times of Israel, which report a population decline in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The NYCFPA article supports the claim, but it is based on growth forecasts from August 2023.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While one source, the New York City Foreign Policy Association ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)), supports the claim, it is based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) report a 6% decline in population since October 7, 2023.
