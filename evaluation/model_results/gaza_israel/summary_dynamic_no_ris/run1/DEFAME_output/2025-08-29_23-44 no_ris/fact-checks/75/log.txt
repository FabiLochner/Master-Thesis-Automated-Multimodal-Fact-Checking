The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter), there is no evidence linking the image of burning tents to these strikes. Further searches revealed images of burning tents related to Israeli actions, but not to the Iranian strikes.

So, the overall veracity is: false
