## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.972mag.com/hezbollah-rockets-palestinians-iron-dome-shelters/): 
Content: The search result from 972mag.com discusses Hezbollah attacks on Israel, including damage in Majd Al-Krum on October 16 and 25, 2024, and Ma'alot-Tarshiha on October 29, 2024. ![image 9024](media/2025-08-30_00-23-1756513408-712733.jpg), ![image 8213](media/2025-08-29_22-25-1756506323-439510.jpg), ![image 8214](media/2025-08-29_22-25-1756506323-723311.jpg), ![image 8215](media/2025-08-29_22-25-1756506324-799876.jpg). The article also mentions a protest on August 15, 2025, where protesters expressed concerns about Bezalel Smotrich.


## Elaboration
The search results do not provide any information about Bezalel Smotrich being in a bomb shelter on August 25, 2024. The provided evidence mentions attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and also mentions Bezalel Smotrich's involvement in discussions about bomb shelters. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the August 25, 2024 attacks. The search results mention attacks in October 2024 and a protest on August 15, 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the August 25, 2024 attacks. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While the image depicts Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during those attacks.
