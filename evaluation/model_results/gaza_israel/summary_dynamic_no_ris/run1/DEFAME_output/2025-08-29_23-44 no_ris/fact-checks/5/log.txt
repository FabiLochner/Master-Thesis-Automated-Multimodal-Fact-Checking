Content: The 2006 Lebanon War was a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that took place from July 12 to August 14, 2006. The war began with a Hezbollah cross-border raid on July 12, 2006, in which Hezbollah ambushed Israeli soldiers, killing three and capturing two. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon, and launched a ground invasion of Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel and engaged in guerrilla warfare. The war ended with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for the disarmament of Hezbollah and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The conflict resulted in casualties on both sides and caused significant damage to infrastructure. The article mentions that one Israeli helicopter was shot down during the war. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-is-not-of-an-israeli-helicopter-shot-down-in-southern-lebanon-cc0e6543a1f2): 
Content: PesaCheck published on December 3, 2024, fact-checking a post claiming an Israeli helicopter was shot down in southern Lebanon. The image in the post shows an Israeli helicopter shooting flares over the Gaza Strip in March 2019. The image was published by the Times of Israel and credited to Mohammed Abed/AFP. The search for media reports of an Israeli helicopter being shot down yielded no credible reports.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/footage-shows-hezbollah-drone-from-lebanon-being-shot-down-by-iaf-helicopter-south-of-haifa/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that on November 2, 2024, an Israeli Air Force attack helicopter shot down a Hezbollah drone in the Binyamina area, south of Haifa. The article includes a video of the event.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-post-claiming-israeli-helicopter-shot-down-in-lebanon-is-misleading/): 
Content: NewsMobile published a fact-check on November 28, 2024, stating that an image claiming to show an Israeli helicopter shot down in Lebanon is misleading. The image actually shows an Israeli helicopter deploying flares over the Gaza Strip on March 25, 2019. <image:8424> The report mentions a Facebook post with the misleading claim. The fact-check used reverse image search and found reports from The Times of Israel and Arab News that included the same image.

The claim '<image:6> This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image shows an Israeli helicopter deploying flares over the Gaza Strip in March 2019, not being shot down in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024, as confirmed by fact-checks from [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-is-not-of-an-israeli-helicopter-shot-down-in-southern-lebanon-cc0e6543a1f2) and [NewsMobile](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-post-claiming-israeli-helicopter-shot-down-in-lebanon-is-misleading/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
