Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Israel-Iran_war): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Iran–Israel war, which occurred in June 2025. The war began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on June 13, 2025. <image:32>
The article mentions that the war resulted in casualties, including military leaders, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The article also mentions that the IAEA stated that a centrifuge workshop in the nuclear research complex in Isfahan was destroyed by the Israeli strikes.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-special-report-iraq-after-israel-iran-war-june-13-july-3-2025): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a report on July 3, 2025, titled "Iran Update Special Report: Iraq after the Israel-Iran War, June 13 - July 3, 2025." The report discusses the political pressure exerted by Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia actors on the Iraqi government regarding US and Israeli operations in Iraqi airspace. The report also mentions the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) and the upcoming parliamentary elections in November 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2025-07/will-israel-strike-irans-nuclear-facilities-with-us-support/): 
Content: The Bulletin published an article on July 15, 2025, titled "The lead-up to war: Will Israel strike Iran’s nuclear facilities with US support?" <image:8758>. The article mentions a New York Times article from April 16, 2025, about Trump opposing an Israeli strike on Iran.

The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence does not provide sufficient information to verify the claim. While the image is associated with the 2025 Israel-Iran war, there is no information about the baby's identity, injuries, or the circumstances of the alleged airstrike. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
