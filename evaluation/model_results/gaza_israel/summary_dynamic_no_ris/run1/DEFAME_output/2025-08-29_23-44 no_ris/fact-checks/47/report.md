## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in September 2024, JetBlue's in-flight map inaccurately depicted Israel's borders and labeled the area as "Palestinian Territories." The Golan Heights was also removed from Israel's borders. The incident was reported by multiple news sources, including The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel. JetBlue attributed the error to a third-party map provider and subsequently changed its maps.


## Final Judgement
The claim is accurate. Multiple reliable sources confirm that JetBlue's in-flight map in September 2024 mislabeled Israel as "Palestinian Territories."
