## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include articles discussing Keir Starmer's statements on the conflict in Gaza. One article from map.org.uk, published on October 30, 2024, reports that Starmer stated that Israel is exterminating Palestinians in Gaza, but does not mention a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). Another article from The Guardian, published on October 6, 2024, discusses Starmer's call for a ceasefire in Gaza and his urging for unity in Britain (![image 1011](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006106-695473.jpg), ![image 1012](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006107-233228.jpg), ![image 1010](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006104-876764.jpg)).

A BBC article from June 4, 2024, discusses pressure on Starmer to take stronger action against Israel, including sanctions, and shows protesters calling for the UK to sanction Israel (![image 1023](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006112-822136.jpg)). The BBC article mentions Starmer describing the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeating calls for a ceasefire.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While Keir Starmer has made statements regarding the conflict in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire and describing the situation as "appalling and intolerable," there is no mention of a UK boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024. The evidence includes articles from October 6 and October 30, 2024, which do not mention such a boycott.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Keir Starmer has commented on the conflict in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire. However, none of the provided evidence mentions Starmer stating that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024.

The claim is demonstrably false because the search results do not support the claim. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While Keir Starmer has made statements regarding the conflict in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire, the provided evidence from sources like map.org.uk and The Guardian, published in October 2024, does not mention any UK boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel.
