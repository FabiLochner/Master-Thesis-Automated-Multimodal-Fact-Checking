## Claim

## Actions
```
image_search("girl holding oxygen mask sister ambulance")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/): 
Content: The image is of a Syrian girl holding her sister's oxygen mask. ![image 9075](media/2025-08-30_00-25-1756513532-790426.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Syrian girl holding her sister's oxygen mask, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war. The claim is therefore inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a Syrian girl holding her sister's oxygen mask, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war. The claim misrepresents the origin of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of a Syrian girl holding her sister's oxygen mask, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war, as evidenced by a reverse image search ([Source](https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/)). Therefore, the claim is false.
