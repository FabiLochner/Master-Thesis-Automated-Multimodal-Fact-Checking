Useful result: From [Source](https://www.inew.org/the-use-of-heavy-explosive-weapons-in-israel-and-palestine-must-stop/): 
Content: The search result from inew.org contains an image of an explosion in a city, credited to MAHMOD HAMS. <image:1953>

The claim '<image:35> This image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, and the image is credited to MAHMOD HAMS, who has photographed explosions related to Israeli airstrikes, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image specifically depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on that date.

So, the overall veracity is: false
