The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image was taken in Israel, and a Houthi attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/) and other news outlets. The image is likely related to the aftermath of the attack, but the claim that people are fleeing the airport is not explicitly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
