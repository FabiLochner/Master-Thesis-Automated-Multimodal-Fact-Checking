## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 22, 2024, CNN reported that Kamala Harris was in Maryland and would meet with Benjamin Netanyahu later in the week, with an expected emphasis on ensuring Israel's self-defense (<image:k>). The Washington Post reported that Harris declined to preside over the Senate chamber when Netanyahu addresses Congress.

Al-Monitor also reported on Netanyahu's visit to Washington, mentioning his meeting with Harris (![image 8630](media/2025-08-30_00-00-1756512024-694914.jpg), ![image 8633](media/2025-08-30_00-00-1756512029-139730.jpg), ![image 8634](media/2025-08-30_00-00-1756512029-472303.jpg), ![image 8635](media/2025-08-30_00-00-1756512029-787991.jpg), ![image 8636](media/2025-08-30_00-00-1756512029-924039.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that Kamala Harris was scheduled to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu around July 22, 2024. However, the search results do not include any direct quotes from Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue."

To verify the claim, I need to find a direct quote from Kamala Harris on July 22, 2024, or around that date, where she explicitly states the U.S. support for Israel will continue.
