Justification: The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack occurred on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, there is no evidence that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in that attack. Halevi served as the Chief of the General Staff until March 5, 2025, and resigned later, as reported by his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi).
