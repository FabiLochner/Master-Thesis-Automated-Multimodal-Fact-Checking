Useful result: From [Source](https://factly.in/an-old-image-from-2020-of-a-damaged-toilet-in-hong-kong-is-falsely-shared-as-a-recent-hezbollah-incident-in-lebanon/): 
Content: The image <image:8317> shows a damaged toilet. The source claims the image is old and from 2020.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows the aftermath of an explosion of a Hezbollah pager in Lebanon in September 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a damaged toilet, but the evidence from a fact-checking source ([Source](https://factly.in/an-old-image-from-2020-of-a-damaged-toilet-in-hong-kong-is-falsely-shared-as-a-recent-hezbollah-incident-in-lebanon/)) indicates that the image is old and unrelated to the alleged event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
