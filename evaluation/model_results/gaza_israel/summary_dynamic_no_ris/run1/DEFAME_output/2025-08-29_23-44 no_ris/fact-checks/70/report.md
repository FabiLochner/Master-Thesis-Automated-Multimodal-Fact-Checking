## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel. According to a Wikipedia article, the attack involved approximately 200 ballistic missiles, and Israel claimed to have shot down most of them, while Iran stated that 90% of its missiles hit their targets. The article also mentions that the US Navy and Jordan reported intercepting missiles. Al Jazeera reports that Iran launched an attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets. CNN also reports on the missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and mentions that the Iron Dome system has been in the headlines.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of missile interceptions during the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel. While the Israeli military claimed to have shot down "most" of the missiles, and the US Navy and Jordan also intercepted missiles, the evidence does not specify the exact percentage of interceptions by the Iron Dome. The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles is not directly supported by the provided sources.

The sources mention that Iran stated that 90% of its missiles hit their targets, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain.

To verify the claim, specific data on the Iron Dome's interception rate during the attack is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the October 1, 2024, Iranian missile attack on Israel. A PBS News article, published on October 2, 2024, states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90% ![image 4514](media/2025-08-23_01-03-1755911006-339463.jpg). A JINSA report from December 6, 2024, specifies that the Iron Dome's interception rate was roughly 90 percent during the attack.

## Elaboration
The evidence now supports the claim. A PBS News article states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90%. A JINSA report specifies that the Iron Dome's interception rate was roughly 90 percent during the attack.


## Final Judgement
The initial search provided conflicting information, but the subsequent search provided evidence supporting the claim. The PBS News article and the JINSA report both state that the Iron Dome's interception rate was approximately 90% during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
The claim is supported by the evidence. A PBS News article ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)) states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90%, and a JINSA report ([https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/October-Missile-Attack-Proves-Costly-for-Iranian-Regime-1.pdf](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/October-Missile-Attack-Proves-Costly-for-Iranian-Regime-1.pdf)) specifies that the Iron Dome's interception rate was roughly 90 percent during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack.
