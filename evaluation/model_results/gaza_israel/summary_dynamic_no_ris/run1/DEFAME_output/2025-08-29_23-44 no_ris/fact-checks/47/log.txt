Justification: In September 2024, JetBlue Airways' in-flight map inaccurately labeled Israel as "Palestinian Territories," as reported by sources like *The Jerusalem Post* ([https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-818656](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-818656)) and *The Times of Israel* ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/air-canada-blames-display-issue-after-in-flight-map-of-israel-relabeled-as-palestinian-territories/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/air-canada-blames-display-issue-after-in-flight-map-of-israel-relabeled-as-palestinian-territories/)). The Golan Heights was also removed from Israel's borders. JetBlue stated the map was provided by a third party and later changed its maps.

So, the overall veracity is: true
