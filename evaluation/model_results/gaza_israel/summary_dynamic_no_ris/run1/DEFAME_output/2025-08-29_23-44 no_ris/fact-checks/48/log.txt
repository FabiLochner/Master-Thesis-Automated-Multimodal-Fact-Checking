Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/g-s1-16958/gaza-ceasefire-talks-israel-hamas): 
Content: NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks. <image:4093>, <image:4092>. The talks are based on a three-phase proposal that President Biden laid out in May. The article mentions that Benjamin Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: While Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire, there is no evidence from sources like Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)) to support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to help Kamala Harris's campaign. Furthermore, Newsweek reported that both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

So, the overall veracity is: false
