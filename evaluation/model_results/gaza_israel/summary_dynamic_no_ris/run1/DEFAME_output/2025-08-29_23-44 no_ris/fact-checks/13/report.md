## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on February 8, 2024, which includes an image of a burning car (![image 5897](media/2025-08-29_19-31-1756495919-561062.jpg)). The Washington Post published an image of a scene in Baghdad (![image 5898](media/2025-08-29_19-32-1756495920-531834.jpg)). The Denver Post published an article about the 20th anniversary of the attack on the UN headquarters in Iraq (![image 5899](media/2025-08-29_19-32-1756495920-800966.jpg)).

The provided sources do not contain information about a US facility attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, or the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Nigeria': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Chile': 0.05, 'Ecuador': 0.03, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Taiwan': 0.03, 'Bangladesh': 0.02, 'Belgium': 0.02, 'Brazil': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search and geolocation results do not support the claim. The image search did not return any results related to the claim. The geolocation results do not point to Baghdad.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

The image search and geolocation results do not support the claim. The image search did not return any results related to the claim. The geolocation results do not point to Baghdad.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE
