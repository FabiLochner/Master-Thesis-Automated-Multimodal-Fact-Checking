## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources state that the image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk (![image 16](media/19.jpg)) is AI-generated. An article from FRANCE 24, published on February 5, 2025, and an article from aol.com, published on February 10, 2025, both report this. The Independent also mentions AI-generated images of Trump and Netanyahu, along with an Elon Musk lookalike, in a video shared by Trump.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The NPR article includes a photo of Elon Musk (![image 3198](media/2025-08-02_21-26-1754169988-953931.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an image of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 3199](media/2025-08-02_21-26-1754169989-168939.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including FRANCE 24 and aol.com, state that the image is AI-generated. The Independent also mentions AI-generated images of Trump and Netanyahu, along with an Elon Musk lookalike.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence indicates that the image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk is AI-generated, and therefore not authentic. This is supported by multiple sources, including FRANCE 24 and aol.com.
