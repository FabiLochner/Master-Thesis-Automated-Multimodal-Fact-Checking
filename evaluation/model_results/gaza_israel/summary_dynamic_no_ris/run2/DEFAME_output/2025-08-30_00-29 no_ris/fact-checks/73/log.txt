Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on December 8, 2024, about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights. The article includes an image of an Israeli tank. <image:9744>

The claim '<image:45> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image shows Israeli tanks, and there were reports of Israeli military actions in Syria, including airstrikes on Damascus, there is no evidence to support the claim that the Israeli army reached Damascus in December 2024. A fact-check by NDTV ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-israeli-tanks-spotted-outside-damascus-a-fact-check-7224391](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-israeli-tanks-spotted-outside-damascus-a-fact-check-7224391)) determined a similar claim to be false.
