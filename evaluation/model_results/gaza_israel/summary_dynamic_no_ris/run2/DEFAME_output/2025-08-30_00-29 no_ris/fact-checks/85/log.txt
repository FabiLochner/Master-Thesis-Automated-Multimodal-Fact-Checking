Content: The search result from AFP Malaysia states that the image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12.

The altered image, which was shared on social media, presented a question about whether a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner. Channel 12 has debunked the false posts. <image:9873>, <image:9861>, <image:9872>. The article was published on September 4, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza): 
Content: The search result from The National Desk (TND) discusses a doctored image of a poll, falsely attributed to Israel's Channel 12, claiming that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians. The article mentions that the image was shared by Noura Erakat and Rep. Rashida Tlaib. The original poll, conducted by Channel 12 in 2022, addressed the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters." The article was published on August 9, 2024. <image:9878>

Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/): 
Content: The search result from Mondoweiss.net, published on August 19, 2024, discusses a poll showing that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll was published by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies. The article also mentions a Channel 12 report.

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, as confirmed by the channel itself and other sources like The National Desk (TND). The original poll, conducted on May 27, 2022, addressed a different topic than the one presented in the altered image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
