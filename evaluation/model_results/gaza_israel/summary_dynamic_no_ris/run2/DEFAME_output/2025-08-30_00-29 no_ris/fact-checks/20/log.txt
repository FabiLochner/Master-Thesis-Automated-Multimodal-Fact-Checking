The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **unproven**. While a Washington Post analysis suggests the possibility of the funding, CNN reports no evidence for the story, and USAID spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the relevant fiscal years. Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim, and a review of USAID data showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza.

So, the overall veracity is: false
