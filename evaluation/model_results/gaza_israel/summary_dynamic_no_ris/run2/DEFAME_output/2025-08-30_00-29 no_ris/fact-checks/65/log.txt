Useful result: From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261): 
Content: The UN News article, published on March 19, 2025, reports an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, on Wednesday, March 19, 2025. The explosion killed at least one UN staff member and injured at least five others. The article mentions that the Israeli military has denied attacking the compound. The article also states that the UN chief condemned the attacks. <image:9672>

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While evidence confirms Israeli bombardment and casualties in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, in March 2025, the exact number of Palestinian casualties (at least four) is not explicitly verified by the provided sources, although the UN News article mentions at least one death and five injuries.

So, the overall veracity is: false
