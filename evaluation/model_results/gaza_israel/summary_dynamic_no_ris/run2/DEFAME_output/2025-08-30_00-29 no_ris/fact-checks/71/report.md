## Claim
Claim: "![image 43](media/71.jpg) This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor."

## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 43](media/71.jpg))
web_search("Merkava tank vegetable stand Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.26, 'Ukraine': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.11, 'Tunisia': 0.07, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Macedonia': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL fact-check from February 3, 2025, states that the image (![image 43](media/71.jpg)) does not show an Israeli Merkava tank in Gaza, but a Syrian T-55 tank in Syria. The Merkava tank is a main battle tank used by the Israel Defense Forces since 1979 and has been used in the Gaza War. The Defense Post published an article on August 22, 2025, discussing Israel's plan to increase production of its ground combat fleet, including the Merkava tank, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a Merkava tank in Gaza is incorrect. The AOL fact-check states that the image shows a Syrian T-55 tank in Syria. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine, but the tank is not a Merkava. The Merkava tank is used by the Israeli army, and the Defense Post article discusses Israel's plan to increase production of its ground combat fleet, including the Merkava tank, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image does not show a Merkava tank in Gaza, but a Syrian T-55 tank in Syria. The claim is therefore false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, as indicated by an AOL fact-check ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html)). The Merkava tank is used by the Israeli army, and the image's geolocation data suggests it was not taken in Gaza.
