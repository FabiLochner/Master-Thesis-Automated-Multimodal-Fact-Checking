## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12 (![image 54](media/85.jpg)). The original video, published on May 27, 2022, featured a different question. The altered image, which was shared on social media, presented a question about whether a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner. Channel 12 has debunked the false posts. The National Desk (TND) discusses a doctored image of a poll, falsely attributed to Israel's Channel 12, claiming that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians. The original poll, conducted by Channel 12 in 2022, addressed the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters."

The search result from Mondoweiss.net discusses a poll showing that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll was published by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies. The article also mentions a Channel 12 report.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, conducted on May 27, 2022, addressed a different topic.


## Final Judgement
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, conducted on May 27, 2022, addressed a different topic. The altered image presented a false question about whether a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, as confirmed by the channel itself and other sources like The National Desk (TND). The original poll, conducted on May 27, 2022, addressed a different topic than the one presented in the altered image.
