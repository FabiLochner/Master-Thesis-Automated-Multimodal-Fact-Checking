## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) reported on January 1, 2025, that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed. The current population is 2.1 million. The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) also reported a 6% decline, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), with about 160,000 fewer people.

Conversely, the New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA) ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) stated that the population in Gaza increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. ![image 1632](media/2025-07-20_10-38-1753007935-200533.jpg) ![image 1646](media/2025-07-20_10-39-1753007954-541099.jpg) <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip)) estimates the population of Gaza to be around 2,050,000 in 2025 and mentions a 6% decline in population since the start of the war <image:k>. Statista ([https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/](https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/)) reports a population of 2.1 million and mentions the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, stating that since November 19, an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza have become internally displaced refugees ![image 1705](media/2025-07-20_10-43-1753008184-681664.jpg), and provides data on casualties since October 7, 2023 ![image 1704](media/2025-07-20_10-43-1753008184-512134.jpg).

World Population Review ([https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza)) estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. Some sources, such as CNN and The Times of Israel, report a population decrease of 6% since October 7, 2023. However, the NYCFPA states an increase of 2.02% during the same period, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. Other sources like Wikipedia and Statista also mention a population decline. World Population Review estimates a 2.84% annual growth, but the provided estimate for the 2025 population is significantly lower than other sources.

The claim's veracity is uncertain due to the conflicting data. The NYCFPA's claim is based on growth forecasts, which may not reflect the actual population changes due to the war.

To verify the claim, more recent and reliable population data, accounting for deaths, emigration, and internal displacement, is needed.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. Some sources indicate a decrease, while others suggest an increase based on growth forecasts. Given the conflicting data and the need for more reliable, up-to-date information, the claim cannot be definitively verified.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is disputed. While the New York City Foreign Policy Association ([NYCFPA](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) states an increase of 2.02% based on growth forecasts, other sources like CNN and The Times of Israel report a population decrease of 6% since October 7, 2023, due to the ongoing conflict.
