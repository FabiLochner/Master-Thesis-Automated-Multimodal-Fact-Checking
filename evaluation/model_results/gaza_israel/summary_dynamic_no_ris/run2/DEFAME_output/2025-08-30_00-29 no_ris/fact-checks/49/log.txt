The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**.

Although the sentiment of the claim aligns with Harris's statements, the specific date is inaccurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
