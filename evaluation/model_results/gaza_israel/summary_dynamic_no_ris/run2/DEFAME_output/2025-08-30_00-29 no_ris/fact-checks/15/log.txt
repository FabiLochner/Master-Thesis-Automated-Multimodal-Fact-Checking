The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, which was confirmed by multiple sources, including the CBC and the Montreal Gazette ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809), [https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans)). However, the signs were altered at construction sites, and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism, with no evidence suggesting the message was authorized by Mayor Valérie Plante.

So, the overall veracity is: false
