Useful result: From [Source](https://my.rusi.org/resource/why-israel-and-iran-had-decided-to-avoid-a-long-war.html):

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israel-asked-us-to-join-military-campaign-against-iran-but-us-rejects-request/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Israel asked the United States to join its military campaign against Iran, but the US is not considering such a move. The article mentions that Israel sought US assistance to destroy Iranâ€™s underground Fordo uranium enrichment site. <image:9576>

The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported by the evidence. While the initial search did not support the claim, subsequent searches revealed that the U.S. Justice Department charged three men in an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump and kill Jewish Americans, and that Israel sought U.S. involvement in a military campaign against Iran, which the U.S. declined ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israel-asked-us-to-join-military-campaign-against-iran-but-us-rejects-request/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israel-asked-us-to-join-military-campaign-against-iran-but-us-rejects-request/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
