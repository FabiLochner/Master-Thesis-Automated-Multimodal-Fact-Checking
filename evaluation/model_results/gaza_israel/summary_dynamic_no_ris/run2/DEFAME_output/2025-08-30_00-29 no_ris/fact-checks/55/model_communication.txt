Former President Donald J. Trump’s strong support for Israel has been central to his campaign, highlighting past achievements like relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, and brokering the Abraham Accords, but polls show that reoccupation of the Gaza Strip would be a far less popular policy among Israelis and American supporters of the Jewish state.

In the interview, Hewitt asked Trump if Gaza could be transformed into a prosperous area like Monaco. The remark came during a conversation with conservative host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, which marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Trump, the Republican nominee in this year’s US presidential election, claimed in a recent radio interview that he had visited Gaza, a war-torn region he has never officially been recorded visiting. When asked for clarification, a campaign aide asserted that Gaza is “in Israel” and noted that Trump had visited Israel.

The Gaza Strip, under Hamas control since 2007, is not claimed by Israel, though it was under Israeli military administration from 1967 to 2005. Despite some Israeli calls for its annexation, Gaza remains distinct, separated from Israel and the West Bank. Trump responded, “It could be better than Monaco. You know when—I’ve been there, and it’s rough.”

* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:31> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people."

## Actions
```
image_search("exploded iphone lebanon september 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of an exploded iPhone (<image:9600>). An article from India Today discusses explosions of Hezbollah devices in Lebanon and includes images of exploded devices (<image:9601>).

DW.com states that the claim is false and shows a post about sabotaged solar panels in Lebanon that have started significant electrical fires (<image:9602>).

## Elaboration
The claim is false. While the search results confirm that explosions of devices, including iPhones, occurred in Lebanon, the evidence indicates that the explosions were not the primary cause of injury. DW.com explicitly labels the claim as false and attributes the injuries to sabotaged solar panels.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. While the image of an exploded iPhone is present, the primary cause of injuries in Lebanon was due to sabotaged solar panels, not exploding iPhones. `false`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("burning tank Israeli army")
geolocate(<image:34>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9603>). The website vpk.name also shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9604>).

The source kashif.ps discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank (<image:9605>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.

They said that the smell of death is in every corner of the Jabalia refugee camp,” he added.

“We have to remember that Jabalia is already under a crippling siege with no food and water entering the area for the 15th day now,” Abu Azzoum said.![INTERACTIVE-LIVE-TRACKER-GAZA_1400GMT-2024_1080x1350](/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/INTERACTIVE-LIVE-TRACKER-GAZA_LEBANON-OCT16_2024_1400GMT-2024_1080x1350-GAZA-1729263613.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C963&quality=80)

Communications and internet services had also been completely been cut off, disrupting rescue operations, he said, adding that Israeli forces have been advancing further into the centre of Jabalia and fighting with Hamas forces.

Meanwhile, Palestinian authorities warned the death toll from the latest strikes on Jabalia could rise, as some people were believed to be still trapped under the rubble.

Three partially functioning hospitals treating severely wounded patients and sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza are now out of service after coming under intense Israeli fire, a Gaza health official told Al Jazeera, as [the siege on Jabalia](/news/2024/10/12/several-killed-in-israeli-strikes-on-northern-gazas-jabalia)
 enters its third week, with at least 33 more people killed in the northern area.

[Israeli forces](/news/liveblog/2024/10/19/live-israeli-attack-kills-at-least-33-in-north-gazas-jabalia-refugee-camp)
 bombed al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia early on Saturday, and have also shelled Kamal Adwan and the Indonesian hospitals in Beit Lahiya over the past few hours, Al Jazeera correspondents have reported.

“We cannot count the number of those killed. Witnesses also told Abu Azzoum the situation in other parts of Jabalia had “severely deteriorated” since Friday.

“They said that they are surrounded by Israeli tanks and that destruction is everywhere. At least 85 others were wounded, some critically, raising fears of more fatalities.

The Israeli military said its operation in Jabalia is intended to stop Hamas fighters regrouping for more attacks. The numbers are terrifying,” the official told Al Jazeera.

At least one person has been killed and several others were wounded in the strike at the entrance of the laboratory of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.

The Palestinian news agency Wafa also reported that because of the military siege, two intensive care unit patients at the Indonesian Hospital have died on Saturday.

In another Israeli attack on central Gaza’s Maghazi refugee camp, at least 16 people were killed, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said on Saturday, adding that there are still missing people under the rubble.

At least seven people were also reported killed in a separate Israeli strike on a school sheltering Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp, just west of Jabalia. In Jabalia itself, an air strike on Saturday afternoon killed five more people.

Another four people were reported killed in another Israeli strike in al-Nuseirat refugee camp, according to our Al Jazeera team from Gaza.

In Rafah city, southern Gaza Strip, two people were killed in an Israeli drone airstrike on the Khirbet area.

In all, the death toll has surpassed the 67 killed in [Israeli attacks across Gaza](/tag/israel-palestine-conflict/)
 in the last 24 hours, as earlier reported by health authorities in the enclave. At least 450 have been killed since the siege began two weeks ago.

Al Jazeera’s Tarek Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said witnesses in northern Gaza told him the second and third floors of the Indonesian Hospital, as well as its courtyard, have been hit, resulting in “a number of casualties”.

At least 40 patients are trapped inside the hospital and Israeli tanks have surrounded it, he said.

Meanwhile, the attack on al-Awda Hospital cut power to the medical facility."

CAIRO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Israeli military strikes killed at least 50 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces tightened their squeeze around Jabalia in the north of the enclave on Tuesday, amid fierce battles with Hamas-led fighters.

Palestinian health officials said at least 17 people were killed by Israeli fire near Al-Falouja in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, while 10 others were killed in Bani Suhaila in eastern Khan Younis in the south when an Israeli missile struck a house.

Earlier on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike destroyed three houses in the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, and the local civil emergency service said they recovered two bodies from the site, while the search continued for 12 other people who were believed to have been in the houses at the time.

Eight others were killed when a house was struck in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.

The Gaza health ministry said one doctor was killed when he tried to help people wounded by Israeli strikes in Al-Falouja in Jabalia. It said it was facilitating humanitarian, and in particular medical aid to residents.

Hamas denies it embeds its operatives amongst civilians.

JABALIA ENCIRCLED
-----------------

The Israeli military has now encircled the Jabalia camp and sent tanks into nearby Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun towns, with the declared aim of stamping out Hamas fighters who are trying to regroup there.

The Israeli military has told residents to leave their homes and head to safety in southern Gaza. It added that several medics were wounded when their ambulance came under Israeli fire in the northern and southern Gaza Strip.

Jabalia has been the focus of an Israeli offensive for more than 10 days, with troops returning to areas of the north that came under [heavy bombardment](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/ANNIVERSARY-GAZA-RUBBLE/akveegbnlvr/)
 in the early months of the [year-long war.](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)

The operation has raised concerns among Palestinians and U.N. Residents said Israeli forces destroyed dozens of houses in the past 10 days.

On Tuesday, the Israeli military said troops had killed dozens of fighters in the Jabalia area over the past day, including a unit that fired an anti-tank missile at them.

The United Nations human rights office said the Israeli military appeared to be "cutting off North Gaza completely from the rest of the Gaza Strip."

"Gaza families are facing unimaginable fear, loss of loved ones, confusion, and exhaustion. officials say there is no safe place in Gaza.

Hamas' armed wing said fighters were engaged in fierce battles with Israeli forces in and around Jabalia.

Gaza's health ministry said the army ordered the three hospitals operating there to evacuate but medical staffers said they were determined to continue their services.

Cogat said in recent days it had facilitated the transfer of 33 patients, medical staff and accompanying personnel from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north to functioning facilities elsewhere in Gaza.

It said it has also provided 68,650 litres of fuel to hospitals and coordinated the delivery of 800 blood transfusion units.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said Israel was trying to give a misleading impression and that its forces had been preventing ambulance and civil emergency teams from recovering the bodies of dozens of people from the streets.

Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the three hospitals in northern Gaza, said they were facing serious shortages of food, medication, and fuel, that could soon impact patients in their facilities.

"There is a stark shortage of consumables and supplies began to run out. People must be able to flee safely, without facing further danger," Adrian Zimmerman,

ICRC Gaza head of sub-delegation, said in a statement.

The Israeli military's administrative unit, Cogat, which oversees aid and commercial shipments to Gaza, said on Tuesday that operations in Jabalia were targeting terrorist infrastructure and operatives embedded inside civilian areas. Around 400,000 people remain, according to United Nations estimates.

Israel launched the offensive against Hamas after the militant group's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage to Gaza, by Israeli tallies."

Earlier this evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting to discuss increasing humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip, Reuters and Israel's Channel 13 News are reporting.

    Following Netanyahu's meeting, three Israeli officials told Reuters aid is expected to increase in the near future. They also rely on the **Kerem Shalom crossing**, near Egypt.
    
    Two other crossings - **Erez** in the north, and **Rafah** in the south - **are closed**.

Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9603>). The website vpk.name also shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9604>).

The source kashif.ps discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank (<image:9605>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.

The IDF blocked the [Salah al-Din Road](/wiki/Salah_al-Din_Road "Salah al-Din Road")
, a major thoroughfare connecting the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. But it also noted that the rate of Hamas deaths was falling as Hamas reduced head-on assaults against the IDF and became more reliant on underground tunnels.[\[445\]](#cite_note-453)

During the invasion of the Gaza strip, Palestinians fighting against the Israeli occupation damaged or destroyed a large number of Israeli tanks, causing a shortage of both tanks and ammunition for the IDF.[\[446\]](#cite_note-454)

Background
----------

Main article: [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")

Further information: [Gaza–Israel conflict](/wiki/Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict "Gaza–Israel conflict")

See also: [Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip (2023–present)](/wiki/Israeli_blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_(2023%E2%80%93present) "Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip (2023–present)")
 and [Evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip](/wiki/Evacuation_of_the_northern_Gaza_Strip "Evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip")

After Palestinian militant groups led by [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 launched an [attack on Israel](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
 on 7 October 2023 which saw a minimum of 1,139 largely non-combatant individuals killed, Israel [declared war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 against Hamas.[\[127\]](#cite_note-135)
 Israel moved to mobilize 300,000 [reservists](/wiki/Reserve_duty_(Israel) "Reserve duty (Israel)")
 and began to move armor close to the border with the Gaza Strip in the aftermath.[\[128\]](#cite_note-136)
[\[129\]](#cite_note-Sharma_2023-137)
 Included in the amassing of armor were [Namer](/wiki/Namer "Namer")
 armored personnel carriers and [Merkava](/wiki/Merkava "Merkava")
 tanks.[\[129\]](#cite_note-Sharma_2023-137)

Before the raids, Israel had told the UN that the more than a million people living in the north half of the Gaza Strip should evacuate within a 24-hour window.[\[130\]](#cite_note-138)
 In response, Hamas instructed those residents to stay put.[\[131\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[132\]](#cite_note-Ward_2023-140)
 The [Israel Defense Forces](/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces")
 (IDF) had urged around 1.1 million civilians to leave [North Gaza](/wiki/North_Gaza_Governorate "North Gaza Governorate")
 so they would not be hurt or caught in crossfire,[\[133\]](#cite_note-141)
 and Israeli officials said that the window was left at 24-hours to reduce the time for Hamas to conduct military preparation in the area. Anyone who chooses not to evacuate from the North of the Gaza Strip to the South of the Gaza Strip may be identified as a partner in a terrorist organization."[\[135\]](#cite_note-143)
[\[136\]](#cite_note-144)

### Raids inside Gaza

On 13 October 2023, the IDF sent armored vehicles and infantry into the Gaza Strip, stating that their goals were to attack Hamas fighters[\[137\]](#cite_note-toilb13oct-145)
 and to rescue hostages that had been abducted to Gaza by Hamas.[\[137\]](#cite_note-toilb13oct-145)
[\[138\]](#cite_note-146)
 The operation, according to Israeli officials, was not part of a larger and widely anticipated ground invasion, but rather a raid in which troops only temporarily enter the Gaza Strip.[\[139\]](#cite_note-147)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-148)
 The IDF confirmed the same day that Israeli remains were located and retrieved in the Gaza Strip.[\[141\]](#cite_note-149)

Another raid, headed by the [Givati Brigade](/wiki/Givati_Brigade "Givati Brigade")
 and the [162nd Armoured Division](/wiki/162nd_Division_(Israel) "162nd Division (Israel)")
, took place between 25 and 26 October and was the largest offensive so far,[\[142\]](#cite_note-toi26oct-150)
 including tanks, other vehicles and [IDF Caterpillar D9](/wiki/IDF_Caterpillar_D9 "IDF Caterpillar D9")
 armored bulldozers.[\[143\]](#cite_note-151)
 A follow-up raid took place the next night in the [Shuja'iyya](/wiki/Shuja%27iyya "Shuja'iyya")
 neighborhood of Gaza City.[\[144\]](#cite_note-152)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("burning tank Israeli army")

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9603>). The website vpk.name also shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9604>).

The source kashif.ps discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank (<image:9605>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.

UN mission says Israeli tanks forcibly entered base in southern Lebanon

Unifil seeks explanation from IDF for ‘shocking violations’ while Netanyahu urges peacekeepers to withdraw

The UN peacekeeping mission in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 has said two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a base in the south of the country as Israel’s ground operation against Hezbollah moved deeper into Lebanese territory.

The incident in Ramyah on Sunday morning was the latest in a string of violations that Unifil, the UN force deployed since 1978 to southern Lebanon, has blamed on the [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 Defense Forces (IDF).

After the tanks left, shells exploded about 100 metres from the base, and the ensuing smoke left 15 staffers needing medical treatment for unusual symptoms despite the use of gas masks. The UN fired nine staff members implicated in the 7 October attack but an investigation stressed that Israel had not provided evidence for its main allegations.

Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, reiterated on Sunday that Guterres was barred from entering the country due to what Katz described as “antisemitic and anti-Israel conduct”.

 entered a second week. The World Food Programme, the UN food agency, reported on Saturday that no food aid had reached northern Gaza since 1 October, raising new fears of famine and extreme hunger.

An Israeli strike on the central town of Deir al-Balah on Sunday killed a family of eight, local medics said.

The region is still bracing for an anticipated Israeli response to an unprecedented missile attack by Iran two weeks ago, launched in support of its Lebanese ally after Israel’s ground invasion.

NBC reported on Saturday that US officials believed Israel had narrowed down targets to military and energy infrastructure. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

An Israeli tank entering Lebanon from northern Israel at the Naqoura border point on Sunday. Unifil also accused the Israeli military of holding up a logistics convoy.

In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally.

Five peacekeepers have been injured since Friday as Israeli ground troops have begun to advance farther north in Lebanon after two weeks of intense fighting and airstrikes. They may constitute a war crime,” he said.

Israel argues that Unifil has failed in its mission to uphold a UN resolution from two decades ago that was supposed to ensure that Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-allied Lebanese militia, withdrew from the border area.

In the three weeks since a year of tit-for-tat cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah escalated into all-out war, the 10,000-strong Unifil force from 50 different countries has refused to leave 29 positions across southern Lebanon, citing the same UN resolution, which ensures freedom of movement for its staff.

Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on medics and first responders as well as Unifil peacekeepers since Israel invaded Lebanon on 1 October, amid [growing international opprobrium](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/italian-pm-tells-netanyahu-attacks-on-un-peacekeepers-unacceptable/)
.

Hezbollah had begun firing on Israel the day after Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the new war, ostensibly in solidarity with the Palestinian group. The US, Israel’s staunch ally, is [wary of being drawn into the fighting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/what-are-the-risks-involved-in-israeli-options-for-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran)
 and of negative impacts on the global oil industry.

In a social media post, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on Sunday there were “no red lines” for Tehran on the issue of defending itself, and indirectly threatened US forces against operating in Israel.

“The US has been delivering record amount of arms to Israel,” he said on X."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was fighting in and around Jabalia in October 2024, including an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. The evidence also shows that Israeli tanks were involved in the conflict. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews. While the evidence confirms that there was an ambush and fighting in the area, it does not provide any information about the specific tank in the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("burning tank Israeli army")
geolocate(<image:34>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9603>). The website vpk.name also shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9604>).

The source kashif.ps discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank (<image:9605>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_North_Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_North_Gaza)) discusses the Siege of North Gaza, which began on October 5, 2024, and mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-under-israeli-fire-as-jabalia-attack-kills-33](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-under-israeli-fire-as-jabalia-attack-kills-33)) reports on an Israeli army operation in the Jabalia refugee camp on October 18, 2024, and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-kills-least-40-gaza-tanks-deepen-raid-north-2024-10-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-kills-least-40-gaza-tanks-deepen-raid-north-2024-10-15/)) reports on October 15, 2024, about Israeli strikes and fierce battles with Hamas-led fighters in and around Jabalia. The Al Jazeera article includes images of the destruction in Jabalia (<image:9606>, <image:9607>), and the Reuters article includes an image of a tent camp (<image:9643>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwdx0y5nj9t](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwdx0y5nj9t)) reports on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, including the rate of lorries entering Gaza up to October 2024 (<image:9668>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran)) published an article on October 13, 2024, discussing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including fighting in the Jabaliya area of Gaza City (<image:9769>, <image:9768>). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip)) discusses the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began on October 27, 2023, and mentions the destruction of Israeli tanks.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was fighting in and around Jabalia in October 2024, including an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. The evidence also shows that Israeli tanks were involved in the conflict. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews. While the evidence confirms that there was an ambush and fighting in the area, it does not provide any information about the specific tank in the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("burning tank Israeli army")
geolocate(<image:34>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9603>). The website vpk.name also shows an image of a burning tank (<image:9604>).

The source kashif.ps discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank (<image:9605>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_North_Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_North_Gaza)) discusses the Siege of North Gaza, which began on October 5, 2024, and mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-under-israeli-fire-as-jabalia-attack-kills-33](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-under-israeli-fire-as-jabalia-attack-kills-33)) reports on an Israeli army operation in the Jabalia refugee camp on October 18, 2024, and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-kills-least-40-gaza-tanks-deepen-raid-north-2024-10-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-kills-least-40-gaza-tanks-deepen-raid-north-2024-10-15/)) reports on October 15, 2024, about Israeli strikes and fierce battles with Hamas-led fighters in and around Jabalia. The Al Jazeera article includes images of the destruction in Jabalia (<image:9606>, <image:9607>), and the Reuters article includes an image of a tent camp (<image:9643>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwdx0y5nj9t](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwdx0y5nj9t)) reports on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, including the rate of lorries entering Gaza up to October 2024 (<image:9668>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran)) published an article on October 13, 2024, discussing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including fighting in the Jabaliya area of Gaza City (<image:9769>, <image:9768>). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip)) discusses the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began on October 27, 2023, and mentions the destruction of Israeli tanks.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was fighting in and around Jabalia in October 2024, including an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. The evidence also shows that Israeli tanks were involved in the conflict. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews. While the evidence confirms that there was an ambush and fighting in the area, it does not provide any information about the specific tank in the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.

Published On 6 Oct 20246 Oct 2024

The Israeli military has carried out intense bombardment in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 17 people hours after forcing residents in the area to leave again during its third ground assault on the densely populated camp in northern Gaza since launching the war a year ago.

The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said [on Sunday](/news/liveblog/2024/10/6/live-israel-carries-out-very-violent-bombing-campaign-on-beirut)
 that the death toll included nine children following air attacks and as the army deployed tanks into the area for the first time in months.

The Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson in Gaza, Mahmoud Basal, added that Jabalia was targeted with multiple strikes overnight, resulting in many casualties. This may lead to more civilian deaths and injuries,” he said.

Military and security analyst Elijah Magnier says Israel’s renewed ground invasion of northern Gaza was “inevitable” as far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Palestinian armed resistance groups had recruited “more than a thousand people”.

“Israelis have returned to Gaza several times, they’ve returned to the north several times, they’ve destroyed the infrastructure, the hospitals, everything,” Magnier told Al Jazeera.

“They will continue doing so unless \[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\] Netanyahu stops this war.”

Evacuation orders
-----------------

The Israeli army has called on Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to designated “safe zones” in southern and central Gaza as it begins a renewed ground offensive. It felt like the early days of the war,” Raed, 52, from Jabalia, told the Reuters news agency before his family left for Gaza City on Sunday.

On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said its forces had “successfully” encircled the refugee camp and were operating in the area.

The army said the decision was taken after intelligence indicated the “presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia … as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area”.

Israel has destroyed hospitals, schools and residential areas, claiming Hamas was operating under them but providing no proof of its claims. Residents in Jabalia have described the intensified attacks as some of the worst in months.

“Dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings. Rights organisations say these attacks amount to war crimes.

Meanwhile, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said its fighters have targeted “a command and control room” belonging to Israeli forces who were trying to get into Jabalia refugee camp.

‘Deteriorating’ situation
-------------------------

Reporting from near the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, journalist Moath al-Kahlout said that the situation in the north was “deteriorating”, adding that an “entire family” had been killed in the overnight attacks.

“The Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering people to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. But no place in Gaza is safe for Palestinians, including the so-called “safe zones”, campaigners say.

But as some Palestinians begin making the journey southwards, Gaza’s Interior Ministry has called on residents to ignore Israel’s evacuation orders.

“Israeli claims about the presence of safe zones in southern Gaza are lies as Israel commits crimes and massacres in all areas of the enclave,” the ministry said in a statement.

“We call on citizens in northern Gaza to ignore Israeli threats.”

Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the difference this time, compared to earlier evacuation orders, is that it is “not only blocks but whole areas”.

“Some of those Palestinians who were in the north have refused to evacuate despite the attacks and also the starvation and harsh conditions the blockade has imposed on them. They still refuse to leave,” Khoudary said.

She added that a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also targeted in Sunday’s strikes and was killed.

According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured since the war began on October 7.

Between 10.30am and 11.30am on 9 October last year, five Israeli airstrikes tore through the market, killing dozens of people.

They were the opening salvoes of a devastating Israeli campaign, conducted in three waves, that has left the camp an unrecognisable wasteland of rubble.

“This year is one of the worst I have experienced,” said 33-year-old Ahlam al-Tlouli, who comes from the Tal al-Zaatar area of the camp. The deadliest, on 31 October, [killed scores of people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/jabalia-camp-airstrike-gaza)
 and left large craters in the ground at a busy junction.

Israel said the camp was a command centre for Hamas’s northern brigade and that it had identified Hamas tunnel systems under the camp. “No house, person, tree or stone was spared.”

‘Jabaliya is like hell’
-----------------------

**The third offensive: October 2024 – ongoing**

The heavy damage inflicted on Jabaliya during the second offensive paled in comparison with the destruction levelled since 5 October, when Israeli forces returned in large numbers for a third time.

Over the course of the offensive – which targeted Jabaliya city as well as the camp – whole groupings of buildings have been demolished, replaced in some areas by bulldozed lanes to accommodate Israeli armour and tank berms. In footage posted online in recent weeks, bulldozers and backhoes can be seen pulling down structures.

Some neighbourhoods have almost entirely disappeared, including block 4, which included the camp’s main school complex.

“There are bodies on the roads and under the rubble,” said Mahmoud Basal, 39, a civil defence official. Every minute that passes feels like a year.”

Over the course of the Israeli invasion, settlements across the Gaza Strip have suffered damage.

[Map showing damage to settlements](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/jabailya_locator_update/giv-45592lvKwJoM9WfY/)

This is the story of the ruin of Jabaliya.

‘We were starving and without food’
-----------------------------------

**The first offensive: October 2023 – January** **2024**

Jabaliya was pummelled with airstrikes in the first months of the war. This footage from April shows damage to buildings along two roads in the camp.

On 11 May the IDF reported that Hamas had managed to reconstitute its military capabilities, and it issued a new round of evacuation orders to civilians. Drone footage filmed in June laid bare the extent of the destruction.

Fakhoura district had the worst destruction. At some point during the third offensive the football pitch was cleared out and now appears to host several Israeli military vehicles.

Khaled al-Ayla, a 54-year-old university lecturer, said: “The situation in Jabaliya is like hell. It has an awful momentum.”

Other observers detect a more deliberate agenda in Jabaliya and across northern Gaza: the slow enactment of a scorched earth policy known as the “generals’ plan”, aimed at driving out civilians from areas by declaring them “closed military zones” where anyone who stays is considered a combatant and all aid and other supplies are cut.

Regardless of the intention, whole-scale destruction of neighbourhoods has taken place across the north of Gaza, including in the camp.

[Satellite image of Jabaliya refugee camp from 12 Nov 2024](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/jabaliya_12-nov-2023_tue_final/giv-4559UcmYNSAvUq79)

, talks of “exposing large areas” – a euphemism, the paper says, for destroying buildings and infrastructure in such a way that Hamas fighters cannot hide in them but no one can live in them either.

Nadia Hardman, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said HRW had identified a pattern in Jabaliya and across the north of Israeli forces clearing territory for buffer zones and security corridors.

“People can argue whether the campaign of bombing is reckless destruction or part of the hostilities, but taking control of an area and intentionally destroying it looks far more systematic,” Hardman said.

In a statement, the IDF said: “The IDF is currently operating in northern Gaza against terrorist targets due to Hamas’s efforts to restore its operational capabilities in the area … The IDF targets only military objectives. “Homes, streets, health and educational facilities – everything is gone.”

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-under-israeli-fire-as-jabalia-attack-kills-33](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/hospitals-in-northern-gaza-under-israeli-fire-as-jabalia-attack-kills-33)) reports on an Israeli army operation in the Jabalia refugee camp on October 18, 2024, and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-kills-least-40-gaza-tanks-deepen-raid-north-2024-10-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-kills-least-40-gaza-tanks-deepen-raid-north-2024-10-15/)) reports on October 15, 2024, about Israeli strikes and fierce battles with Hamas-led fighters in and around Jabalia. The Al Jazeera article includes images of the destruction in Jabalia (<image:9606>, <image:9607>), and the Reuters article includes an image of a tent camp (<image:9643>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwdx0y5nj9t](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwdx0y5nj9t)) reports on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, including the rate of lorries entering Gaza up to October 2024 (<image:9668>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran)) published an article on October 13, 2024, discussing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including fighting in the Jabaliya area of Gaza City (<image:9769>, <image:9768>). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip)) discusses the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began on October 27, 2023, and mentions the destruction of Israeli tanks.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was fighting in and around Jabalia in October 2024, including an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. The evidence also shows that Israeli tanks were involved in the conflict. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews. While the evidence confirms that there was an ambush and fighting in the area, it does not provide any information about the specific tank in the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.

While the evidence confirms that there was an ambush and fighting in the area, it does not provide any information about the specific tank in the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters published a photo gallery on October 4, 2024, titled "One year of war in Israel and Gaza," which includes images of the conflict (<image:9772>, <image:9774>, <image:9775>, <image:9776>, <image:9778>, <image:9780>, <image:9782>, <image:9784>, <image:9786>, <image:9787>, <image:9788>, <image:9789>, <image:9790>, <image:9791>, <image:9792>, <image:9793>, <image:9794>, <image:9795>, <image:9796>, <image:9797>, <image:9798>, <image:9799>, <image:9800>, <image:9801>, <image:9802>, <image:9803>, <image:9804>, <image:9805>, <image:9806>, <image:9807>, <image:9808>). Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia on October 5, 2024, including intense bombardment and the deployment of tanks, and includes an image of a wounded Palestinian man in a hospital in Jabalia (<image:9608>).

The Guardian published an article on December 18, 2024, detailing the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, mentioning three offensives by Israeli forces, with the third offensive beginning on October 5, 2024, and ongoing, and includes satellite images and videos showing the destruction in Jabaliya (<image:9606>, <image:9607>, <image:9643>). The article also mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. The evidence also shows that there was intense fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including the deployment of Israeli tanks. However, the evidence does not contain the image of the burning tank.

The claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is about an image of a burning tank, which is not present in the provided evidence. While the evidence confirms that there was fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including an ambush by Hamas, it does not provide any information about the specific tank in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including an ambush by Hamas that destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company, the provided evidence does not include the image of the burning tank mentioned in the claim, nor does it provide details to confirm the specific event depicted in the image.

Content: "<image:4532>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:4533>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:4532>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:4535>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Israelis demonstrate around 27 coffins symbolizing hostages killed in Gaza, as they protest for the release of Israelis held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza, outside the Defense Ministry Headquarters in Tel Aviv, September 5, 2024. <image:4537>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/F240905AVS48.jpg)

Thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv on Thursday, carrying 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in Hamas captivity in Gaza, demanding a deal to secure the remaining hostages’ release. They had been murdered days before Israeli troops reached them, almost 11 months after they’d been kidnapped from Israel during Hamas’s October 7 attack.

News of the hostages’ execution sparked outrage in Israel, and drew charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been refusing to pursue negotiations with Hamas in earnest, avoiding [concessions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/asked-to-decide-between-hostages-or-philadelphi-netanyahu-said-to-prefer-latter/)
 that might have allowed the Israelis to come home alive but would have endangered his ruling coalition.

As protesters in Tel Aviv gathered at Habima Square ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the [six slain hostages](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hersh-carmel-alex-eden-or-almog-the-6-hostages-murdered-by-hamas-just-days-ago/)
, accused Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shouted: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann said, noting the number of days Gat was held captive. (Adar Ayal)

The hostage families and supporters, carrying the caskets, held a mock funeral procession along Begin Street, in the direction of the Begin-Kaplan intersection, in front of the IDF headquarters.

The Tel Aviv thoroughfare has been a locus of demonstrations for a hostage deal and has been blocked by protesters every night since the slain hostages’ bodies were recovered last weekend.

When the 27 coffins arrived at the intersection, the protest began in earnest, swelling to some 2,000 people, who chanted slogans against the government and in favor of a deal.

“We are all hostages of the government of blood!” protesters yelled. <image:4538>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/WhatsApp-Image-2024-09-05-at-21.29.13.jpeg)

Protesters marching in the central Israeli city of Rehovot call for the release of hostages held captive by the Hamas terror group in Gaza. <image:4539>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/F240905AVS15.jpg)

Israelis protest in Tel Aviv with photos of murdered hostages, at a demonstration calling for a deal to secure the release of remaining captives held by the Hamas terror group in Gaza, September 5, 2024. Significant crowds also gathered in Rehovot, Eilat and Jerusalem.

It was the fifth straight night of demonstrations, following the [recovery last Saturday](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-recovers-bodies-of-6-hostages-from-gaza-including-one-previously-presumed-alive/)
 of the bodies of six Israeli hostages. On the other side, cardboard planks spelled out: “Here lie our hostages.”

Inside the crowd, a man in Hasidic garb drew attention and applause as he delivered a philippic against Netanyahu.

“Redeeming the hostages is the entire Torah!” he shouted into a megaphone.

Police arrested six people at the demonstration, according to an organization that represents detained protesters. There was no immediate comment from police.

As the protest wound down, police on horseback rebuffed some 100 protesters who attempted to march outside the demonstration area on Begin Street.

Central Tel Aviv police chief Micah Gafni was seen pushing one protester out of the crowd and snatching his megaphone.

A column of officers later marched into the crowd and confiscated a protester’s drum, eliciting sarcastic applause.

Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, protesters gathered near the homes of Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Knesset Member Aryeh Deri, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, as well as in the city’s central Zion Square.

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

[](#) There were 327 opportunities to bring her back."

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

The image depicts a protest in Israel, as confirmed by the geolocation data.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

  !Smoke rises from an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Saturday. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

[!Palestinians evacuate the Jabalia refugee camp and the Sheikh Radwan and Abu Iskandar neighborhoods in the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday. It later said the military hit its ambulances and courtyard, wounding four people, including a medic.

Three houses in Jabaliya were struck overnight, killing at least 30 people, more than half women and children, said Fares Abu Hamza, head of the health ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. A boy collected body parts on a piece of cardboard.

Elsewhere in central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah."

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

_CNN’s Eyad Kourdi and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting._

Ad Feedback Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel anticipating an attack by Iran and its allies. The USNI News article from August 2, 2024, states that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East to bolster military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. The article also mentions the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August 2024. The evidence also suggests that the U.S. military presence was increased due to the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific reason for the deployment (supporting the IDF) is not directly confirmed by the provided evidence.

The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article, from L'Orient-Le Jour, focuses on this topic and includes an image of a warship (<image:9017>). Another article, from the Associated Press, also discusses U.S. warships and includes an image of a warship (<image:9018>).

A search result from worldview.stratfor.com also contains an image of a U.S. warship (<image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August 2024. The evidence also suggests that the U.S. military presence was increased due to the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific reason for the deployment (supporting the IDF) is not directly confirmed by the provided evidence.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:55>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Singapore': 0.32, 'Malta': 0.15, 'France': 0.1, 'South Korea': 0.07, 'Malaysia': 0.06, 'Taiwan': 0.04, 'Monaco': 0.03, 'Croatia': 0.02, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Bermuda': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis of the image suggests that it was most likely taken in Singapore, Malta, or France. This contradicts the claim that the image shows warships en route to the Lebanon coast. The evidence indicates that the image's location is not consistent with the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image was not taken near the Lebanon coast, as the geolocation analysis suggests locations like Singapore, Malta, or France. While there is evidence of U.S. warships in the Eastern Mediterranean in August 2024, the image's location contradicts the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel anticipating an attack by Iran and its allies. The USNI News article from August 2, 2024, states that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East to bolster military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. The article also mentions the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, with approximately 40,000 forces, a dozen warships, and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons. The article mentions that the U.S. has warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including the USS Wasp, due to the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>, <image:9009>

## Actions
```
image_search("Esmail Qaani hijab")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor published an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7800>). The Times of Israel published an image of a woman holding a picture of Iranian leaders (<image:7801>). Fox News provides an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7802>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes multiple images of Esmail Qaani, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results do not provide any information about Qaani wearing a hijab. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine, but this does not confirm the claim.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is Esmail Qaani and if the context of the image is as described in the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image was most likely taken in Israel. The web search confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the attack caused people to flee the airport. The Reuters article mentions a drone strike, and The Guardian article mentions safety instructions, but neither confirms the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the Houthi attack.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, which killed one man and wounded four others. <image:2525>

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also report on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. <image:2533> The Guardian article mentions police urging residents to "respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives".


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. The web search confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the attack caused people to flee the airport. The Reuters article mentions a drone strike, and The Guardian article mentions safety instructions, but neither confirms the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the Houthi attack.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also report on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. <image:2533> The Guardian article mentions police urging residents to "respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives".


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. The web search confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the attack caused people to flee the airport. The Reuters article mentions a drone strike, and The Guardian article mentions safety instructions, but neither confirms the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the Houthi attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport" states that on May 4, 2025, the Houthi movement fired a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv, Israel, hitting the perimeter of Ben Gurion Airport's main terminal. The attack caused air traffic to stop and several major airlines to cancel their flights for a few days. The article also mentions that the attack was the first time a missile landed so close to Israel's main airport.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides conflicting information. The Wikipedia article mentions a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, but the date is May 4, 2025, which contradicts the claim's date of July 19, 2024. The image search results show a crowded airport, but the context is not related to the Houthi attack.

Therefore, the claim is still not fully verifiable. The evidence suggests a Houthi attack on an airport, but the dates and specific events are inconsistent with the claim. More specific evidence is needed to confirm the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport" states that on May 4, 2025, the Houthi movement fired a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv, Israel, hitting the perimeter of Ben Gurion Airport's main terminal. The attack caused air traffic to stop and several major airlines to cancel their flights for a few days. The article also mentions that the attack was the first time a missile landed so close to Israel's main airport.


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/the-airlines-impacted-by-the-global-tech-outage): 
Content: CNN shows an image of a crowded airport. <image:9940>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides conflicting information. The Wikipedia article mentions a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, but the date is May 4, 2025, which contradicts the claim's date of July 19, 2024. The image search results show a crowded airport, but the context is not related to the Houthi attack.

Therefore, the claim is still not fully verifiable. The evidence suggests a Houthi attack on an airport, but the dates and specific events are inconsistent with the claim. More specific evidence is needed to confirm the claim.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also report on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. <image:2533> The Guardian article mentions police urging residents to "respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives".


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. The web search confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the attack caused people to flee the airport. The Reuters article mentions a drone strike, and The Guardian article mentions safety instructions, but neither confirms the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the Houthi attack.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim remains unverified. While the initial evidence confirmed a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, and the image was likely taken in Israel, there's no direct link between the attack and the image. Subsequent searches yielded conflicting dates for airport attacks and images of crowded airports without a clear connection to the specific event. The evidence is insufficient to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)

Several celebrities are using social media to show support for Israel and denounce Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians which left at least 1,000 people dead.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From [Gal Gadot](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/gal-gadot-reacts-to-israeli-palestine-conflict-101696757328407.html)
, Sonam Kapoor, [Gigi Hadid](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/what-is-gigi-hadid-and-bella-hadids-connection-with-palestine-mohamed-anwar-hadid-101697011221005.html)
 to Dwayne Johnson, celebrities are taking to social media to show their support for [Israel](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-position-vis-a-vis-israel-palestine-conflict-101697021932828.html)
 amid the country’s declared war against [Hamas](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-war-live-updates-hamas-jerusalem-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-strip-lebanon-joe-biden-qatar-101696981753474.html)
 following the attack by the Palestinian militants last weekend. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person,” she wrote on Instagram.

Dwayne Johnson
--------------

Actor Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, posted a long note, wherein he ‘condemned and denounced terrorism’. She re-posted a viral infographic via her Instagram Story that stated, “It is absolutely reasonable and logical to be opposed to the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians while simultaneously calling for the protection of Jews in Israel and around the world”.

Liev Schreiber
--------------

In his Instagram stories, the Ray Donovan star, 56, shared a post from the organisation StandWithUs, dedicated to opposing anti-semitism, which included an image of the Israeli flag and read, “Now and always, we stand with the people of Israel!” Below the post, he wrote, “We stand with the people of Israel and the IDF in their fight against Hamas and other terrorist groups. The sanctity of our common humanity will hopefully serve to heal the unimaginable wounds of division.
