## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to a Spotlight by EBU article published on March 13, 2025, the video and images were falsely shared online with captions claiming Zelenskyy signed bombs to be dropped on Gazans. The video was actually taken at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, and the handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. The Euronews article from March 7, 2025, reports that Zelenskyy called for an air and sea truce after a Russian missile attack. The CNN article from March 19, 2025, discusses the exchange of attacks between Ukraine and Russia. ![image 40](media/66.jpg)

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of Zelenskyy signing a bomb (![image 7264](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502412-972178.jpg)). The BBC News website shows an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing what appear to be artillery shells (![image 7265](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502413-075257.jpg)). The Penn Capital-Star published an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (![image 7267](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502413-342824.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells, not bombs. The event took place in a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, not in March 2025. The claim that the shells were intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is also false.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells, not bombs. The event occurred in September 2024, not March 2025, and the shells were not intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, not bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza in March 2025.
