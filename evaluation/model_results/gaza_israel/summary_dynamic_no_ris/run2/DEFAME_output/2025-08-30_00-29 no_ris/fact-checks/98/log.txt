The claim '<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.' is true.
Justification: The claim is likely true. While the exact image of Dwayne Johnson holding the Israeli flag is not explicitly confirmed as authentic, the evidence from multiple sources, including articles from Yahoo News and The Hindustan Times, confirms that he has expressed support for Israel and has been associated with the Israeli flag.

So, the overall veracity is: true
