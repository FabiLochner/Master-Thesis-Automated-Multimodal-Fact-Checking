The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in the Golan Heights, Israel, resulted in the deaths of children, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the image depicts the youngest victim. The image search results do not provide any information about the child's identity or the circumstances of the image. The attack is documented by sources such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054339/rocket-attack-on-israeli-controlled-golan-heights-kills-10-rescue-official-says), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights).

So, the overall veracity is: false
