## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss images of emaciated children in Gaza. One article from ABC News, published on July 31, 2025, focuses on an image of an emaciated Gazan boy, Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq, held by his mother, and mentions his health deteriorated due to a shortage of food and medicine.

Middle East Eye published an article on August 1, 2025, about parents struggling with child starvation in Gaza, including the case of Mohammed al-Mutawaq.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The image of a woman holding a skeleton, which is claimed to be from Gaza, is AI-generated or digitally generated, according to multiple sources. One source provides an analysis of the image, highlighting its artificial nature. Another source mentions an article in the Daily Mail with a different image from Gaza.

The sources include: [https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/), [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14969115/Gaza-skeleton-Palestinian-girl-skin-bone-food-crisis-Israel-hostage-video.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14969115/Gaza-skeleton-Palestinian-girl-skin-bone-food-crisis-Israel-hostage-video.html), and [https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363). ![image 9122](media/2025-08-30_00-30-1756513852-455796.jpg) ![image 9123](media/2025-08-30_00-30-1756513852-592346.jpg) ![image 9124](media/2025-08-30_00-30-1756513852-719272.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image of the woman holding a skeleton is AI-generated or digitally created. Multiple sources confirm the image's artificial nature.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image is AI-generated and not an authentic photograph. Therefore, the claim that it is an authentic image is false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is not authentic. Multiple sources, including [kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/), confirm that the image is AI-generated or digitally created, making the claim false.
