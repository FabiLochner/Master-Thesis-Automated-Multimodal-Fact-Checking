## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. The Jerusalem Post also included a photograph of the airbase. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim. More information is needed to verify if the image depicts the actual attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats Project published a map showing the attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon on September 22, 2024, including a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa. ![image 9835](media/2025-08-30_01-14-1756516443-353629.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides a map of the attacks on September 22, 2024, which includes a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa. However, the evidence still does not confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/middleeast/israel-strikes-hezbollah-weakened-analysis-intl): 
Content: CNN published an image of a damaged building and cars after the attacks. ![image 9849](media/2025-08-30_01-14-1756516457-671868.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the image in the claim is not confirmed by the evidence. The CNN image shows damage from the attacks, but it is not of the airbase. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim is about an image of the Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase allegedly attacked by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024. While multiple sources confirm that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the airbase on that date, and some sources provide images and drone footage of the airbase, none of the evidence confirms that the image in the claim is authentic. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase after an attack on September 22, 2024, cannot be verified. While multiple sources, including Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)) and Politico.eu ([Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)), confirm that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the airbase on that date, and other sources provide images and drone footage of the airbase, none of the evidence confirms the authenticity of the image presented in the claim.
