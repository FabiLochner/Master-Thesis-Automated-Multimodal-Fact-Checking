### Evidence from `image_search`
On October 26, 2024, Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/26/condemnation-calls-for-restraint-world-reacts-to-israeli-strikes-on-iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/26/condemnation-calls-for-restraint-world-reacts-to-israeli-strikes-on-iran)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk)) reported on Israeli strikes on military targets in Iran. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats reported that the IDF launched three waves of strikes targeting around 20 locations around Tehran and western Iran on October 25 ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-28-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-28-2024)).

The strikes occurred in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan, and Tehran. ![image 9220](media/2025-08-30_00-33-1756513983-858839.jpg), ![image 9221](media/2025-08-30_00-33-1756513985-749940.jpg), and ![image 9222](media/2025-08-30_00-33-1756513985-871522.jpg)


## Elaboration

The image search results include maps and reports from Al Jazeera and CNN, confirming the attacks. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Israel or Palestine.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, as the claim states. The image search results include maps and reports from Al Jazeera and CNN, confirming the attacks. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Israel or Palestine.
