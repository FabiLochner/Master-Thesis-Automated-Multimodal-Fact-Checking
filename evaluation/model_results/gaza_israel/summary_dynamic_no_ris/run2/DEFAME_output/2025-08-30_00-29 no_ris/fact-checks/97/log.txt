Useful result: From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php): 
Content: The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The US's stance on the resolution is mentioned, including its requests and potential veto. The report does not mention the US reinstituting the draft.

Useful result: From [Source](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15907.doc.htm): 
Content: The United Nations published a press release on November 20, 2024, regarding a Security Council meeting. The Security Council failed to adopt a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also called for the release of hostages and humanitarian aid. The United States stated that the resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas.

The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The search results, including articles from the UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216)), Security Council Report, and a UN press release, focus on the US's actions regarding a UN resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, specifically a veto. However, none of the provided sources mention the US reinstituting the draft.

So, the overall veracity is: false
