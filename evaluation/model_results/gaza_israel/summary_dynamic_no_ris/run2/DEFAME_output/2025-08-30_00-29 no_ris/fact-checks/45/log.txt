The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: While Greta Thunberg did declare "f–k Israel" at a rally, as reported by the New York Post ([Source](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html)), there is no evidence to support the claim that she held a sign with the phrase "Fuck Israel."

So, the overall veracity is: false
