### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, which killed one man and wounded four others. ![image 2525](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009980-789318.jpg)

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also report on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. ![image 2533](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009985-059149.jpg) The Guardian article mentions police urging residents to "respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives".


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. The web search confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the attack caused people to flee the airport. The Reuters article mentions a drone strike, and The Guardian article mentions safety instructions, but neither confirms the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the Houthi attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport" states that on May 4, 2025, the Houthi movement fired a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv, Israel, hitting the perimeter of Ben Gurion Airport's main terminal. The attack caused air traffic to stop and several major airlines to cancel their flights for a few days. The article also mentions that the attack was the first time a missile landed so close to Israel's main airport.


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/the-airlines-impacted-by-the-global-tech-outage): 
Content: CNN shows an image of a crowded airport. ![image 9940](media/2025-08-30_01-18-1756516718-521024.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides conflicting information. The Wikipedia article mentions a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, but the date is May 4, 2025, which contradicts the claim's date of July 19, 2024. The image search results show a crowded airport, but the context is not related to the Houthi attack.

Therefore, the claim is still not fully verifiable. The evidence suggests a Houthi attack on an airport, but the dates and specific events are inconsistent with the claim. More specific evidence is needed to confirm the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israel airport July 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim remains unverified. While the initial evidence confirmed a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, and the image was likely taken in Israel, there's no direct link between the attack and the image. Subsequent searches yielded conflicting dates for airport attacks and images of crowded airports without a clear connection to the specific event. The evidence is insufficient to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely taken in Israel, and there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts people fleeing the airport due to the attack. The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While the image was likely taken in Israel, and a Houthi attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts people fleeing the airport due to the attack. The initial evidence confirmed the attack ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), but subsequent searches did not provide a direct link between the attack and the image.
