JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")
", while the names of the victims were projected onto banners. The memorial is dedicated to the five individuals at the Pentagon whose remains were never found, and the partial remains of another 25 victims are buried beneath the memorial.[\[95\]](#cite_note-Cass-95)
 The names of the 184 victims of the Pentagon attack are inscribed on the memorial's side.

On September 11, 2002, the documentary play _[Bystander 9/11](/wiki/Bystander_9/11 "Bystander 9/11")

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

You just retrieved web sources, each one summarized under "Web Sources". **Your task right now is to summarize the web source summaries.**

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
image_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources indicate that there are multiple 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States. These memorials are located in countries such as Australia, Canada, China, France, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom, among others. One source specifically mentions that Israel has 12 memorials. <image:9881>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence shows that the memorial in the image is located in Israel. However, there are multiple 9/11 memorials outside the US, not just the one in Israel.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Hisham al-Sayed's mother holds up a photograph of her son in April 2016

**Palestinian militant group Hamas has released a video appearing to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip.**

The clip appears to show Hisham al-Sayed lying in a bed looking dazed and wearing an oxygen mask - the first sighting of him since 2015.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said releasing a video of a sick man was "reprehensible and desperate."

The BBC has not been able to independently verify the footage.

Hamas alleges that Mr al-Sayed is an Israeli soldier, but both the Israeli government and his family say he is a civilian with mental health problems.

The charity Human Rights Watch, which has criticised Mr al-Sayed's "unlawful detention" in the past, says he was last seen walking into the Gaza Strip in April 2015 for unknown reasons, having made similar attempts to cross the frontier in the past.

In the video released by Hamas the 34-year-old, who is a member of Israel's Bedouin Arab minority, could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.

A television monitor also in the room showed news footage from an economic conference in Qatar earlier this month.

No further details were given by the Palestinian militant group about the detainee's condition other than a reference on Monday to his health having deteriorated.

Israel says he is one of two citizens, the second being Avera Mengistu, currently being held captive by Hamas in violation of international law.

Both are believed to have crossed willingly into the Gaza Strip despite Israel banning its citizens from entering the Palestinian enclave.

There was some suggestion that the video's release was an attempt by Hamas to pressure Israel into resuming prisoner swap negotiations.

The two sides have engaged in prisoner swaps in the past, most notably in 2011 when abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

Published date: 24 April 2025 11:37 BST | Last update: 4 months ago

It is 18 months since [Israel](https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel)
 declared [war on Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-gaza)
, following the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023, which killed more than 1,100 people.

At the time of writing, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 injured from a pre-war population of 2.2 million. And on 13 April, Israel bombed [al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-bombs-one-last-functioning-hospitals-gaza)
, Gaza’s last fully functioning hospital.

More than 90 percent of health facilities in Gaza sustained some damage throughout 2024.

Witnesses to the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital said the Israeli military gave staff and patients, some of who were in intensive care, 18 minutes to leave.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)A doctor from the Red Crescent told MEE that medical staff now had to send displaced patients to other hospitals which themselves had limited care.

"All the hospitals are overcrowded and are unprepared for providing full medical services,” he said. Israel has also blockaded supplies of aid and other essentials into [Gaza since 2 March](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-blocks-all-aid-entering-gaza-following-end-first-phase-ceasefire)
.

The Palestinian dead have come from all age groups: women, children and the elderly account for 56 percent of those killed.

That high level of fatalities has also slashed the average life expectancy of Palestinians, according to a [study in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02810-1/abstract)
.

For Palestinian men, the drop in average life expectancy has been 51.6 percent to 40.5 years during the first 12 months of the war - that’s a loss of 34.9 years of life. 

For Palestinian women, it has been a cut of 38.6 percent to an average life expectancy of 47.5 years - a loss of 29.9 years. Before the war, agriculture, according to the [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/FAO-gaza-emergency-relief-food-production/en)
, accounted for “approximately 10 percent of Gaza’s economy, with more than 560,000 people relying entirely or partially on cropping, herding, or fishing for their livelihoods”.

More importantly, agriculture allowed Palestinians to feed themselves. 

That stopped with the war, as [fishing fleets](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:aff5befe-3f73-48d4-af91-201f2fcc4bf1)

![Food production losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza%20food%20production%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=-Hxm_-tM)

The scarcity of food has been reflected in high prices: for example, in [Deir al-Balah Governorate](https://www.solidarites.org/en/?s=gaza)
 in central Gaza, food prices soared between October 2023 and December 2024, including a kilogram of flour (1,058 by percent), tomatoes (956 percent), cucumbers (752 percent), lentils (360 percent) and rice (142 percent) among others.

In April 2025, Gaza’s [bakery owners’ association](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-bakeries-forced-close-gaza-due-lack-flour-and-fuel)
, announced that they had all shut due to a lack of flour and fuel because of Israel’s blockade.

Likewise, livestock has been hit: [milk production](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2024/02/01/gaza-fresh-milk-supply/)
, for example, has almost halted on occasion, while meat is hard to come by.

![Livestock losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza-livestock-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=4F0cszaN)

Farmer Faraj Jarudat, a farmer from northern Gaza, [told The Guardian in November 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/gaza-food-production-decimated-70-per-cent-farmland-hit)
 that he used to own three cows and 60 sheep. “There is not a single one left.”

The farm and his home, he was told by friends and former neighbours, had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.

### Malnutrition in Gaza

The lack of food that has been a constant during Israel’s war on Gaza has brought with it malnutrition.

In April 2024, Oxfam reported that Palestinians in northern Gaza were surviving on an average of 245 calories per day, or [less than one can of fava beans](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-northern-gaza-living-less-can-beans-day-report-says)
. My face is pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

The Palestinian population has often been driven to extreme measures, such as [eating grass](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-are-being-forced-eat-grass-heres-what-it-does-your-body)
, which is indigestible for humans, causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and has negligible nutritional value. On other occasions, [animal fodder](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-forced-mix-animal-fodder-flour-make-bread)
 has been used to make bread.

Many NGOs, charities, and other agencies use the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)
 to analyse food security and nutrition. The scale runs from 1 (none/minimal) to 5 (catastrophe/famine).

![Malnutrition in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-malnutrition-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=Q_cCAFdK)

In February 2025, it was estimated that at least 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for [acute malnutrition](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-4-february-2025-1500)
 in the coming year.

There have already been instances of child fatalities, including [Azzam al-Shaer](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-on-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-malnutrition-gaza-hunger-crisis-rages)
, who died in June 2024; and [Yazan al-Kafarna](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-hunger-and-malnutrition-gaza)
, who died in March 2024.

Yazan was born with cerebral palsy, meaning he had to follow a special diet and take supplements. Human waste is one of the many forms of pollution in Gaza, attracting mosquitoes that in turn can spread disease.

![Sanitation in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-sanitation%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=lM4cHkaX)

Homeless Palestinians, who usually live in tents, have little protection against insect bites and their serious effects.

In May 2024, [Omar Nasser described to MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)
 how his daughter Gada, then aged nine, had contracted hepatitis A, a liver infection that is transmitted through solid human waste and can be caught from coming into contact with unclean water or eating food handled by an infected person.

Nasser took his daughter to hospital, where a doctor prescribed some medications and a nutritional diet, which Nasser could not provide as he is unemployed.

"The doctor said she must not eat canned food, but it's the only food we get from the aid organisations," he said. “I’ve had to ask people for food to provide for my daughter.”

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)

The dog attack, which lasted about 10 minutes, left Arian in unbearable pain and caused complications that would last for months, ultimately leading to the loss of her newborn. "It's the army," he said.

### ‘It wasn’t a regular dog’

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)) reported an incident from December 28, 2011, where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a woman. <image:2790>

Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) published an article on January 6, 2025, about an Israeli army dog attack on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023, which resulted in the loss of her newborn. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image from China Daily of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>) and a video from Al Jazeera about an Israeli military dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>).

The China Daily image can be found here: [Source](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm). The Al Jazeera video can be found here: [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
image_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)) reported an incident from December 28, 2011, where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a woman. <image:2790>

Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) published an article on January 6, 2025, about an Israeli army dog attack on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023, which resulted in the loss of her newborn. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image from China Daily of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>) and a video from Al Jazeera about an Israeli military dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>).

The China Daily image can be found here: [Source](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm). The Al Jazeera video can be found here: [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:65>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.14, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.1, 'Romania': 0.1, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Mongolia': 0.06, 'Peru': 0.06, 'India': 0.04, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Palestine': 0.04, 'Tunisia': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was not taken in Israel or Palestine, which contradicts the claim. The image's origin is more likely in countries like Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, or Romania.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there have been documented instances of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, the specific image in the claim has not been verified. The geolocation analysis suggests the image was not taken in Israel or Palestine. Therefore, the claim is likely false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is likely false. While there is evidence of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, the specific image in the claim has not been verified. Furthermore, geolocation analysis suggests the image was not taken in Israel or Palestine.
