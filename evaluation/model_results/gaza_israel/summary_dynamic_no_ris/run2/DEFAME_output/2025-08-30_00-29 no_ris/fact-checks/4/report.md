The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is likely taken in Palestine or Israel. The evidence suggests that the image was taken by Anadolu and may depict the use of white phosphorus by Israel in Gaza. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen. The date in the claim (December 22, 2024) is also not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely from Palestine or Israel and is related to the conflict there. The claim that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.
