The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Quds News Network ([Source](https://t.me/s/QudsNen?before=158681)) indicates that Sham Imad Muhareb died from injuries sustained in an Israeli bombing and lost her right hand, directly contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
