### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, codenamed Operation True Promise II, in retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and other leaders. Israel shot down most of the incoming missiles. The attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations of IRGC, Hamas, and Hezbollah leaders. The article also mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was not killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) reported that he visited the Nevatim air force base after the attack. Furthermore, NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) reported that he was fired on November 5, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Yoav Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Gallant was alive after the attack and was later fired from his position.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
