## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024, and arranging flights. The U.S. government has also been providing charter flights for U.S. citizens and lawful residents to leave Israel since October 13, 2023. The evidence indicates that those using the flights from Israel will be asked to repay the U.S. government.

The claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the flights from Israel are for U.S. citizens and lawful residents, and they are expected to repay the U.S. government.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is providing assistance to U.S. citizens in both Lebanon and Israel, including loans and chartered flights. The evidence indicates that those using the flights from Israel will be asked to repay the U.S. government. The claim that the U.S. is flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is providing emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon amid escalating conflict, as well as charter flights for U.S. citizens and lawful residents to leave Israel since October 2023, with repayment expected for the latter, according to sources like [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/). The claim that the U.S. is flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not supported by the evidence.
