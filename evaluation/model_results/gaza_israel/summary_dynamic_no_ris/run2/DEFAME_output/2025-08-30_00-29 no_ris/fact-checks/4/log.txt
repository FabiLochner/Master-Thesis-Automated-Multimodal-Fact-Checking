The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim, sourced from Anadolu, likely depicts a bombing in Palestine or Israel, possibly related to the use of white phosphorus by Israel, as indicated by the search results. The claim that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
