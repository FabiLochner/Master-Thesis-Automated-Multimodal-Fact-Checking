CNN published an article on July 11, 2025, discussing the ICE detention of Mahmoud Khalil, mentioning his arrest in March, his detention in various facilities, and his claims against the Trump administration.

The ACLU also published press releases about the case in May and July 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions an online campaign against Khalil before his arrest and demonstrations protesting his detention in New York City. The CNN article includes Khalil's statements about the conditions of his detention and the reasons for his arrest.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo): 
Content: The BBC published an article on June 20, 2025, about Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, facing deportation from the U.S. ![image 9553](media/2025-08-30_00-57-1756515436-405291.jpg), ![image 9557](media/2025-08-30_00-57-1756515437-312100.jpg), ![image 9555](media/2025-08-30_00-57-1756515436-551745.jpg). Khalil's arrest by immigration agents was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators. Khalil was arrested and detained for three months before a judge ruled he must be released. The article mentions Khalil's role in protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, was arrested by ICE in March 2025. The Wikipedia article states he was arrested on March 8, 2025, and the ACLU and CNN also report his arrest in March 2025. The BBC article mentions that Khalil was facing deportation. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Khalil was a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.

The evidence suggests that Khalil's arrest was related to his activism and protests. The ACLU and Khalil's legal team claim the arrest was in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. The BBC article links the arrest to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators.

To fully verify the claim, information about Khalil's immigration status at the time of his arrest is missing.
