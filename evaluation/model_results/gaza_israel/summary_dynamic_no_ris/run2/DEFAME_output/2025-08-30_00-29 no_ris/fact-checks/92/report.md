### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza resulted in casualties, including children, in July and August 2024. The Human Rights Watch report indicates a high number of child fatalities by mid-September 2024. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the evidence, the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child under rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike is plausible. However, the exact date and location within Gaza cannot be confirmed.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the specific date and location of the event depicted in the image.


## Final Judgement
The evidence supports the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike, as confirmed by multiple sources reporting on Israeli attacks in Gaza during the specified timeframe. The geolocation data also supports this. However, the exact date and location of the event in the image cannot be confirmed. `true`

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification

The geolocation data also supports this. However, the exact date and location of the event in the image cannot be confirmed.
