## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, discussing the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, including a video of Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 9882](media/2025-08-30_01-15-1756516550-465033.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article on September 6, 2024, discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024, and includes the image of Netanyahu's office (![image 56](media/87.jpg)).

The Times of Israel published an article discussing the disarmament of Hezbollah and the Israeli military presence in Lebanon, mentioning a ceasefire deal signed in November 2024, and includes images of Hezbollah supporters (![image 9886](media/2025-08-30_01-15-1756516558-658395.jpg)) and US envoy Tom Barrack (![image 9885](media/2025-08-30_01-15-1756516558-026984.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office (![image 56](media/87.jpg)) was published by Al Jazeera in an article discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024. The evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image does show Netanyahu's office and was published in August 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Additional information is needed to verify whether Hezbollah captured and published the image.

## Elaboration

Therefore, the claim is partially supported.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024, but the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

`false`
