Twenty-six-year-old rescued from hotel in Naypyidaw as agencies call for increased aid before monsoon

A man has been pulled alive from the rubble of a hotel in [Myanmar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar)
, five days after the country’s worst earthquake in a century flattened entire neighbourhoods and tore through temples, bridges and highways.

A joint team of rescuers from [Myanmar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar)
 and Turkey found the 26-year-old in the ruins of the building in the capital, Naypyidaw, after midnight, the fire service and the country’s ruling junta said.

The disaster has killed more than 2,700 people, and the death toll is expected to surpass 3,000 on Wednesday, according to Myanmar’s military ruler, Min Aung Hlaing. Humanitarian agencies urged other countries to increase aid before the monsoon rains.

Close to the epicentre, in the [devastated cities of Mandalay](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/a-hospital-collapsed-right-in-front-of-me-myanmar-reels-after-earthquake)
 and Sagaing, traumatised survivors slept in the street, with the stench of corpses trapped under the rubble permeating the disaster zone. Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPA

“The devastating impact of Friday’s earthquake is becoming clearer by the hour – this is a crisis on top of a crisis for Myanmar, where the humanitarian situation is already dire,” said Arif Noor, the Myanmar country director for the humanitarian agency Care.

“[Rescue teams are still recovering](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/29/myanmar-volunteers-dig-earthquake-victims)
 those trapped under the rubble, and hospitals are overwhelmed. “You cannot ask for aid with one hand and bomb with the other,” said Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.

The junta has declared a week of national mourning, with flags to fly at half mast on official buildings until 6 April “in sympathy for the loss of life and damages”.

The junta said on Wednesday that it was declaring a temporary ceasefire until 22 April to facilitate relief efforts, a day after armed resistance groups opposed to military rule declared unilateral temporary ceasefires.

In its nightly news bulletin on Tuesday, the state-controlled MRTV quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying the military had halted its offensives but that unspecified minority ethnic armies were planning to exploit the disaster."

Rescue crews in Myanmar pulled a 26-year-old man out alive from the rubble of the capital city hotel where he worked early on Wednesday (April 2, 2025), but most teams were finding only bodies five days after a massive earthquake hit the country.

After using an endoscopic camera to pinpoint Naing Lin Tun's location in the rubble and confirm that he was alive, the man was gingerly pulled through a hole jackhammered through a floor and loaded on to a gurney nearly 108 hours after he was trapped in the hotel where he worked.

! One body was removed from the rubble early Wednesday (April 2, 2025), raising the death total in Bangkok to 22 with 34 injured, primarily at the construction site.

Myanmar has been wracked by civil war and the earthquake is making a dire humanitarian crisis even worse, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations.

#### Claims of an attack on a Chinese Red Cross convoy

The Three Brotherhood Alliance, one of a powerful group of militias that has taken a large swath of the country from the military, announced a unilateral one-month ceasefire on Tuesday (April 1, 2025) to facilitate the humanitarian response. State-run MRTV reported that the rescue in the city of Naypyitaw was carried out by a Turkish and local team and took more than nine hours.

[The 7.7 magnitude earthquake](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/myanmars-earthquake-death-toll-jumps-as-more-bodies-recovered-from-the-rubble/article69389350.ece)
 hit midday Friday (March 28, 2025), toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop near Ohn Ma Tee village, the site of recent fighting with the TNLA.

Asked about he incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun did not comment on the attack, but said “relief supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China to Myanmar have arrived in Myanmar and are on the way to Mandalay,” adding that “rescue personnel and supplies are safe.”

China is incredibly economically important to Myanmar, and also one of the military's largest suppliers with weapons, along with Russia.

On Tuesday (April 1, 2025), Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the UN-backed Human Rights Council, said on X that military attacks must stop to facilitate aid.

“The focus in Myanmar must be on saving lives, not taking them,” he said.

! <image:9948>

#### Extent of devastation beyond major cities is still unclear

Most of the details so far have come from Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, which was near the epicentre of the earthquake, and the capital Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometres north of Mandalay.

Many areas are without power, telephone or cell connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in.

In Singu township, about 65 kilometres north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported.

In the area of Inle Lake, northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the government's official Global New Light of Myanmar reported without providing specific figures.

! So far, 2,886 people have been reported dead in Myanmar and another 4,639 injured, according to state television MRTV, but local reports suggest much higher figures.

The earthquake also rocked neighbouring Thailand, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok. The shadow opposition National Unity Government had already called a ceasefire for its forces.

! Most recently, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday (April 1, 2025) on a road in the northern part of Shan state near Ohn Ma Tee village.

The Ta'ang National Liberation Army said the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military.

But Major General Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military regime, told state-run MRTV that the convoy had not notified authorities of its route ahead of time. <image:9948>

#### More international aid heads to Myanmar

Countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organisations with the monumental task ahead.

Australia on Wednesday (April 2, 2025) said it was providing another $4.5 million, in addition to $1.25 million it had already committed, and had a rapid response team on the ground.

India has flown in aid and sent two Navy ships with supplies as well as providing some 200 rescue workers. Agency for International Development arrived Tuesday (April 1, 2025) to determine how best to respond given limited US resources due to the slashing of the foreign aid budget and dismantling of the agency as an independent operation."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in Turkey. The search results show that the image could be related to an earthquake. The Guardian and The Hindu published articles about an earthquake in Myanmar in April 2025. The articles do not mention the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is also contradicted by the evidence, as the image is likely from Turkey, not Gaza. The evidence does not mention any Israeli bombing in July 2024.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on April 2, 2025, about an earthquake in Myanmar, mentioning a 26-year-old man pulled alive from the rubble of a hotel in Naypyidaw <image:9915>. The article also includes images of rescuers in orange jackets <image:9935> and states that the earthquake has killed more than 2,700 people. The Hindu also published an article on April 2, 2025, about a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, including a photograph of an earthquake survivor being treated by medical personnel <image:9948>. The article mentions a man rescued from the rubble five days after the earthquake and the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok.

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in Turkey. The search results show that the image could be related to an earthquake. The Guardian and The Hindu published articles about an earthquake in Myanmar in April 2025. The articles do not mention the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is also contradicted by the evidence, as the image is likely from Turkey, not Gaza. The evidence does not mention any Israeli bombing in July 2024.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is likely from Turkey, and the claim misrepresents the context. The image is not related to Gaza or an Israeli bombing. `false`
