### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporte, invited representatives from the Israeli Embassy in Spain to a soccer match and was presented with an Israeli flag ![image 6691](media/2025-08-29_20-03-1756497831-342851.jpg) after Barcelona ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv. This event was reported by i24NEWS ([https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel)) on February 16, 2023.

The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/)) also reported on the event, noting that the Spanish government criticized Barcelona's mayor for cutting ties with Israel. The article includes a photo of Spain's Foreign Minister ![image 6692](media/2025-08-29_20-03-1756497836-119702.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with Israeli diplomats holding an Israeli flag. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, as reported by multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post and i24NEWS. The claim that the image was taken in September 2024 is therefore incorrect. The evidence also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, but it does not specify the exact dates of the conflict.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts FC Barcelona's president with Israeli diplomats holding an Israeli flag. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, not in September 2024 as the claim states.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows FC Barcelona's president with Israeli diplomats holding an Israeli flag, which occurred on February 16, 2023, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893) and i24NEWS, contradicting the claim that it was taken in September 2024.
