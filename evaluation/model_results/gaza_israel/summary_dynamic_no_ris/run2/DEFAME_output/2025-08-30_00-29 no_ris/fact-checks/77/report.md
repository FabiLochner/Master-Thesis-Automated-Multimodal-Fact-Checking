## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources discuss an earthquake in Israel on October 5, 2024. An article from NDTV, published on October 7, 2024, mentions earthquakes in both Iran and Israel on that date, sparking speculation about nuclear tests. The Johns Hopkins University published an article on February 4, 2025, debunking claims that linked the Iranian earthquake to a seismic event in Israel on the same evening. An article from alphadefense.in, also published on October 7, 2024, discusses a seismic event in Iran on October 5, 2024, which led to speculation about a nuclear test.
