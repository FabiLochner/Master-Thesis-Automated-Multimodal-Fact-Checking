Content: CNN published an image of a damaged building and cars after the attacks. <image:9849>

The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase after an attack on September 22, 2024, cannot be verified. While multiple sources, including Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)) and Politico.eu ([Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)), confirm that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the airbase on that date, and other sources provide images and drone footage of the airbase, none of the evidence confirms the authenticity of the image presented in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
