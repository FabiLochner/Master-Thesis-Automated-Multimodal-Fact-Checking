The comments came during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago where Trump aired a long list of complaints about a wide range of issues, ranging from President Biden's new ban on offshore drilling, to his various legal cases, to the Panama Canal.

Negotiations between Hamas and Israel are ongoing in Qatar, with Hamas this week [naming 34 hostages](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/g-s1-41220/israel-hamas-hostage-negotiations)
 in Gaza — including two dual U.S. citizens — it would be willing to release in a ceasefire deal.

Steve Witcoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, joined Trump briefly and told reporters that "we're making a lot of progress" in trying to free hostages held by Hamas, and that he was "really hopeful that by the inaugural we'll have some good things to announce."

Trump would not elaborate on what he meant by his threat — first announced [on social media in early December](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113584730902816413)
 — that "all hell will break out" if a deal is not made.

"It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone," Trump said.

![U.S. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is,” Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Tuesday, adding that “there should have never been” the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel.

Steve Witkoff, Trump’s pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, struck an optimistic note about the state of negotiations to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would secure the release of the hostages, saying negotiators are “making a lot of progress.”

“It’s the president, his reputation, the things that he has said that are driving this negotiation, and so hopefully it’ll all work out and we’ll save some lives,” Witkoff added. January 7, 2025.

U.S. January 7, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. CNN has previously reported that Biden administration officials are taking the lead in the talks, while their incoming Trump counterparts are being closely updated on developments.

But a senior Biden administration official struck a much more cautious tone following Trump and Witkoff’s comments, telling CNN that the negotiations remain “difficult.”

The official – who declined to comment further on the status of the talks – insisted that despite Witkoff appearing to suggest that a deal before January 20 was realistic, the talks are challenging. The first ceasefire – weeks after the October 7 attack – saw the release of dozens of hostages, but subsequent efforts to pause the fighting and secure the release of additional hostages have gone nowhere.

Witkoff told reporters he expected to travel back to Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday."

Content: "The assault was launched after Hamas fighters stormed Israeli territory in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israeli military strikes killed at least 24 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said, as the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory urged international donors to immediately provide fuel to run generators and maintain medical services.

One of those strikes killed four people in a house in Gaza City and six were killed in separate strikes across the enclave, medics said.

Later on Tuesday, an Israeli strike on a tent in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip killed four children and eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia in the north, medics said.

Additionally, an Israeli strike on a car in Khan Younis killed two people, medics and civil emergency service officials said.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those strikes.

It said [240 Palestinians](/world/middle-east/israel-detains-medics-after-hospital-raid-health-officials-say-2024-12-28/)
 its forces had detained in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza last month had provided "substantial intelligence".

The military released footage of the interrogation of a purported Hamas militant who detailed how militants "operated from the hospital area" and transferred weapons to and from it.

Hamas and the Gaza health ministry deny any armed presence at the hospital.

JERUSALEM/CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Hamas stood by its demand on Tuesday that Israel fully end its assault on Gaza under any deal to release hostages, and said U.S. 20 inauguration.

Officials from the Islamist group and Israel have been holding talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in the most intensive effort for months to reach a ceasefire [in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)

 as an unofficial deadline.

But with the clock ticking, both sides accuse the other of blocking a deal by adhering to conditions that torpedoed all previous peace efforts for more than a year.

Hamas says it will free its remaining hostages only if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw all its troops from Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office did not comment.

In one notable step towards a deal, a Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday the group had [cleared a list](/world/middle-east/blinken-calls-push-get-gaza-truce-deal-over-finish-line-2025-01-06/)
 submitted by Israel of 34 hostages who could be freed in the initial phase of a truce, alongside Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

The list included female Israeli soldiers, plus elderly, female and minor-aged civilians. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

**\[1/3\]**A woman walks past posters of hostages kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, December 16, 2024. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled and all hostages are free.

"Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of the hostages," the director general of Israel's foreign ministry, Eden Bar Tal, told a briefing with reporters, saying Israel was fully committed to reaching a deal.

Hamas official Osama Hamdan, who held a news conference in Algiers, said Israel was to blame for undermining all efforts to reach a deal.

While he said he would not give details about the latest round of negotiations, he reiterated the Hamas conditions of "a complete end to the aggression and a full withdrawal from lands the occupation invaded".

Commenting on Trump's threat that there would be "hell to pay" unless all hostages were freed before the inauguration, Hamdan said: "I think the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump was rash to say there would be "hell to pay" unless they go free by his Jan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had so far received no confirmation about whether those on its list were still alive.

ISRAEL KEEPS UP AIRSTRIKES

Nearly 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza, according to health officials in the enclave."

Content: "Except courage, courage is made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — André Fran (@andrefran) [October 22, 2023](https://twitter.com/andrefran/status/1716203264440467498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While it's entirely possible that Bourdain might have agreed with the words in the quote, we have so far been unable to find any credible record of him ever having made this exact statement.

Bourdain [died by suicide](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-asia-argento-last-texts-down-and-out-in-paradise-excerpt/)
 in June 2018 in France, reportedly [hanging himself](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-death-no-evidence-foul-play-violence-report/)
 in his hotel room. We'll also take a look back at the fact that Bourdain had visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for an episode of his CNN show, which resulted in several noteworthy comments and tweets he made in regard to Palestinians.

A Quote Misattributed
---------------------

The oldest version of the quote that we could find with Bourdain's name attached to it was from July 2021.

> “Today nearly everything is made in China-except for courage, it’s made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — Rama Al Malah (@MalahRama) [July 25, 2021](https://twitter.com/MalahRama/status/1419149132053221381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Meanwhile, we found similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, showing that his name had been misattributed with the quote.

> "Today nearly everything is made in China...except for courage- it's made in Palestine." [pic.twitter.com/zdnMsjEH4g](https://t.co/zdnMsjEH4g)
>

> Today almost everything is made in China!... [#psychicpowers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/psychicpowers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The episode included several key moments of narration from Bourdain that helped to shed light on what his thoughts _might_ be if he were still alive and asked about the "courage is made in Palestine" quote.

During the episode, upon entering a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza, Bourdain referred to the territory as being "a prison":

 Clifford May, the founder and president of FDD.

Khalidi told the [_New York Post_](https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/)
, “I do not speak to the _Post_ (or the _Times_ for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late.” (The _Post_ noted it “did not offer or agree to any terms conditioning that response as off the record or on background.”

Dumisani Washington, founder and CEO of the Institute for Black Solidarity with Israel, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DumisaniTemsgen/status/1862727604458938552)
 that Biden appearing with the book suggests that the president is not a friend of Jews and Israel.

“Elections matter,” [wrote](https://twitter.com/AdamMossoff/status/1862728873093263589)
 Adam Mossoff, a law professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Never forget the gaslighting by the Biden-Harris administration over the past year, and especially by Kamala Harris who periodically dropped her mask and did reveal her true beliefs.”

**‘The double pander continues’**

In a 2020 review of the work in question in _Jewish Review of Books_, the Israeli historian Benny Morris noted that Khalidi has downplayed his PLO connection in the past.

The book “turns out to be yet another somewhat turgid recitation of the traditional Palestinian narrative, its mantras being Western and Zionist guilt for everything that has befallen the Palestinians and a passionate, personal assertion of Palestinian innocence,” Morris [wrote](https://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/7210/the-war-on-history/#)
. 

“Khalidi’s bottom line is that Zionism is a ‘colonialist’ enterprise, a doctrine enunciated in the Palestine National Charter of 1964,” he added. “It’s absolutely worthless.”

Daniel Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DanielPipes/status/1862849729689702594)
 that Biden said on Nov. 29, “Biden picks up _The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine_” by “former PLO spokesman and anti-Zionist fanatic Rashid Khalidi.”

“The double pander continues right up to Jan."

US President Joe Biden was spotted yesterday leaving a bookstore in Nantucket, Massachusetts holding Arab-American academic Rashid Khalidi’s “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine.”

The book presents itself as “a history of settler colonialism and resistance from 1917 to 2017.”

Khalidi has argued that Palestinians living under Israeli military rule have a legal right to resistance and that supporters of Israel use McCarthyite tactics to silence debate in America.

Asked by the New York Post his thoughts on Biden picking up his book, Khalidi responds that it was “four years too late.”

Many Arab Americans who typically voted for Democratic candidates in presidential elections shifted their support to Donald Trump in this month’s election due to anger over Biden’s support for Israel in the war against Hamas.

Is The Times of Israel important to you?

If so, we have a request. 

Every day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention."

[President Biden](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden)
 on Friday picked up a copy of a book that described Israel as a colonial power in the face of Palestinian resistance despite his repeated support for the Jewish state. 

Biden was spotted by the press leaving Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017" by Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, the New York Post reported. 

"I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late," Khalidi told the Post of Biden holding his book. 

The newspaper noted it did not agree to any terms conditioning [Khalidi's response](https://www.foxnews.com/media)
 as off the record or on background.

In the book, Khalidi wrote about Israel's alleged discriminatory policies against Palestinians.

"Settler-colonial confrontations with indigenous peoples have only ended in one of three ways: with the elimination of full subjugation of the native population, as in North America; with the defeat and expulsion of the colonizer, as in Algeria, which is extremely rare; or with the abandonment of colonial supremacy, in the context of compromise and reconciliation, as in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ireland," he wrote.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Khalidi and the White House.

The [book argues](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/hundred-years-war-on-palestine/)
 that "the modern history of Palestine can best be understood in these terms: as a colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people against their will." 

It was not clear if Biden purchased the book or if it was given to him.

Biden has repeatedly declared his support for Israel but has been criticized by Israeli supporters for putting conditions on U.S. Biden has also reportedly criticized his Israeli counterpart behind closed doors, the Post reported.

JNS.org ([https://www.jns.org/biden-photographed-exiting-nantucket-shop-with-anti-israel-book/](https://www.jns.org/biden-photographed-exiting-nantucket-shop-with-anti-israel-book/)) also reports on the event, noting the book's subject matter. The Times of Israel mentions that Hunter Biden, Melissa Cohen Biden, and Beau Biden were also present.


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/): 
Content: The National Herald published an image of Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks. <image:9547>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image shows Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks. Multiple sources, including The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/biden-spotted-leaving-bookstore-holding-the-hundred-years-war-on-palestine/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/biden-spotted-leaving-bookstore-holding-the-hundred-years-war-on-palestine/)) and Fox News ([https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion)), report on this event. The evidence also indicates that the event occurred in late November 2024, as stated in the claim.

The evidence also confirms that Biden was holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine." The image from The National Herald ([https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/](https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/)) shows Biden exiting the bookstore.

Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by multiple reliable sources. The evidence confirms that the image shows Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks in late November 2024, holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine."

Content: "Climate activist Greta Thunberg was filmed giggling as she declared “f–k Germany” and “f–k Israel” at an anti-Israel rally in Germany Friday, video shows.

The 21-year-old appeared as a speaker at the demonstration in the southwestern German city of Mannheim, which included a discussion focused on “solidarity with Palestine and the climate movement.”

“F–k Germany,” [Thunberg says in the clip](https://x.com/StopAntisemites/status/1865513089656840246)
, before bursting into laughter. “And f–k Israel,” she adds to rapturous applause and whistling from the crowd.

A city spokesperson [told German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-attends-pro-palestine-062727591.html)
 that 700 protesters attended the rally, which they described as peaceful.

Thunberg, however, has faced fierce backlash for the comments since the clip was shared on social media.

Thunberg’s speech at the rally in the main market square of Mannheim sparked backlash from supporters of Israel. ZUMAPRESS.com

Manuel Hagel, a conservative leader in a regional parliament, slammed the inflammatory language, [the Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-832423)
 reported.

“Mannheim does not need a platform for such dehumanizing positions and our country does not need the presence of people like Greta Thunberg,” Hagel seethed, according to the outlet.

Advocacy group StopAntisemitism blasted the young activist as a “Hamas shill” in a post that had been viewed more than 70,000 times on X early Monday afternoon.

“Climate activist turned Hamas shill Greta Thunberg has made her stance crystal clear… someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving climate challenges,” the group wrote.

 [!Thunberg speaking behind podium <image:393> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

The rally was a peaceful gathering of 700 people, according to city officials. The climate activist [was named “Antisemite of the Week” by StopAntisemitism](https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/greta-thunberg-named-antisemite-of-the-week-by-jewish-advocacy-group/)
 following her arrest at a rally in September — and is in the running for the group’s “Antisemite of the Year.”

Thunberg was arrested on Sept. 4 while protesting with the group Students Against the Occupation, which called on Copenhagen University to cease all connections with Israel, including putting an end to several cross-university student programs.

She posted a photo of herself holding a sign reading “Stand with Gaza” just days after Oct. 7, alongside a toy octopus — which some read as an allusion to the Nazis’ antisemitic propaganda visualizing Judaism’s supposed network of control over the world.

 [!Greta Thunberg with group of protesters. Getty Images

Thunberg, who is on the autism spectrum, later removed the photo and [claimed she was “completely unaware”](https://nypost.com/2023/10/20/greta-thunberg-posts-pro-palestinian-pic-with-antisemitic-trope/)
 of the historical use of antisemitic octopus imagery and clarified that she meant for it to represent her emotions.

“The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,” she said. Getty Images

A slew of Jewish state supporters also took to X to ask, “Why has she ever been relevant?” and called the incident “nasty.”

“She’s lost the plot entirely,” one critic declared.

This wouldn’t be the first time Thunberg has come under fire for hateful comments. <image:394> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

Thunberg has faced backlash since October 7, when she began openly supporting the Palestinians."

[Greta Thunberg](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/03/greta-thunberg-ruffian-masquerading-as-latter-day-saint/)
 has been accused of being a “Hamas shill” after footage of the [climate change activist](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/12/queen-greta-has-exposed-the-truth-about-the-green-movement/)
 declaring “f--- Israel” at a rally emerged.

Ms Thunberg, 21, was speaking during a discussion on “solidarity with [Palestine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/04/giant-anti-israel-banner-unfurled-outside-parliament/)
 and the climate movement” at a demonstration in the German city of Mannheim on Friday.

“F--- Germany,” Ms Thunberg said in the clip before laughing. “[And f--- Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/27/greta-thunbergs-climate-movement-demonises-israel/)
,” she added, as the crowd applauded.

The footage has been widely shared online and has led to fierce criticism of Ms Thunberg.

Manuel Hagel, a centre-Right member of the local state parliament, said she was “moving very consciously in close proximity to anti-Semitism”.

“Mannheim does not need a platform for such dehumanising positions and our country does not need the presence of people like Greta Thunberg,” the CDU lawmaker told the Jerusalem Post.

    ![Ms Thunberg attended a discussion on 'solidarity with Palestine and the climate movement' last week](/content/dam/world-news/2024/12/10/TELEMMGLPICT000404379477_17338318308280_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBDvQMhznObBNXD_jLcIFB_yKvq_nGV8CVExf4qSbkzM.jpeg?imwidth=350)

A spokesman for the city said more than 700 people attended the peaceful demonstration.

StopAntisemitism, an American campaign group, wrote in a social media post, viewed over 73,000 times: “Climate activist turned Hamas shill Greta Thunberg has made her stance crystal clear.

“Someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving the climate challenge.”

The group has put Ms Thunberg in the running for its “anti-Semite of the year” award, which is open to public vote.

The [Greta Thunberg Foundation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/greta-thunberg-16-year-old-activist-every-leader-planet-wants/)
 was asked for comment but did not immediately respond.

Germany is one of Israel’s staunchest supporters in Europe, which is a legacy of the Holocaust under the Nazi regime.

The German branch of the Fridays for Future climate movement, which began after the then 15-year-old Ms Thunberg’s school strikes protests, has already distanced itself from the Swedish activist.

It came after Ms Thunberg spoke at a climate protest in Amsterdam in November last year. But that does not justify disinformation.”

Ms Thunberg, who is Swedish, was arrested on Sept 4 while protesting with a group calling on Copenhagen University to cut all ties with Israel.

Days after the October 7 terror attacks, she posted a photo of herself holding a sign reading “Stand with Gaza”.

Ms Thunberg, who is autistic, was pictured with a toy octopus, which some interpreted as a reference to Nazi propaganda accusing Jews of controlling the world.

“The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,” Ms Thunberg said, after insisting she was “completely unaware” of the historical use of octopus imagery in anti-Semitic propaganda. Wearing a Palestinian black and white scarf, she urged “ceasefire now”.

Luisa Neubauer, the head of the German chapter of the Fridays for Future movement, said at the time: “It is obvious that for many global organisations, global realities diverge when it comes to Israel and Palestine."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. However, the evidence does not show Thunberg holding a sign that reads "Fuck Israel." The provided evidence includes images of Thunberg at the rally, but none of them show her holding a sign with the specific phrase.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Geldof performing as a solo artist in 1987

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, _Is That It?_,[\[5\]](#cite_note-GeldofBio-5)
 which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with [Dave Stewart](/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)")
 of [Eurythmics](/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")
) and "The Great Song of Indifference". In 1998, he [erroneously announced](/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries "List of premature obituaries")
 [Ian Dury](/wiki/Ian_Dury "Ian Dury")
's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)
 The event caused music paper _[NME](/wiki/NME "NME")
_ (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash")
) to call Geldof 'the world's worst DJ'.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg/250px-Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg)](/wiki/File:Breiti,_Campino,_Bob_Geldof.jpg)

Geldof performing with [Die Toten Hosen](/wiki/Die_Toten_Hosen "Die Toten Hosen")
 at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [Rostock](/wiki/Rostock,_Germany "Rostock, Germany")
, Germany on 7 June 2007

Along with [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [debt relief](/wiki/Debt_relief "Debt relief")
 for developing countries. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [Band Aid 30](/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)#Band_Aid_30 "Band Aid (band)")
, to record an updated version of the [charity single](/wiki/Charity_record "Charity record")
, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [Ebola virus](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease "Ebola virus disease")
 in West Africa.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

### Live Aid

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Live Aid")\
\]

Main article: [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid")

> "The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how Bob Geldof's leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam")
 money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)
 However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

### Commission for Africa

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Commission for Africa")\
\]

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

### DATA and One Campaign

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: DATA and One Campaign")\
\]

Bob Geldof worked closely with [DATA](/wiki/DATA "DATA")
 (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on '[I Don't Like Mondays](/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays "I Don't Like Mondays")
' for 30 years".[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 [Winston Peters](/wiki/Winston_Peters "Winston Peters")
, the [Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand) "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)")
 responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. He said the EU was "a mess" but warned Britain's young people had their futures "taken from them" as a result of the referendum.[\[104\]](#cite_note-104)

Ahead of the [2024 United Kingdom general election](/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election "2024 United Kingdom general election")
 Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)")
 candidate and [Minister of State for Development and Africa](/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Development_and_Africa "Minister of State for Development and Africa")
 [Andrew Mitchell](/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell "Andrew Mitchell")
.[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)

### Fathers' rights

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fathers' rights")\
\]

From January 2002 until sometime in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to [Father's Rights](/wiki/Father%27s_Rights "Father's Rights")
 campaigners; it was reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.[\[130\]](#cite_note-HandInquestReport-130)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-Hand-131)

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children.[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 He has since become an outspoken advocate of [fathers' rights](/wiki/Fathers%27_rights "Fathers' rights")
.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 After Yates' death from a heroin overdose in 2000,[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
 Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
 and later adopted her in 2007.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)
[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 As of 2019, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose.[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 Geldof stated the family was "beyond pain" after he confirmed the news of her death.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
[\[142\]](#cite_note-142)

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015.[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 They currently reside in [Battersea](/wiki/Battersea "Battersea")
, South London.[\[145\]](#cite_note-145)

Regarding his [Jewish](/wiki/Jew "Jew")
 ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based _[Jewish Telegraph](/wiki/Jewish_Telegraph "Jewish Telegraph")
_, Geldof said "I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won."[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)

According to [The Sunday Times Rich List](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_Rich_List "The Sunday Times Rich List")
, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)

Music legend Mary Coughlan has criticised the reaction of Live Aid founder [Bob Geldof](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bob-geldof)
 on Gaza.

After passengers on a recent Air Canada flight discovered that Israel had been removed from the in-flight interactive map and relabeled as the Palestinian Territories, the Canadian flag carrier says that the change is the result of a “display issue.”

“Air Canada has been made aware of a display issue with the interactive map on the IFE systems of its B737 aircraft,” it says in response to an image posted on X of the altered flight map.

“The issue has affected other carriers using the same system and we are working with the third-party provider on a remedy,” it adds.

Last September, passengers noticed a similar change had been made to the interactive maps aboard a JetBlue flight. The airline similarly said that the map had been provided by a third party company, and decided “after a careful review” to switch to a new map vendor.

![a plane flying over a map](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jetblue-Palestinian-map-9sep24.png)

JetBlue has been forced to make changes to its inflight maps and has dumped its current vendor of the popular passenger amenity after Jewish customers noticed that the State of Israel had been obliterated by a much larger place label describing the entire country as the ‘Palestinian Territories.’

Although JetBlue doesn’t even fly anywhere near Israel, JetBlue’s inflight map still has global coverage, and at least one passenger discovered the apparent snub to Israel.

The mistake then quickly went viral and JetBlue responded by launching a review into its third-party inflight map vendor. Always keeping an ear close to the ground, Matt's industry insights, analysis and news coverage is frequently relied upon by some of the biggest names in journalism.

In the meantime, JetBlue said it would find a new map vendor to ensure that inflight maps reflected the place naming convention recommended by the US government.

“We’re sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region and we were not previously aware of the issue,” a spokesperson for the airline told an Israeli media outlet on Sunday.

The statement from the airline continued: “After a careful review, we have decided to switch to a new map vendor. When he went to fly home with JetBlue, however, he discovered that JetBlue had canceled his ticket.

In the wake of the controversy, JetBlue [accelerated its ongoing uniform review](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/05/11/jetblue-bans-flight-attendants-from-wearing-free-palestine-flag-pins-after-altercation-with-jewish-passenger/)
 and quickly decided that customer-facing staff can only wear pin badges for countries or territories that the airline currently serves.

Several months after JetBlue’s pin badge review, Delta Air Lines also decided to ban staffers from wearing Palestine badges after accusations of antisemitism when a flight attendant was spotted wearing one of the badges.

It was initially reported that the flight attendant was breaking Delta’s uniform policy but it quickly transpired that the crew member wasn’t doing anything wrong.

Delta has, however, [now banned flight attendants from wearing Palestine pin badges](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/07/12/delta-air-changes-uniform-policy-in-the-wake-of-palestine-flag-pin-furore-that-has-left-airline-on-back-foot/)
 – a decision that angered the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) which is currently trying to unionize Delta’s crew members.

Last month, however, United Airlines [decided not intervene](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/08/29/united-airlines-refuses-to-back-down-in-decision-to-allow-flight-attendants-to-wear-palestine-flag-pins-despite-accusations-of-antisemitism/)
 when some passengers complained about seeing flight attendants wearing Palestine pin badges.

In a statement, the airline said its long-standing policy of allowing employees to wear flag pins that either designate a language they speak or which represent “pride in a place to which they may have a special connection” would remain in force.

That means that Palestine pin badges continue to be an option for United flight attendants to wear.

! We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows.”

In May, JetBlue said it would ban flight attendants and other customer-facing staff from wearing ‘Free Palestine’ pin badges after a Jewish customer accused the airline of antisemitism following a run-in with a crew member who was wearing the controversial pin badge.

Paul Faust, 54, was flying with JetBlue on a flight from Fort Lauderdale when he noticed a flight attendant wearing a ‘Free Palestine’ pin badge and decided to approach one of her colleagues to explain that Jewish passengers could find the badge offensive.

Faust says he thought the matter was over after expressing his opinion, but upon landing, he discovered that the airline had called the cops on him.

When Faust deboarded, the cops hadn’t yet arrived so he didn’t wait around but thought the matter was over. While our content provider works on making this transition, we have also asked the current vendor to adjust our onboard map so that it aligns with the U.S. <image:5310>

Late last month, Netanyahu visited the U.S. and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.

Biden laid out a three-phase [ceasefire proposal](/world/middle-east/whats-new-israel-ceasefire-proposal-biden-announced-2024-05-31/)
 in an address on May 31. sources.

One source told Axios Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.

Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.

  !People look for salvageable items following an Israeli raid in al-Mawasi area in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on June 29. <image:4093>

Protesters hold signs and smoke torches during a demonstration calling for an hostages deal and against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government on August 10. It started after a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200 people.

This round of talks is based on a three-phase proposal that [President Biden laid out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/)
 in a national address on May 31 calling for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and the reconstruction of Gaza. But [_The New York Times_ reported Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html)
 that documents show that Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks, adding new conditions to his demands. Netanyahu has denied that report.

Last week, the mediating parties called for an “urgent” new round of talks, in an attempt to kickstart stalled negotiations.

“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” a [statement from the mediators said.](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
 “It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”  

### What will these talks look like?

The talks will take place in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. has suggested, the temporary cease-fire would become permanent.

  !Protesters in Israel call for a hostage deal and demonstrate against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Aug. The two sides remain far apart on several issues.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for obstructing negotiations. Hamas instead wants a guaranteed end to the war.

There are other disagreements yet to be resolved, including whether Israel can screen Palestinian civilians returning to north Gaza to block armed militants, the number of Israeli hostages still alive to be released, the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released, and who will have control over the Philadelphi Corridor — a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt that Israel took control of in its May offensive into Rafah.

The mediating parties have downplayed these differences, calling them “[only the details of implementation](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
,” and said they are ready with a final proposal bridging the remaining issues, if necessary. Accessibility links

## Claim
Claim: "In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign."

## Actions
```
web_search("Donald Trump Benjamin Netanyahu phone call August 14 2024 Gaza ceasefire")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal (<image:4075>). The article does not mention Trump telling Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign. The article was published on August 15, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/).

Newsweek published an article discussing allegations that Donald Trump called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal (<image:4080>, <image:4081>, <image:4081>). The article states that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article mentions that the call was reported by PBS host Judy Woodruff, who said that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. The article can be found here: [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248). NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks (<image:4093>, <image:4092>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the Reuters article does not mention the specific reason for Trump's alleged request. The Newsweek article mentions that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article also mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff reported that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign.

Based on the evidence, the claim is not fully verifiable. While there is evidence of a phone call, the specific details of the conversation, as stated in the claim, are disputed.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Israel: A Record of Complicity, Not Change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

! <image:1552>

By: Melissa Garriga 

Vice President Kamala Harris has often been portrayed as a more sympathetic figure toward the plight of Palestinians, a leader who might offer a nuanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Harris has accepted over half a million dollars from the pro-Israel lobby, and her actions, along with those of President Biden, underscore the administration's unwavering support for Israel's ongoing occupation and brutal campaign in Palestine. Harris has tried to strategically position herself as distinct from President Biden on Israel's genocide campaign in Gaza, calling for a ceasefire "for at least six weeks" in March 2024. The world is watching, and history will judge her accordingly.**_

### **[Kamala: We need a ceasefire and arms embargo NOW!](https://www.codepink.org/kamalastopisrael)

* * *

_Melissa Garriga is the communications and media relations manager for CODEPINK. JDCA CEO Halie Soifer reminisced about Harris' 2017 trip to Israel, highlighting her "deep commitment to Israel's security and strong ties to the Jewish community." This trip, however, should not be romanticized—it was a clear signal of Harris's alignment with the pro-Israel lobby, a relationship that has only deepened over the years.

Harris's recent actions further illustrate her troubling stance. This selective outrage is not only hypocritical but also reveals a disturbing willingness to ignore atrocities committed by Israel while amplifying unsubstantiated claims against its Palestinians.

The [Jewish Current's 2020 article on Harris's ties to the AIPAC lobby group](https://jewishcurrents.org/restoring-the-bipartisan-consensus)
 paints an even clearer picture. Even when grassroots pressure mounted for Democratic candidates to distance themselves from AIPAC in 2019, Harris quietly met with AIPAC leaders, reaffirming her commitment to a strong U.S.-Israel alliance and combating anti-Semitism. When asked whether Israel meets international standards of human rights, Harris's response was a resounding "Overall, yes," a statement that starkly contrasts with the reality of Israel's human rights abuses.

The Vice President's stories of planting trees in Israel as a child are particularly tone-deaf."

Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. Vice President Kamala Harris campaigns in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <image:1560>

U.S. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem.

On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration.

"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect – any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy," said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations.

Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. "alliance with the Republic of North Korea."

If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging.

Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas militants carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct."

Protests kick off ahead of Netanyahu's address to Congress

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with relatives of hostages in Washington, D.C. and will speak to Congress.

President [Joe Biden](http://72837166007)
 announced Sunday he will not seek reelection in the [2024 presidential election](https://www.usatoday.com/elections/)
, and endorsed [Vice President Kamala Harris](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/kamala-harris/)
 to replace him on the ticket.

Even before [Democratic lawmakers called on the president](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/democrats-that-want-biden-drop-out-list/74448644007/)
 to end his campaign, Biden faced backlash from [young, progressive voters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/25/can-progressives-win-biden-young-voters/73347513007/)
 who wanted a [cease-fire in Gaza](https://www.usatoday.com/news/israel-war-hamas/)
 to protect Palestinian civilians.

On Oct. "It matters how."

Kamala Harris called for immediate cease-fire in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------

In March, Harris called for an "[immediate cease-fire" in Gaza](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/03/kamala-harris-immediate-ceasefire-gaza/72833162007/)
 due to the "humanitarian catastrophe." At the time, it was the most pointed call to stop the fighting from a member of the Biden administration.

At a [speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/03/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-commemorating-the-59th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday-selma-al/)

 in Selma, Alabama, Harris also called for more humanitarian aid to the region.

"What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating," she said. had been working towards a cease-fire for months, and created a framework that both sides agreed to, though there were ["gaps to close."](https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/07/12/joe-biden-calls-end-israel-hamas-war-solo-news-conference/74375638007/)

The Biden administration also tried to get humanitarian aid to the region with a $230 million floating pier, which [shut down after two months](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/07/11/us-pier-in-gaza-closes/74366780007/)
.

Reacting to Biden ending his candidacy, [Netanyahu said](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/07/22/us-ally-reaction-biden-2024-election/74494568007/)
 he plans to use his upcoming joint address to Congress "to see President Biden, whom I've known for over 40 years. 7, [Hamas-led militants attacked Israel](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/04/05/israel-hamas-six-month-anniversary-hostages/73168211007/)
, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages back to Gaza. And our common humanity compels us to act."

She also acknowledged Israel's need to address the threat Hamas poses.

Israel's PM plans to thank Biden in Congress address this week
--------------------------------------------------------------

As Biden was facing [mounting calls to step aside](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out-what-next/74463641007/)
, he defended his record and candidacy for a second term at [NATO Summit press conference](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/12/joe-biden-flubs-nato-press-conference-the-excerpt/74379067007/)
.

He said the U.S. She also came close to accusing Israel of [committing war crimes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/12/08/israel-war-crimes-gaza/71731325007/)
, saying, "international humanitarian law must be respected."

"As Israel defends itself," she said. This will be an opportunity to thank him for the things he did for Israel in the war and during his long and distinguished career in public service."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris's support for Israel is a consistent theme. The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates her support is as strong as Biden's. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, further supports this, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Kamala Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. The boughtbyzionism.org website mentions an endorsement on that date, but it does not provide a direct quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence. Additional information, such as a direct quote or a news report confirming the statement, is needed.

WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 25: U.S. (Photo by Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday afternoon, a day after he vowed to Congress that he wants “total victory” in the deadly Gaza war.

Harris said she and Netanyahu had a “constructive” meeting and that she expressed to the prime minister “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.” Harris also said she stands by a two-state solution for the region as the “only path” to peace.

“I’ve said it many times, but it bears repeating: Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said during remarks from the White House following the meeting.

“What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”

Israel’s parliament [voted](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/News/PressReleases/Pages/press18724w.aspx)
 overwhelmingly on July 18 to disapprove of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, bucking Biden’s longstanding advocacy for a two-state solution in the region.

Netanyahu’s meeting with Harris followed his afternoon meeting with Biden separately, and both then met with the families of hostages still held captive by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.

#### Harris appeals to protesters

Seemingly in reference to the uprising of protests across the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Netanyahu also met with U.S. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.

Harris said there has been “hopeful movement” for a cease-fire deal that includes the release of all hostages and a phased withdrawal of the Israeli military.

“And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu it is time to get this deal done,” she said.

#### Pressure on Harris over Gaza

 Sunday, will inevitably face demands and questions from voters, including reliably Democratic young and progressive blocs, who want to see an immediate and permanent cease-fire, and the release of all hostages.

Cease-fire negotiations have been stop-and-start for months, including on a [Biden-backed proposal](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-urges-hamas-accept-new-israeli-ceasefire-plan-intended-end-war)
 announced in May.

The death toll in the Gaza Strip has surpassed 39,000 since Israel’s offensive began nearly 10 months ago, according to Gaza health officials in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.

Netanyahu told lawmakers during a joint meeting of Congress in the U.S. stop providing aid and weapons to Israel.

Following Netanyahu’s near hour-long [address to lawmakers](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-us-backing-defeat-hamas)
, demonstrators amassed outside the city’s Union Station, where they burned American flags and graffitied the words “Hamas is coming” among other messages on a statue and fountain dedicated to Christopher Columbus, according to [numerous](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-protest-near-us-capitol-ahead-netanyahu-speech-2024-07-24/)

 [reports](https://time.com/7003081/photos-netanyahu-washington-dc-protests-demonstrations-police-clashes-arrests-capitol/)
.

Harris issued a statement Thursday morning condemning the “despicable” events outside Union Station, just under a half-mile from the Capitol.

“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. over the Gaza war, Harris asked Americans to “encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the history of the region.”

Netanyahu’s trip to Washington attracted thousands of protesters to areas surrounding Capitol Hill who demanded the U.S. <image:9563>\

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website boughtbyzionism.org ([https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit](https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit)) discusses Vice President Kamala Harris's support for Israel, referencing an endorsement by the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America on July 22, 2024, and includes an image <image:1552> of protestors. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/)) published an article on July 21, 2024, stating that Harris's support for Israel has been as strong as Biden's <image:1560>.

USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including her call for a cease-fire and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris's support for Israel is a consistent theme. The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates her support is as strong as Biden's. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, further supports this, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Kamala Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. The boughtbyzionism.org website mentions an endorsement on that date, but it does not provide a direct quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence. Additional information, such as a direct quote or a news report confirming the statement, is needed.

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee after Biden dropped out of [the election race](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/us-elections/)
 on Sunday, did not mince words about the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza after nine months of [war between Israel and Hamas militants](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
.

"We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent," she said.

Harris' remarks were sharp and serious in tone and raised the question of whether she would be more aggressive in dealing with Netanyahu if elected president on Nov. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's retaliatory attack in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people and caused a humanitarian calamity with most of the coastal enclave leveled, people displaced from their homes, famine and a shortage of emergency relief.

Biden met with Netanyahu earlier and told him that he needed to close gaps to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and remove obstacles in the flow of aid, according to a readout of the meeting provided by the White House.

Netanyahu will meet Harris' Republican rival, Donald Trump, on Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal, and as I just told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done," Harris said.

Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself, she made clear on Thursday that she was losing patience with Israel's military approach.

Democratic presidential contender strikes tough tone in public remarks following meeting with Israeli prime minister on US visit

*   [See all our Israel-Gaza war coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war)
    

Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pressed Israel’s [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 on the “dire” humanitarian situation in Gaza in talks that she described as frank, adding “I will not be silent.”

In comments that were closely watched for signs of a shift from Joe Biden’s policy approach, the US vice-president said after the meeting: “What has happened in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 over the past nine months is devastating. “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” she said.

Hours earlier, Israel’s prime minister had enjoyed a more cordial [greeting from Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/25/netanyahu-and-biden-will-meet-to-discuss-a-ceasefire-in-gaza)
 in the Oval Office, saying: “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel.”

According to a White House [account](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/25/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel/)
 of their meeting, the two leaders discussed the ceasefire and hostage negotiations “in detail”, and Biden “expressed the need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza”.

Harris’ forceful remarks on Thursday, which were sharp and serious in tone, reflected what might mark a departure from Biden in how she deals with Netanyahu. Some noted the significance of Harris being the one to give public remarks after both she and Biden had separately met the prime minister.

During the meeting, Harris brought up the repeated displacement of Palestinians since the start of the war, sparked by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 hostages were taken.

!Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with US vice-president Kamala Harris in Washington, DC on Thursday. She said Israel has “a right to defend itself and how it does so matters.”

 of Netanyahu than Biden and to focus attention on the civilian toll among Palestinians from the war in Gaza – even if she would maintain US military aid and other support for Israel that has been a mainstay of Biden’s foreign policy.

White House officials say Israel and Hamas are “closer now than we’ve been before” to reaching a ceasefire deal, with a senior administration official saying a framework for the deal had been agreed upon but that “serious implementation issues … still had to be resolved. The two men have had a strained relationship since Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory in the 2020 election, which Trump has claimed without evidence was manipulated.

Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with US vice-president Kamala Harris in Washington, DC on Thursday. “It’s a kind of like: ‘How do we close these final gaps?’”

Netanyahu promised “total victory” in the Gaza war in a raucous speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying that there were “intensive” efforts to bring the hostages home but giving little detail about how that would be achieved.

Harris – the presiding officer of the Senate – did not attend Netanyahu’s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday but released a careful statement saying that her absence should not be interpreted as a boycott of the event.

Netanyahu said on Thursday he met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Washington on Wednesday after his address to Congress. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.”

Israel’s retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.

Harris also recalled planting trees for Israel as a child and said that as a senator from California and as vice-president she has had an “unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel” and its people."

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/)) published an article on July 21, 2024, stating that Harris's support for Israel has been as strong as Biden's <image:1560>.

USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including her call for a cease-fire and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris's support for Israel is a consistent theme. The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates her support is as strong as Biden's. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, further supports this, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Kamala Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. The boughtbyzionism.org website mentions an endorsement on that date, but it does not provide a direct quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence. Additional information, such as a direct quote or a news report confirming the statement, is needed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence confirms a meeting between Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu, but it occurred on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024. During this meeting, Harris discussed Israel's right to defend itself and expressed an "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)).

The evidence does not provide the exact quote from the claim. However, the context of the meeting and Harris's statements support the idea that she would express continued support for Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely true in spirit, but the exact wording and date are not directly confirmed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
1.  The evidence indicates that DNA testing is relevant to Israeli law, particularly concerning Jewish identity and immigration.
2.  A bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel existed.
3.  The evidence does not explicitly state that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.

**Insufficient Information**: The claim's veracity cannot be determined with the provided evidence. More information is needed to ascertain whether DNA testing is illegal in Israel.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

According to the Israeli Law of Return, the Jewish people, Jewish children, Jewish grandchildren, Jewish spouses, and Jewish widowers/widows have the right to repatriate (immigrate) to Israel and automatically receive Israeli citizenship as a result. Its jurisdiction comes into force at the moment when one of the plaintiffs is not an Israeli citizen.

In general terms, the procedure of proving Jewishness based on a DNA test is as follows: an Israeli citizen issues a special power of attorney to his lawyer. The results of the DNA tests of other laboratories, especially those carried out before the relevant court decision and outside the procedure adopted and described below by Israeli law, are not recognized. If you are planning such a case, we recommend you to contact a lawyer, state the essence and, through a lawyer, consult with laboratories regarding the possibility of carrying out such DNA test and its legitimacy to obtain the right to repatriation.

  They may require clarification and more substantial evidence of Jewishness or relationship and usually do not allow resubmission of the documents.

If your documents did not convince the officials of your Jewish roots and you were denied to immigrate to Israel, do not despair as you have a way out to prove you are a Jew via a DNA test. This is not a popular myth about the “Jewish gene.” The possibility of repatriation to Israel based on the DNA test suggests that the applicant for Aliyah has Jewish relatives who are already citizens of Israel.

### Major factors in favor of repatriation to Israel on the basis of a DNA test:

1. But, if the applicant for repatriation has relatives who are already citizens of Israel, then the DNA test can serve as a basis for repatriation.
2. The procedure of proving you are a Jew or have Jewish origins based on the DNA test takes about 3 months from signing a contract with a lawyer to obtaining a court verdict and gaining approval for immigration. Even if the request for repatriation was already denied by the Israeli consulate, a positive DNA test allows you to apply to the consulate again. Exceptions can be either the identification of undeniable documentary evidence of Jewishness that was not sufficient before or the proof of Jewish roots by a DNA test.

### To illustrate how it happens, we will tell a case from our practice:

The father became a citizen of Israel in 1991, but his son remained in one of the former republics of the USSR."

Content: "According to UN figures, some 1.7 million people have been displaced, with many forced to move repeatedly in search of safety.

But the UN's children's agency, Unicef, says its biggest concern is for an estimated 19,000 children who are orphaned or have ended up alone with no adult to look after them.

"Many of these children have been found under the rubble or have lost their parents in the bombing of their home," Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications for Unicef Palestine, tells me from Rafah in southern Gaza.

Injured, hungry and alone - the Gazan children orphaned by war
==============================================================

! Hanna did not live to name her daughter.

"We just call her the daughter of Hanna Abu Amsha," says nurse Warda al-Awawda, who is caring for the tiny newborn at the al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions which some may find upsetting.**_

In the chaos caused by the ongoing fighting and with entire families almost wiped out, medics and rescuers often struggle to find carers for bereaved children.

"We have lost contact with her family," the nurse tells us. "None of her relatives have shown up and we don't know what happened to her father."

Children, who make up nearly half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, have had their lives shattered by the brutal war.

Although Israel says it strives to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing evacuation orders, more than 11,500 under-18s have been killed according to Palestinian health officials. <image:9632>!Abed Hussein who has been orphaned by the war <image:9641>

Abed Hussein, whose parents were both killed, says he can't sleep at night without them

Even when relatives can be found, they are not always well placed to help care for bereaved children.

"Let's keep in mind they are often also in a very dire situation," Mr Crickx says.

"They may have their own children to take care of and it can be difficult, if not impossible, for them to take care of these unaccompanied and separated children."

Since the war started, a non-profit organisation, SOS Children's Villages, which works locally with Unicef, says it has been working to take in 55 such children, all aged under 10. She was brought in with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder which left her unable to speak about what had happened to her and her family, but is now making progress after being welcomed with gifts and playing with other children she lives with.

Unicef believes that nearly all children in Gaza are now in need of mental health support.

With their lives shattered, even when there is a lasting ceasefire, many will be left with terrible losses that they will struggle to overcome.

The mother of this newborn baby did not live long enough to name her

**Born amid the horrors of the war in Gaza, the month-old baby girl lying in an incubator has never known a parent's embrace.**

She was delivered by Caesarean section after her mother, Hanna, was crushed in an Israeli air strike. Even more have injuries, many of them life-changing.

It is hard to get accurate figures but according to a recent report from Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, a non-profit group, more than 24,000 children have also lost one or both parents.

Ibrahim Abu Mouss, just 10 years old, suffered severe leg and stomach injuries when a missile hit his home. But his tears are for his dead mum, grandfather and sister.

"They kept telling me they were being treated upstairs in the hospital," says Ibrahim as his father clutches his hand.

"But I found out the truth when I saw photos on my dad's phone."

Dreams amid the rubble: Gaza’s women speak of homes, loss and hungry children
=============================================================================

**By** **UN News in Gaza**

21 July 2025 [Human Rights](/en/news/topic/human-rights)

Badriya collapses from hunger, Khadija dreams of her kitchen and Hiyam longs for her daughters’ laughter in the garden – these are the stories of three women from Gaza who embody the daily struggles of mothers exhausted by war, hunger and displacement as the nearly two-year-long conflict continues.

In Gaza City, families living in tents reveal a shared, grim reality.

Many have been forced to flee the fighting dozens of times. “What is my fault and my children’s fault when we are displaced from one place to another and they die of hunger?”

Hiyam's daughters eating a lunch of lentil soup, without bread, where they live, inside a destroyed building.

**Mass displacement**
---------------------

According to UN reports, more than two million Palestinians –the population of Gaza – live in about 15 per cent of the Strip’s area after the war caused widespread destruction of infrastructure and homes.

International organizations have warned that the continuation of the conflict threatens to have “catastrophic consequences” in the near term.

That includes a serious impact on children’s mental and physical health, the spread of disease and the disintegration of social structures.

This amid the absence of any clear path towards a political or humanitarian solution.

Khadija Manoun and her daughter in the space she uses as a kitchen inside a destroyed building.

**Khadija Manoun: Kitchen of life’s leftovers**
-----------------------------------------------

Khadija Manoun said she and her family have moved more than 20 times, from Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip to a destroyed building in western Gaza, in search of shelter. Clean drinking water is a luxury that Khadija chases after, running between trucks, often returning with empty containers.

Amid all this, she sometimes reminisces, scrolling through photos on her mobile phone of her old home and the meals they used to eat.

**Badriya Barawi: Exhausted by hunger**
---------------------------------------

In her modest tent on the beach west of Gaza City, Badriya Barawi, from Beit Lahia, sits, arranging what remains of her life. Her spacious, fully equipped kitchen is now just a corner in the rubble, where a solitary soap dish borrowed from a neighbour sits. Her dressing room is now home to tattered suitcases.

“This is now my closet where I put everything,” she said. How long will this life go on?”

She says her children are crying from the heat and hunger.

“We haven’t had bread for three days. This morning, I fed the children hummus, but is that enough for their stomachs?" said Ms. Barawi, who suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes.

She said she collapses daily from a lack of food.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/ "PBS News")

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

**READ MORE:** [Israeli strikes across Gaza hit multiple homes, killing at least 85 Palestinians](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-hit-multiple-homes-killing-at-least-85-palestinians)

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the exact date or the circumstances described in the claim.

Content: "Porphyrius Church in Gaza City as the Israeli army continues its attacks on the Gaza Strip, 20 April.

Omar Ashtawy APA images

Among the Palestinians killed in the West Bank during April was a man who was shot after a raid on his house in the Old City of Nablus, during which his brother was arrested, according to OCHA.

That same day, 2 April, Israeli troops [shot and killed](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin_omar_zioud)
 Omar Amer Zyoud, a 16-year-old who was reportedly among a group that threw incendiary objects at military jeeps at the entrance to Silat al-Harithiya village near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man after he allegedly threw stones at Israeli vehicles in the Bethlehem area of the southern West Bank on 3 April and confiscated his body.

A man was killed by Israeli troops searching his house when they shot at him while he was attempting to flee in his vehicle in Jenin on 4 April.

Palestinians, mostly children, receive a warm meal distributed by charitable organizations in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, 26 April. 

Omar Ashtawy APA images

On 6 April, Israeli forces [shot and killed](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/israel-kills-children-routinely-west-bank)
 Amer Rabee, a 14-year-old Palestinian American, at the entrance to Turmusayya, a town north of Ramallah in the central West Bank.

The Israeli military [claimed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-teenager-with-us-citizenship-shot-dead-by-israeli-settler-2025-04-06/)
 it had opened fire toward “terrorists” who had “hurled rocks” towards a highway.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_14_year_old_palestinian_american_boy_near_ramallah)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Amer and two other children “were picking green almonds on the agricultural land adjacent to Route 60, when Israeli soldiers started shooting at the children from a distance of about 20 meters (66 feet) away.”

“Amer was shot in the head and immediately collapsed,” the rights group added.

DCIP said that Israeli forces withheld the boy’s body, which was found to have sustained 13 bullet wounds, for around five hours. <image:8806>

Children search for salvageable items in a garbage dump that sprawls across what used to be the Firas market in Gaza City, 11 April.

On 11 April, the UN human rights office [warned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2025/04/gaza-increasing-israeli-evacuation-orders-lead-forcible-transfer)
 that “Israel appears to be inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group.”

The UN office said that “the nature and scope” of evacuation orders displacing Palestinians in Gaza “raise serious concerns that Israel intends permanently to remove the civilian population from these areas in order to create a ‘buffer zone.’”

“Permanently displacing the civilian population within occupied territory amounts to forcible transfer, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute,” the UN human rights office added.

Children gather near military remnants in the Jawazat area, which was used as the headquarters of the Palestinian police, west of Gaza City, 20 April.

Also during the month of April, the World Food Program reported that around 700,000 Palestinians in the West Bank “needed food assistance in 2024, a nearly 100 percent increase compared with the period before October 2023,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [stated](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
.

On 19 April, the Israeli military announced that one of its officers was [killed](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-04-19/ty-article/israeli-officer-killed-in-gaza-combat-idf-says/00000196-4f4a-d9fb-a79f-6fca06ce0000)
 by an explosive device in northern Gaza – the army’s first fatality since it resumed its offensive on Gaza a month earlier.

, which marked Holy Saturday during Easter celebrations, Israeli forces erected dozens of temporary checkpoints in and around Jerusalem. <image:8845>

Children pose inside the destroyed Rashad al-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City, which is being used a shelter for displaced families, 22 April.

Also on 23 April, 10 people were [killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrikes-kill-10-school-housing-displaced-families-hit-childrens-2025-04-23/)
 in an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced families were sheltering in Gaza City.

At least 26 people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza over the previous 24 hours, the health ministry said on 23 April. The boy died after nearly 20 hours in intensive care, according to Defense for Children International-Palestine, which [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_palestinian_child_with_expanding_bullet_in_jalazone_refugee_camp_raid)
 that the boy’s severe internal injuries were likely caused by expanding bullets.

These weapons have been prohibited under international law since 1868, according to Ayed Abu Eqtaish, a program director with the rights group, “due to the extreme and unnecessary suffering they cause.”

“Yet, Israeli forces use these illegal weapons against Palestinian children with no consequences from the international community,” Eqtaish added.

At least five children have been killed by expanding bullets in the West Bank since 7 October 2023, according to DCIP.

Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including a child, in the West Bank [between 15 and 21 April](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
. Israel is withholding their bodies.

[According to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
 OCHA, the deadly incident “followed the announcement of the death of a Palestinian from the village in Israeli custody … three days before he was set to be released.”

Defense for Children International-Palestine [stated](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_fatally_shoot_confiscate_body_of_16_year_old_palestinian_boy)
 that Jihad Adeli was part of a group that was ambushed by troops.

On 20 April, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian near Homesh settlement in the northern West Bank after the man reportedly opened fire towards a checkpoint near the settlement, causing no casualties.

On 23 April, Israeli forces shot and killed Mahmoud al-Haija, 12, in a cemetery in al-Yamoun, a town near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

“Mahmoud, alongside other boys and young men, were allegedly throwing stones toward Israeli soldiers deployed around the cemetery while other soldiers raided a residential building nearby,” Defense for Children International-Palestine [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_12_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin)
 in an initial report.

On 25 April, Israeli soldiers hiding behind a tree shot and killed Abdulkhaleq Jabour, 16, while he was closing up the shop where he worked during a military incursion into Salem, a town east of Nablus.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_working_at_a_shop_near_nablus)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Israeli soldiers surrounded Abdulkhaleq for at least 10 minutes while two of his relatives attempted to render first aid.

Israeli forces have killed 24 Palestinian boys and girls in the West Bank since the beginning of the year, according to the children’s rights group.

In addition to the above, on 21 April, a 48-year-old man died of a heart attack triggered by tear gas inhalation after he was assaulted by Israeli forces who accompanied settlers during a raid in the town of Sinjil near the West Bank city of Ramallah.

“During the incident, Israeli forces injured 17 other Palestinians, including four children, and Israeli settlers physically assaulted and injured three Palestinians,” according to OCHA.

And on 27 April, a man from a village near Nablus [fell to his death](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-285-west-bank)

Save the Children, a charity based in the UK, [said](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/about-130-children-born-daily-gaza-amid-total-siege-aid-and-goods)
 on 2 April that around 130 babies are being born daily in Gaza, where the health care system is on “the verge of collapse.”

“The survival of mothers and newborn children in Gaza is under particular threat due to the lack of food, destruction of hospitals and chronic stress,” the charity stated.

At least 287 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between 3 and 8 April alone, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-278-gaza-strip)
 the health ministry in the territory.

On 1 April, dozens of settlers broke into Duma village near Nablus in the northern West Bank and set fire to several vehicles, burned a chicken coop and sprayed graffiti on the walls of homes while raiding Israeli forces fired tear gas and live ammunition, injuring three people, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Palestinians in the West Bank are under increasing pressure from both settlers and the Israeli military.

On 6 April, Israeli forces demolished more than 33 structures, including 11 residential tents, and damaged water tanks and solar panels in Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar, located in an area of the West Bank’s Jordan Valley that Israel has designated as a firing zone.

The mass demolition incident displaced 33 people, including 19 children – all of whom were previously displaced from another area of the Jordan Valley due to settler violence, according to OCHA. <image:8781>

Families flee Shujaiya, east of Gaza City, following an evacuation order issued by the Israeli military on 3 April.

Also on 6 April, the UN human rights office [stated](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/un-human-rights-office-opt-alarm-over-killings-and-unlawful-use-force-local-police-gaza-amidst-deteriorating-public-order-enar)
 that it was “alarmed by the breakdown of public order in Gaza, with recent allegations of killings and unnecessary or disproportionate use of force in crowd control by local police.”

The UN office added that Gaza’s governance and law enforcement structures have been dismantled and destroyed by Israel’s attacks, “contributing to a deterioration of public order that threatens the safety of Palestinians and their access to basic services and life-saving humanitarian aid.”

Also on 6 April, Hamas said it [fired rockets](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-fires-rockets-israeli-cities-2025-04-06/)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:38>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the exact date or the circumstances described in the claim.

© AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE | 2024 | Všetky práva vyhradené. An image that social media posts say shows a Palestinian child trapped under rubble, however, actually appeared online at least eight months before the Gaza war, triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas militants against Israel on October 7. May God have mercy on them,” commented another.

However, AFP found the image circulated online months before Hamas’ October 7 attack and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza.

**Image predates war**

A reverse search on [TinEye](https://perma.cc/LLV5-F8GJ)
 found the image has been shared online as early as February 2023, eight months before the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The photo was shared by user on [X](https://perma.cc/7YHX-8864)
, formerly Twitter, on February 8 in response to a post about relief works in Syria and Turkey following a devastating [earthquake](https://perma.cc/MU4G-PSSL)
 on February 6 that killed more than 50,000 people.

A Google reverse image search found the same image had also been shared on [LinkedIn](https://perma.cc/L9XV-TPYA)
 in February 2023.

Below is a screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right):

! <image:8860>

The user on X who shared the image in February has not responded to AFP’s inquiry about its origin.

**Author(s):** AFP Bangladesh

**Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government. Long live, Long live Palestine”, reads the Bengali-language caption.

The post circulated after Hamas militants poured into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians and taking 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.

In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government.

A [truce agreement](https://perma.cc/M3X2-VPC8)
 that went into effect on November 24 has brought a temporary halt to seven weeks of fighting and saw dozens of Israeli hostages freed, with over 100 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in return.

! The image also bears visual irregularities that suggest it had been AI-generated, an expert told AFP.**

The image appearing to show a child trapped under concrete blocks was posted [here](https://perma.cc/6QFW-LYRP)
 on Facebook on October 19, 2023, and has since been shared more than 4,000 times.

“Just imagine it is your baby, how would you feel then! <image:8857>

Screenshot of the false post, taken on November 7, 2023

The image was shared alongside similar claims on Facebook [here](https://perma.cc/K7F4-BU92)
 and [here](https://perma.cc/N8H2-9QG5)
.

Comments from users suggested they believed it was genuine.

One wrote: “I feel like every bloodied Palestinian child is my child. <image:8858>

Screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right)

A visual communications expert told AFP it was “highly likely” the picture was generated with AI tools.

[Dr TJ Thomson](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/t/thomson-dr-t-j)
, a senior lecturer at Australia’s RMIT University School of Media and Communications, told AFP there were anomalies in the creases in the child’s forehead and chin, as well as the fingers on the child’s left hand.

An analysis of the image showed the child appears to have too many fingers, which are also deformed.

Despite the advancements in generative AI, errors still show up in AI-generated content."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, as the geolocation analysis suggests it was taken in Palestine. The search results also show that images of children in the context of the Gaza conflict are circulating. However, the search did not return the specific image in the claim, and the claim's details, such as the exact date and circumstances, remain unverified. The evidence also includes a debunking of a different image, which highlights the need for caution.

Therefore, the claim is still unverified due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the specific image and its context.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about children being pulled from the rubble in Turkey and Syria (<image:8752>). The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza (<image:8753>). The UN News published an article with an image of a teddy bear in the rubble (<image:8754>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:38>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the exact date or the circumstances described in the claim.


## Actions
```
web_search("image children found rubble Gaza April 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from The Electronic Intifada published in May 2025, which reports on the conflict in Gaza and includes images of destruction and the impact on civilians, including children (<image:8806>, <image:8839>, <image:8845>, <image:8777>, <image:8778>, <image:8780>, <image:8781>). Another source debunks an image of a child trapped under rubble, claiming it predates the Gaza war and shows signs of AI generation (<image:8856>, <image:8860>, <image:8857>, <image:8858>). The search also returned a source with no content.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, as the geolocation analysis suggests it was taken in Palestine. The search results also show that images of children in the context of the Gaza conflict are circulating. However, the search did not return the specific image in the claim, and the claim's details, such as the exact date and circumstances, remain unverified. The evidence also includes a debunking of a different image, which highlights the need for caution.

Therefore, the claim is still unverified due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the specific image and its context.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible, as children have been found under the rubble in Gaza, and the image's geolocation points to Palestine. However, the specific image and its context cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The search results did not return the image, and the claim's details remain unconfirmed. Therefore, the claim is considered `false`.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article states that Esmail Qaani is the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. It mentions reports of Qaani being killed in Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, but these reports were not confirmed by Iranian authorities. The article also mentions a video from June 24, 2025, showing Qaani in Tehran, which refutes the death reports. <image:k>

**ISTANBUL**

Iranian Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, was seen alive and well during celebrations Tuesday in Tehran of Iran's self-claimed victory over Israel, according to local media.

A video posted by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency showed Qaani among the crowd at the event.

“Commander Qaani attends today’s gathering of the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” the agency said on X.

State-funded Press TV also published the video, saying: “Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, was warmly received by a jubilant crowd in Tehran during victory celebrations over the Zionist (Israeli) regime.”

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Qaani was among the Iranian military leaders killed in Israeli strikes.

Israel launched airstrikes on several sites across Iran since June 13, including military and nuclear facilities, alleging that Tehran was on the verge of producing a nuclear bomb, a claim vehemently denied by Iran.

While Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, the US joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

After 12 days of aerial combat between the two regional arch-foes, US President Donald Trump announced overnight a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end their conflict. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza

The video, and screenshots from the video, were shared with similar captions across multiple platforms in March 2025.

“I’ve got zero sympathy or respect for this Zionist puppet!!” one Facebook user [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10236160829271032&set=a.1416068811808)
 while another on Bluesky [wrote](https://bsky.app/profile/paulwalker44.bsky.social/post/3ljilv7ute227)
“Libs love Zelensky. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search result from Spotlight by EBU, published on March 13, 2025, addresses a claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza. The article states that the video and images were shared online with captions falsely claiming Zelenskyy signed bombs to be dropped on Gazans. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory. The video was shared on September 23, 2024, and the handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. <image:40>

[Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-front-lines/index.html)
 and Russia exchanged aerial assaults overnight, just hours after the Kremlin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets, but stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire sought by the US.

President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump [spoke by phone](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/politics/trump-putin-ceasefire-russia-ukraine-war/index.html)
 on Tuesday, with the Russian leader not agreeing to the 30-day truce that Trump has endorsed and Ukraine has agreed to. The White House said a narrower pause on attacking energy targets would go into effect followed by negotiations over a broader ceasefire.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday accused Putin of already breaking his pledge, saying that Russia attacked Ukraine with 150 drones overnight, including strikes on energy facilities.

The Kremlin also condemned an overnight attack on an oil facility in Russia, saying it showed Ukraine’s “lack of will” to reach a deal – although Kyiv was not part of the negotiation talks, and no formal agreement has been signed.

Zelensky said Tuesday that while Kyiv supported the pause in attacks on energy targets, he wanted to know the details behind the proposal that Trump and Putin discussed in their bilateral meeting.

“Putin essentially rejected the proposal of a comprehensive ceasefire. There were strikes on transportation, unfortunately, two hospitals were hit, and on urban infrastructure,” Zelensky said during a news conference in Finland.

Meanwhile, Russia’s defense ministry said Wednesday it had shot down 57 drones launched by Ukraine overnight, with 35 of those intercepted and destroyed over the Kursk border region.

Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone had caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya, Reuters reported. According to our data, the enemy’s grouping in the Kursk direction currently consists of 70,000 soldiers.”

The commander also said that the use of guided aerial bombs and North Korean soldiers contributed to Russia’s “rapid advancement.” He said North Korean troops’ assault tactics had become more modern in recent weeks.

Content: "The "first steps toward real peace must include forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks against life,” the Ukrainian leader said.

Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight in a large-scale missile and drone attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday.

At least 10 people, including a child, were wounded, authorities said.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko described the attack as "massive" in a post on Facebook.

“Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,” Halushchenko said.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that energy supplies were a legitimate target in the war, as they were linked to Ukraine's "military industrial complex and weapons production."

The attack came hours after Zelenskyy announced that talks with the US on ending the three-year war would take place in Saudi Arabia next week.

The overnight bombardment comes days after Washington announced it would stop sharing military support and intelligence with Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for an air and sea truce on Friday after Russia bombarded Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight.

Writing on Telegram, he reiterated that there must be "silence" in the seas and skies over Ukraine. Zelenskyy has also proposed ceasing combat operations in the Black Sea to allow safe shipping.

Zelenskyy's proposals contain elements of those suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron during last week's summit of leaders in London.

In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Macron proposed a four-week truce in the "air, sea and on energy infrastructure" that would not cover fighting along the frontline in the east, as this would be complex to "monitor".

France's Foreign Minister Joel-Noel Barrot reiterated that a temporary pause would allow European allies to determine whether Russia was acting in "good faith" when committing to a true.

"That's when real peace negotiations can start," Barrot said.

Russia has not publicly commented on the French proposals for peace.

Also on Tuesday, the Ukrainian leader announced he was ready to work under US President Donald Trump's "strong leadership" to get lasting peace, signalling a turnaround from when he left the White House following a spat between the two last week.

The US temporarily paused both military aid and [intelligence](https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/05/us-puts-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-on-pause-cia-director-says)
 to Ukraine this week following the public argument, although officials suggested that the latter pause would be lifted if Ukraine quickly came back to the negotiating table.

Zelenskyy has faced intense US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, whilst he has been pushing for security guarantees for Kyiv.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter. Its final calculus will likely be shaped by Washington's position, but regardless, given its demonstrated military superiority in recent months, Israel will want to play a key role in shaping Syria’s future.

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 4, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

An Israeli source told Channel 12 news Wednesday that “a mechanism will be established, similar to the one built between Israel and Russia.” The two countries [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country and Russia provided military support for the Bashar regime in ending the country’s civil war.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told CNN Turk Wednesday that Turkey and Israel had been holding talks on the matter “when needed.”

“While we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia,” Fidan said.

### Airbase strikes

On Saturday, Reuters reported that Turkey [scoped out at least three airbases](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 in Syria where it could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact that could see new Turkish bases in central Syria and the use of Syria’s airspace, before Israel hit the sites. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

### International mediation

Both Azerbaijan and the US have offered to mediate between the two countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has referenced his country’s past role in facilitating Israeli-Turkish ties and said this week that “both countries are close friends of Azerbaijan.”

“I think, despite the legitimate concerns and the quite high level of mistrust, there can still be found grounds for normalization and areas of mutual interest,” he said at the annual ADA University Policy Forum in Baku.

‘Everything would be fine if It weren’t for the Palestinian question’

Turkey: wanting to have it both ways on Israel
==============================================

Though longstanding allies, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has grown increasingly critical of Israel’s actions towards the Palestinians, but without renouncing Ankara’s broader strategic interests.

There was a message from Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech posted on X on 30 March on the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr prayer marking the end of Ramadan: ‘We see and we know what’s happening in Palestine. Turkey’s economic success – that year it ranked 17th in the world in terms of GDP and achieved a 6% growth rate ([1](/2025/05/02turkey#nb1 "According to the International Monetary Fund.")
) – boosted its prestige in the Arab world, as did its ability to combine Islam and democracy.

So when the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Ankara sought to take advantage of that prestige to reshape the Middle East through an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had come to power in Egypt and seemed likely to do the same in Syria, or so Turkey hoped. If Ankara requested a no-fly zone in the north of Syria or took charge of the air space, it would be seen as a casus belli by the Israeli prime minister, who intends to maintain freedom to carry out airstrikes there and in Iran Player in current talks on Syria

Between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, Turkey was becoming a key site for Mossad as it looked to recruit. The Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 therefore came just as Turkey was preparing to normalise relations with Israel.

Erdoğan did not condemn the attack and rejected the use of the term ‘terrorist’, describing Hamas as a ‘group of freedom \[fighters\] who are striving to protect their lands’ ([2](/2025/05/02turkey#nb2 "Gabriel Gavin, ‘Mediator no more: Erdoğan takes aim at Israel, backing Hamas (…)")
). As activists who denounce government’s ‘hypocrisy’ acknowledge, ‘he’s doing our work for us.’ A significant part of Turkish public opinion – 45% view Hamas favourably ([3](/2025/05/02turkey#nb3 "Lena Argiri, ‘Greece makes strides in global fight against antisemitism, (…)")
) – is calling for an end to trade ties with Israel.

By demanding sanctions against Tel Aviv at the same time as the closing of an American radar station at Kürecik used by the Israelis and even for Turkish troops to be sent to Gaza, the New Welfare Party (YRP) led by Fatih Erbakan (the son of Erdoğan’s former mentor) is gaining a growing following – including within AKP ranks. Basically,’ explains Henri Barkey, emeritus professor of international relations at Lehigh University (Pennsylvania), ‘Israel and Turkey find themselves in similar situations in Syria. And political scientist Halil Karaveli believes an independent Rojava – a currently autonomous Kurdish enclave in the northeast of Syria – is all the more of a headache for Turkey given that it could ‘provide Israel with a strategic ally at the crossroads of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Levant’. That is something which would conclusively render null and void the Turkish diplomats’ maxim, ‘Everything would be fine with Israel were it not for the Palestinian question.’

Content: "We do not allow their planes to enter our airspace,” Fidan said.

The Turkish foreign minister’s condemnation comes amid years of increasingly tense relations between the two countries, said Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar.

“It’s not only about the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding in Gaza; Turkiye gradually is perceiving Israel as a national security threat,” Serdar explained, noting that Israel’s expansionism and attacks across the wider Middle East have been cause for concern.

In Syria particularly, Ankara has accused Israel of [wilfully undermining](/news/2025/8/13/turkiye-slams-israel-kurdish-led-sdf-for-destabilising-syria)
 the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the removal of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive.

“Diplomats in Ankara are seeing that if Israel is not stopped, eventually there might be a direct military confrontation between these two countries,” he said.

Serdar added that the Turkish foreign minister’s comments also show that Turkiye is looking to the Global South and other powers to take action, amid the United States’ and European Union’s largely unwavering support for Israel.

Turkish media reported last week that a ban on maritime traffic linked to Israel had been imposed, although there was no official statement. In 2023, the two countries carried out $7bn in trade.

Ankara has not minced its words about Israel’s war on Gaza, with [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](/news/2025/2/28/erdogan-says-pkk-leaders-call-to-disband-a-historic-opportunity)
 calling it a genocide – like many other world leaders and leading human rights organistions – and likening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

“We have completely cut off our trade with Israel. More and more countries and companies have decided to stop their business with Israel.”

Last November, Turkish authorities denied permission for Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane to enter Turkiye’s airspace for a trip to an international summit in Azerbaijan.

“As Turkiye, we have to take a stance on certain issues,” Erdogan later said when asked about the incident.

Israel and Turkiye’s relationship had soured as far back as 2010, following Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which killed 10 Turkish citizens.

More recently, a Turkish-American activist, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed by Israeli forces during a protest in the occupied West Bank in September 2024.

Turkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan giving a speech at the Grand National Assembly of Turkiye \[AFP\]

Published On 29 Aug 202529 Aug 2025

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and has closed its airspace to its aircraft, in protest over the war in Gaza.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Turkish parliament on [Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/8/29/live-israel-2)
 on Friday, Fidan said Israel has been “committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes”.

Turkiye cut off direct trade ties with Israel in May last year, demanding a permanent ceasefire and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to reports, Israeli vessels were banned from docking in Turkiye, and Turkish-flagged ships were not allowed to enter Israeli ports.

‘Like pariahs’
--------------

Meanwhile, Turkiye’s latest move is making “more and more Israelis feel the disadvantages of this kind of war that has no deadline”, said Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst.

“Turkiye is not just another country that is deciding to cut its relationship with Israel. We do not allow Turkish ships to go to Israeli ports. Turkiye has been an ally of Israel for many years, a very important market to Israeli goods,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, speaking from Kiryat Shmona, adding that it was also a favourite summer destination for many Israelis.

“We feel more and more … Israelis are feeling isolated and \[like\] pariahs."

A view of damaged Syrian General Staff Headquarters following multiple Israeli air strikes in central Damascus, Syria, on July 16, 2025 \[Abdulkarem Al-Mohammad/Anadolu\]

Published On 16 Jul 202516 Jul 2025

Israel has carried out powerful [air strikes](/news/2025/7/16/why-did-israel-bomb-syria-a-look-at-the-druze-and-the-violence-in-suwayda)
 near Syria’s presidential palace and on the military headquarters in the heart of Damascus, a major escalation in its bombardment of the neighbouring country.

At least three people were killed and 34 others were wounded in the [attacks on Damascus](/video/newsfeed/2025/7/16/israel-targets-syrian-government-with-attack-on-damascus-military-hq)
 on Wednesday, Syrian state media reported, citing the Ministry of Health.

While targeting Damascus, the Israeli military continued to pound areas in southern Syria, including [Suwayda](/news/2025/7/16/sectarian-tension-israeli-intervention-what-led-violence-syria)
, where a new ceasefire deal has been struck after four days of clashes between Druze armed groups, Bedouin tribes and government forces, which left hundreds dead.

Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Israeli attacks on Damascus and Suwayda were “part of a systematic Israeli policy to ignite tension and chaos and undermine security in Syria”, calling on the international community to take “urgent action” against Israeli aggression.

Israel said its bombing campaign is aimed at protecting the Druze minority, and it has called on the Syrian government to withdraw its troops from the city of Suwayda, where much of the violence has taken place.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said on X that the Israeli military would “continue to operate vigorously in Suwayda to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely”.

Later on Wednesday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the parties to the fighting in southern Syria had agreed on “specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight”.

“This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X of the ceasefire deal, reached one day after an earlier iteration had collapsed.

More than 300 people had been killed in fighting as of Wednesday morning, including four children, eight women and 165 soldiers and security forces, according to the UK-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Army withdrawal from Suwayda
----------------------------

The Syrian Ministry of Interior and Druze leader Sheikh Yousef Jarbou confirmed on Wednesday that they had reached a ceasefire. But the new deal was rejected by Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajari, another Druze leader, who promised to continue fighting until Suwayda was “entirely liberated”.

According to the ministry, the deal declares a “total and immediate halt to all military operations”, as well as the formation of a committee comprising government officials and Druze spiritual leaders to supervise its implementation.

That evening, the Syrian Ministry of Defence said it had begun withdrawing the army from Suwayda “in implementation of the terms of the adopted agreement after the end of the sweep of the city for outlaw groups”.

Speaking shortly before Rubio’s announcement of a deal, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce had said that the US wanted Syrian government forces to “withdraw their military in order to enable all sides to de-escalate and find a path forward”.

But while Syrian troops are withdrawing, the government will be maintaining a presence in the city,

Reporting from Syria’s capital Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the deal included the “deployment of government forces”.

“They will set up checkpoints, and this area will be fully integrated into the Syrian state,” she said.

A complete withdrawal by the government would, she said, “mean a failure in efforts by the new authorities to unite a fractured nation and extend its authority across Syria”.

“But staying could open a much bigger conflict with Israel that has promised more strikes if, in the words of Katz, the message wasn’t received.”

Pretext to bomb
---------------

The escalation in Syria began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between Druze armed factions and local Sunni Bedouin tribes in the southern province of Suwayda.

Government forces that intervened to restore order clashed with the Druze, with reports of the former carrying out human rights abuses, according to local monitors and analysts.

The actions committed by members of the security forces – acknowledged as “unlawful criminal acts” by the Syrian presidency – have given Israel a pretext to bombard Syria as it builds [military bases](/news/2025/2/3/satellite-images-show-israel-building-military-bases-in-syria-buffer-zone)
 in the demilitarised buffer zone with Syria seized by its forces.

Haid Haid, consulting fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera that Israel had been clear since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad last year that they did not want Syrian forces “to be deployed to the deconfliction line in southern Syria”.

“One way Israel is trying to advance that plan is to present itself as the ‘protectors’ of the Druze community,” Haid said.

Ammar Kahf, the Damascus-based executive director of the Omran Center for Strategic Studies, said: “It’s a clear message to the Syrian government that the Israelis are not going to be silent.

“The Israelis are not going to allow the Syrian government to spread its authority all over the territory.”

CNN  — 

Syria says it is withdrawing troops from a flashpoint southern city after days of deadly clashes with an [Arab minority group](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria-sectarian-clashes-druze-intl)
 that triggered military action from Israel.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the country was “not afraid of war” but had chosen to put its people “above chaos and destruction,” after his government announced a new ceasefire with the Druze, an offshoot of Islam whose followers are spread across Syria, Israel and Lebanon.

The truce followed intervention from the US as well as Israeli strikes on the Syrian capital Damascus, with Israel saying it was acting to protect the Druze.

So far, the ceasefire appears to be holding, but it is unclear whether it will last. They are made up of a network of groups with multiple figureheads.

In Syria, the Druze community is concentrated around three main provinces close to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in the south of the country, and form a majority in the Suwayda province.

More than 20,000 Druze also live in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981.

Hundreds of Druze crossed from Israel into Syria this week, apparently responding to pleas from Druze leaders to support their community in the ongoing clashes.

While Israel says its efforts aim to protect Syria’s Druze the country has also been alarmed by the Syrian government and has been trying to shore up its borders by expanding its military footprint in the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously referred to the new leaders of the country as an “extremist Islamic regime” and a threat to Israel.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed alarm over the continued escalation of violence in Suwayda, also condemning “Israel’s escalatory airstrikes on Suwayda, Daraa and in the center of Damascus,” and calling for “an immediate cessation of all violations of Syria’s sovereignty.”

At least 169 people have been killed, and 200 others injured during several days of clashes in the south, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said on Wednesday. A previous deal collapsed within hours, and a prominent Druze leader has rejected the new truce.

In a televised address to the nation early Thursday, Sharaa said the Syria was faced with two options: either “an open war” with Israel “at the cost of our Druze citizens,” or allowing Druze clerics “to return to reason and prioritize the national interest.”

He vowed to protect the rights of the Druze, many of whom are leery of Syria’s new rulers, who toppled the previous administration in an Islamist-led insurgency.

Syria said on Wednesday night local time its army started withdrawing from Suwayda, where clashes erupted over the weekend between Druze militia and Bedouin tribes, prompting government forces to intervene. Video on Syrian TV purportedly showed a convoy of military vehicles driving out of Suwayda city.

Israel’s airstrikes on Damascus targeted several government buildings Wednesday, with authorities saying at least three people were killed. One video from a Syrian television channel showed the Ministry of Defense building being hit live on air, forcing the anchor to take cover.

In his address, al-Sharaa accused Israel of trying to divide the Syrian people.

“The Israeli entity, known for its repeated attempts to destabilize us and sow division, once again seeks to turn our land into a battlefield of chaos and to dismantle the fabric of our people,” he said.

Israel has stepped up strikes against Syria despite pressure from the US, which has made moves to end the country’s international isolation following the rebel takeover.

US steps in
-----------

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Wednesday said the Trump administration had engaged with all parties of the conflict to end the clashes in Syria.

“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight. This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X.

Rubio also described the latest tension between Israel and Syria as a “misunderstanding.”

A statement published by the Syrian government said that, under the new ceasefire, there will be a complete halt to military operations, a monitoring committee will be formed with the Druze leaders and members of the community will be leading security in the province.

A Druze spiritual leader representing one of the factions in Suwayda, Youssef Jarbou, confirmed an agreement was reached for a “complete and immediate halt to all military operations and de-escalation from all sides, with the army returning to its barracks.”

However, Hikmat al-Hijri – another leading Druze figure who had asked for international protection on Wednesday – rejected the ceasefire, calling on his supporters to continue fighting, raising doubts over the truce’s longevity.

The Druze, an Arab sect of roughly one million people, practice an offshoot of Islam which permits no converts – either to or from the religion – and no intermarriage."

US says 'specific steps' agreed to end Syria violence after Israeli strikes hit Damascus

Watch: How a day of bombing unfolded in Damascus

Israel's military struck the Syrian defence ministry in Damascus and government forces in southern Syria for a third day on Wednesday, as deadly sectarian fighting in the mostly Druze province of Suweida continued.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was "working to save our Druze brothers". Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa accused Israel of causing a "large-scale escalation".

More than 350 people are reported to have been killed since Sunday, when clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes erupted in Suweida.

The Syrian military reportedly began to withdraw its forces from Suweida late on Wednesday, as the US said it had agreed "steps" to end the violence.

"We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.

Syria's state news agency, Sana, reported that troops were leaving Suweida as part of an agreement between the government and the Suweida's religious leaders, following the "completion of the army's pursuit of outlaw groups".

The Syrian foreign ministry said the country "welcomes the efforts made by the US and Arabian sides" to "resolve the current crisis" peacefully.

Israel has not yet commented on the ceasefire efforts.

The Israeli military began striking Syrian security forces and their weapons on Monday, after they were deployed to the city of Suweida for the first time since Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December.

! Netanyahu urged those with Israeli citizenship to "return to your homes and let the \[Israeli military\] take action".

Israel said the significant escalation of its bombing campaign was aimed at making the Syrian government immediately withdraw its forces from Suweida province.

Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Wednesday afternoon that "the warnings in Damascus" had ended and that the Israeli military would "continue to operate vigorously in Suweida to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely".

He later posted that "the painful blows have begun", above a video clip showing a TV presenter diving under a desk live on camera as an Israeli air strike hit the nearby entrance to the Syrian defence ministry in Umayyad Square, in central Damascus – where huge crowds celebrated Assad's downfall last year.

A separate strike on what the Israeli military called a "military target in the area" of the presidential palace underscored the severity of Israel's warning to Sharaa.

Fadi Al Halabi, a London-based Syrian filmmaker who is visiting Damascus, said he was nearby when he heard the Israeli fighter jets approach.

"People's faces were so afraid. Suddenly the air strike\[s\] began, targeting some of the most crowded areas, including the ministry of defence," he told the BBC.

The Israeli military said it also struck armoured vehicles loaded with heavy machine guns and weapons on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria.

Syria's foreign ministry said the strikes targeted government institutions and civilian facilities in Damascus and Suweida and killed "several innocent civilians".

"This flagrant assault, which forms part of a deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli entity to inflame tensions, spread chaos, and undermine security and stability in Syria, constitutes a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law," it added.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that the humanitarian situation in Suweida city had rapidly deteriorated.

It cited sources as saying there were clashes in several area of the city and that tanks had attacked the national hospital, causing panic among the scores of casualties from the fighting being treated there. <image:314>!A BBC map showing Syria, Israel, the occupied Golan Heights and Suweida city <image:315>

Minority groups including the Druze - whose religion is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs - are suspicious of Sharaa and his government, despite his pledges to protect them.

Their fears have been heightened by several outbreaks of sectarian violence over the past eight months, including one in May in which dozens of people were reportedly killed in clashes between Druze, security forces, and allied Islamist fighters in Damascus and Suweida.

In the wake of that fighting, the government reached an agreement with Druze militias to hire local security forces in Suweida province from their ranks. The continued control of Suweida by the militias sparked tensions with Bedouin tribes backed by the government.

Netanyahu has said he is committed to preventing harm to the Druze in Syria because of their deep ties to those living in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The Syrian interior ministry said a ceasefire had been agreed on Wednesday night to end the fighting in Suweida city

The fighting between Bedouin tribes and Druze militias in Suweida is said to have been sparked by the abduction of a Druze merchant on the highway to Damascus last Friday.

On Sunday, armed Druze fighters reportedly encircled and later seized a neighbourhood of Suweida city that is inhabited by Bedouin. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN and UK, but no longer by the US.

The Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country's military assets since the fall of the Assad regime.

And it has sent troops into the UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone between the occupied Golan Heights and Syria, as well as several adjoining areas and the summit of Mount Hermon.

* * * They also said there were acute shortages of water and medical supplies.

Later, the Syrian health ministry said government forces had entered the hospital and found "dozens of bodies" after "outlaw groups withdrew", according to the official Sana news agency.

A man named Hosam told the BBC he was in the centre of Suweida city and had witnessed civilians coming under fire from artillery and snipers.

"I lost my neighbour today on the street. We tried to \[get an\] ambulance \[to take\] him to hospital, but we couldn't," he said.

Other witnesses and local activists have described scenes of looting and extrajudicial killings.

The SOHR says more than 350 people have been killed since Sunday in Suweida province.

They include 79 Druze fighters and 55 civilians, 27 of whom were summarily killed by interior ministry and defence ministry forces, according to the group.

At least 189 members of the government forces and 18 Bedouin tribal fighters have also been killed in the clashes, it says.

It was not immediately possible to verify the SOHR's casualty figures, but Syrian security sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the death toll was close to 300.

The BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp90l77187zo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp90l77187zo)) reported on Israeli strikes in Syria, including the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus. The article mentions that Israel's military has been striking Syrian security forces and their weapons. <image:45>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an image of an Israeli tank, and NDTV published a fact-check on December 10, 2024, determining a claim that Israeli tanks were near Damascus to be false (<image:9743>). Al Jazeera published an article on December 8, 2024, about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights, which included an image of an Israeli tank (<image:9744>).

The sources include images of Israeli tanks, but the claim that the Israeli army reached Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is false.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:5540>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:5541>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

Advertisement

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to escalated fighting against Israel yesterday, following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by the Israeli military.

In a statement released yesterday morning, it announced "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy," which it said will be "elaborated upon" in the coming days.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Israel targets three hospitals in Gaza, says health ministry

The IDF is “besieging and directly targeting” three hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening to put them out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry said this morning.

It said the IDF was attacking the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital, and appealed to the international community to intervene "to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip."

According to the health ministry, hospital staff and at least 40 patients and wounded are trapped the Indonesian Hospital, as Israeli "artillery targeted the upper floors" of the hospital, as well as a group of displaced people in front of its gates.

The "heavy gunfire," towards the building and courtyards was "causing great panic among patients and medical staff," the health ministry said.

In a statement, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was "no intentional fire directed at it."

It said the driver of the vehicle was killed and that no Israeli soldiers were injured.

A drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the town of Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces said a drone crossing from Lebanon “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” while Israeli news outlet Ynet reported the sound of an explosion in the town.

The attack comes just days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF, but the latest strikes have provided a quick reality to check for any hopes his death could spell an end to the conflict.

At least 55 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel in the space of an hour on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the latest wave of missiles, including in the port city of Haifa which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks.

NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding non-stop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

Dramatic footage released by the Israeli military that purport to show Yahya Sinwar’s final moments will be etched in the Palestinian national memory for generations to come: the defiance of Sinwar, covered in dust and with his right arm blown off, yet still fighting.

It’s an image that brings to mind an uncomfortable comparison to Israel’s national hero Joseph Trumpeldor, the one-armed Zionist resistance fighter.

![Image:](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241019-sinwar-still-aa-f93d1a.jpg)

A video still of Sinwar in his final moments, released by the IDF. For them, this was a military commander fighting to the last, willing to sacrifice not only the lives of thousands of Israelis and tens of thousands of Palestinians — but also his own.

Reporting from Aitou, Lebanon

The scene of carnage in [northern Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/lebanon)
 showed heartbreaking snippets of everyday family life.

A dead baby inside a destroyed pickup truck; a child’s severed arm buried in nearby rubble; toddler clothing and books shredded; flies swarming as officials collected body parts, some too small for body bags ending up in clear ziplock bags.

Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials.

This was the aftermath of an airstrike Monday on the Lebanese Christian village of Aitou that Israel said had targeted a position held by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

Until then, this region of hilly olive groves and winding, sea-view roads had been a relative haven, one that felt far away from the war dominating Beirut and the country’s south.

Just last week, the area “was calm; everything was quiet,” Illy Edwan told NBC News as he surveyed the wreckage of his villa, which was reduced to rubble in the blast, its insulation and inner structure ripped to pieces, an adjacent vehicle twisted open like a burnt pretzel.

“My house used to be three-story, but look at it today,” he added.

Hundreds are dead and thousands more have been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as the IDF deepens its offensive in the area and sends more troops to fight.

The IDF laid siege to the camp 15 days ago, surrounding it with tanks while raining down artillery fire. Another person is in moderate condition after they were injured by shrapnel near the commercial center in Ein Hafaretz.

Air strikes have hit a suburb in Lebanon's capital Beirut this afternoon, less than an hour after the IDF ordered residents to evacuate the area.

Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said that a building in Haret Hreik was struck twice, and a plume of smoke was also seen rising from the area.

IDF spokesperson Avicahy Adraee had earlier given evacuation orders for the area.

Adraee issued multiple evacuation warnings today to residents in parts of southern Beirut, warning of future military operations in the area.

Spokesperson Avichay Adraee also ordered residents located in Choueifet Al-Umara and Borj El Brajneh to leave, saying they were "near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah," and urged people to evacuate.

Two patients have died inside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza due to Israel's siege on the area, according to the local health ministry.

It said the patients died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and lack of medical supplies."

In a statement earlier today, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was “no intentional fire directed at it.”

The war in Gaza "continues unabated," Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian relief said, days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, raising a fleeting hope it could bring an end to the war.

At least 20,000 people had been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as Israel deepens its offensive in the region, Lazzarini said, and there are shortages of the most basic needs, like food, water and blankets."

Israeli police sealed off the site of a reported drone attack in the northern town of Caesarea

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is undeterred from his war aims following a reported drone attack on his private residence.

"The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake," he wrote in a post on X.

His office earlier said a drone was "launched towards" his residence in the northern coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday morning.

Mr Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time, and no one was injured.

Iran says Hezbollah was behind the reported attack, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported.

Iran's mission to the UN was quoted as saying: "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon”.

Hezbollah - which is funded and equipped by Iran - has not commented on the reports.

The Israeli military said three drones were launched from Lebanon, with one hitting a building in Caesarea.

They did not confirm whether the building was part of the prime minister's residence, nor the extent of any damage.

US outlet Axios reported that the drone did hit the residence.

At 08:19 local time (06:19 BST), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: "In the last hour, three unmanned aerial vehicles crossed into the country from Lebanon.

"Two of the aircraft were intercepted.

The Israeli prime minister makes use of two private homes, in Caesarea and Jerusalem, and has also spent time at Beit Aghion, his official residence in Jerusalem, which is currently being renovated.

The reported attack comes as Israel prepares to respond to Iran's large-scale ballistic missile attack on 1 October - with Israel's defence minister saying its response would be "deadly, precise and surprising".

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. No sirens were activated during that attack."

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel&#39;s time was coming to an end and that&#39;s why they&#39;re destroying everything in the way. <image:5565>

Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel's time was coming to an end and that's why they're destroying everything in the way.

However, the truth was that Gibson had no public-facing social media accounts. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

The post apparently referenced the fact that Israel had [continued to conduct airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-b084e9c453cc99f7bec6f66d7b5913d9)
 in Gaza while at the same time preparing its military for a ground assault. Further, the first few words of the caption appeared to have been a poor translation to English by the person who created the post.

While it's true that Gibson had [expressed](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
 some anti-Semitic views in the past, the post in question was fake.

The American actor and filmmaker Mel Gibson's has issued a second apology to Jews following a confrontation with policemen during which a drunken Gibson allegedly said: "The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world", asking a police officer: "Are you a Jew?" Gibson said in a statement: "Please know from my heart that I am not an anti-Semite. The project was being created with Mel Gibson's production company, Icon. Gibson clearly is contrite, and he has made a public confession. But the third step can only be evaluated after an extended period of time." The actor is known for holding strongly conservative, Catholic views on religion and politics, and last came under fire from Jewish groups in 2004 for his movie "The Passion of Christ."

Gibson's publicist, Alan Nierob, confirmed that his client was in an "ongoing program" for his alcoholism. Gibson also said: "I am in the process of understanding where those vicious words came from during that drunken display." The sheriff's deputy who temporarily arrested Gibson last week told AP that he hopes Gibson will hesitate before drinking and driving again. Gibson," said James Mee, who is Jewish.

Content: "!Mel Gibson <image:5580>

Image caption,

Gibson said the film was put on hold because Eszterhas' script was 'substandard'

**Hollywood screenwriter Joe Eszterhas has accused Mel Gibson of shelving a movie about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee because he "hates Jews".**

Warner Bros recently halted production on The Maccabees, which Gibson was due to direct, saying Eszterhas' script lacked "a sense of triumph".

In a letter to Gibson, the writer said, "the reason you won't make \[it\] is the ugliest possible one. You hate Jews".

The actor has called the accusations "utter fabrications".

Gibson's reputation has plunged since his arrest for drink-driving in 2006, during which he made anti-Semitic comments to the arresting police officer.

He later apologised for his comments, which he blamed on alcoholism.

Eszterhas nine-page, expletive-filled letter was <link> <caption>published by film industry website The Wrap</caption> <url href="http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/joe-eszterhas-letter-mel-gibson-36949" platform="highweb"/> </link> .

In it, he accused Gibson of never having any intention to make the film.

"I believe you announced the project with great fanfare - 'a Jewish Braveheart' - in an attempt to deflect continuing charges of anti-Semitism which have dogged you, charges which have crippled your career," he wrote.

**'Substandard first draft'**

He also accused the actor of using offensive terms including "hebes", "oven-dodgers" and "Jewboys" to describe Jewish people during their time working together.

Eszterhas - who is best known for writing Basic Instinct - added, "I became increasingly worried that I'd made a grave mistake hooking up with you".

"I felt trapped. I couldn't legally or morally take it from you.

"I was hoping that the power of the story would overcome your anti-semitic prejudices."

Gibson responded to the allegations <link> <caption>in his own letter</caption> <url href="http://www.deadline.com/2012/04/mel-gibson-responds-to-the-hateful-e-mail-that-joe-eszterhass-leaked/" platform="highweb"/> </link> , saying: "I would have thought that a man of principle, as you purport to be, would have withdrawn from the project regardless of the money if you truly believed me to be the person you describe in your letter."

"I guess you only had a problem with me after Warner Brothers rejected your script."

The actor added he still wanted to make the movie, just not based on Eszterhas' script.

"Both Warner Brothers and I were extraordinarily disappointed with the draft," he said.

"In 25 years of script development I have never seen a more substandard first draft or a more significant waste of time. The success of the revolt is celebrated today by the Hanukkah festival.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland is offering protection to Benjamin Netanyahu, potentially due to an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:k>.

DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that Poland guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>. The article also stated that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event <image:k>.


## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence indicates that Poland offered protection to Netanyahu and guaranteed his safe passage, potentially due to an ICC arrest warrant.
2.  The reports are from January 2025, and the events are related to an event in Poland.
3.  The evidence does not mention anything about Netanyahu fleeing Israel amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

    The heads of the US and Israeli spy agencies - the CIA and Mossad - are due to meet with the Qatari prime minister today in Doha, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an official who has been briefed on the talks.
    
    Qatar has been acting as a mediator between Israel and Hamas for ceasefire and hostage-release talks and the US and Egypt have also been leading negotiations to end the war.
    
    The talks follow the Israeli prime minister's office announcing earlier this week that the head of Mossad had been directed to head to Doha, following "meetings that were held in Cairo".
    
    This is an apparent reference to reports that an Egyptian delegation met with Hamas leaders there as part of efforts to resume negotiations.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland is offering protection to Benjamin Netanyahu, potentially due to an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:k>.

DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that Poland guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>. The article also stated that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event <image:k>.


## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence indicates that Poland offered protection to Netanyahu and guaranteed his safe passage, potentially due to an ICC arrest warrant.
2.  The reports are from January 2025, and the events are related to an event in Poland.
3.  The evidence does not mention anything about Netanyahu fleeing Israel amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, referred to as "Operation True Promise II" according to Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)) <image:k>. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) <image:281>, <image:282> and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) <image:k> also reported on the attack. Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack, stating that Iran had "made a big mistake" and "will pay for it."


### Evidence from `web_search`
CBS News reported on an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation. The attack prompted alerts for people to take shelter across the country (<image:9809>, <image:9814>, <image:9815>). The BBC reported live updates on October 21, 2024, including an Iranian woman walking past a wall painting in Tehran (<image:9828>).

The BBC report also mentioned that on October 7, 2024, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heckled at a memorial ceremony (<image:9831>, <image:9833>). The report also mentions an Israeli strike in Sidon, Lebanon, and an incident where a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base. The report also mentions that on October 1, 2024, Iran fired missiles at Israel.


## Elaboration
1.  Evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack.
2.  The evidence shows that Netanyahu was present in Israel during and after the attack, as he vowed retaliation and was heckled at a memorial ceremony on October 7, 2024.
3.  There is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland. In fact, reports indicate that Netanyahu remained in Israel and was present at events following the attack, such as a memorial ceremony on October 7, 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/).

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
image_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

On February 3, 2002, during the halftime show of [Super Bowl XXXVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI "Super Bowl XXXVI")
, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")
", while the names of the victims were projected onto banners. The memorial is dedicated to the five individuals at the Pentagon whose remains were never found, and the partial remains of another 25 victims are buried beneath the memorial.[\[95\]](#cite_note-Cass-95)
 The names of the 184 victims of the Pentagon attack are inscribed on the memorial's side.

On September 11, 2002, the documentary play _[Bystander 9/11](/wiki/Bystander_9/11 "Bystander 9/11")
_ was performed at [Church of the Transfiguration, Episcopal (Manhattan)](/wiki/Church_of_the_Transfiguration,_Episcopal_(Manhattan) "Church of the Transfiguration, Episcopal (Manhattan)")

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

SummarizeSummariesPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
You just retrieved web sources, each one summarized under "Web Sources". **Your task right now is to summarize the web source summaries.**

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
image_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.


## Actions
```
web_search("9/11 memorials outside the US")

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.


## Actions
```
web_search("9/11 memorials outside the US")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources indicate that there are multiple 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States. These memorials are located in countries such as Australia, Canada, China, France, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom, among others. One source specifically mentions that Israel has 12 memorials. <image:9881>


# Your Analysis

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Content: "<image:9927>!YOAV LEMMER/AFP via Getty Images Image shows woman holding up picture of Hisham al-Sayed <image:9930>YOAV LEMMER/AFP via Getty Images

Hisham al-Sayed's mother holds up a photograph of her son in April 2016

**Palestinian militant group Hamas has released a video appearing to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip.**

The clip appears to show Hisham al-Sayed lying in a bed looking dazed and wearing an oxygen mask - the first sighting of him since 2015.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said releasing a video of a sick man was "reprehensible and desperate."

The BBC has not been able to independently verify the footage.

Hamas alleges that Mr al-Sayed is an Israeli soldier, but both the Israeli government and his family say he is a civilian with mental health problems.

The charity Human Rights Watch, which has criticised Mr al-Sayed's "unlawful detention" in the past, says he was last seen walking into the Gaza Strip in April 2015 for unknown reasons, having made similar attempts to cross the frontier in the past.

In the video released by Hamas the 34-year-old, who is a member of Israel's Bedouin Arab minority, could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.

A television monitor also in the room showed news footage from an economic conference in Qatar earlier this month.

No further details were given by the Palestinian militant group about the detainee's condition other than a reference on Monday to his health having deteriorated.

Israel says he is one of two citizens, the second being Avera Mengistu, currently being held captive by Hamas in violation of international law.

Both are believed to have crossed willingly into the Gaza Strip despite Israel banning its citizens from entering the Palestinian enclave.

There was some suggestion that the video's release was an attempt by Hamas to pressure Israel into resuming prisoner swap negotiations.

The two sides have engaged in prisoner swaps in the past, most notably in 2011 when abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

It is 18 months since [Israel](https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel)
 declared [war on Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-gaza)
, following the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023, which killed more than 1,100 people.

At the time of writing, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 injured from a pre-war population of 2.2 million. And on 13 April, Israel bombed [al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-bombs-one-last-functioning-hospitals-gaza)
, Gaza’s last fully functioning hospital.

More than 90 percent of health facilities in Gaza sustained some damage throughout 2024.

Witnesses to the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital said the Israeli military gave staff and patients, some of who were in intensive care, 18 minutes to leave.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)A doctor from the Red Crescent told MEE that medical staff now had to send displaced patients to other hospitals which themselves had limited care.

"All the hospitals are overcrowded and are unprepared for providing full medical services,” he said. Israel has also blockaded supplies of aid and other essentials into [Gaza since 2 March](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-blocks-all-aid-entering-gaza-following-end-first-phase-ceasefire)
.

The Palestinian dead have come from all age groups: women, children and the elderly account for 56 percent of those killed.

That high level of fatalities has also slashed the average life expectancy of Palestinians, according to a [study in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02810-1/abstract)
.

For Palestinian men, the drop in average life expectancy has been 51.6 percent to 40.5 years during the first 12 months of the war - that’s a loss of 34.9 years of life. 

For Palestinian women, it has been a cut of 38.6 percent to an average life expectancy of 47.5 years - a loss of 29.9 years. Before the war, agriculture, according to the [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/FAO-gaza-emergency-relief-food-production/en)
, accounted for “approximately 10 percent of Gaza’s economy, with more than 560,000 people relying entirely or partially on cropping, herding, or fishing for their livelihoods”.

More importantly, agriculture allowed Palestinians to feed themselves. 

That stopped with the war, as [fishing fleets](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:aff5befe-3f73-48d4-af91-201f2fcc4bf1)

 and other [necessities for](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/09e7c2a2-6a31-4ac4-88c9-deb023f14a10)
 food production were devastated by Israeli attacks.

![Food production losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza%20food%20production%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=-Hxm_-tM)

The scarcity of food has been reflected in high prices: for example, in [Deir al-Balah Governorate](https://www.solidarites.org/en/?s=gaza)
 in central Gaza, food prices soared between October 2023 and December 2024, including a kilogram of flour (1,058 by percent), tomatoes (956 percent), cucumbers (752 percent), lentils (360 percent) and rice (142 percent) among others.

In April 2025, Gaza’s [bakery owners’ association](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-bakeries-forced-close-gaza-due-lack-flour-and-fuel)
, announced that they had all shut due to a lack of flour and fuel because of Israel’s blockade.

Likewise, livestock has been hit: [milk production](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2024/02/01/gaza-fresh-milk-supply/)
, for example, has almost halted on occasion, while meat is hard to come by.

![Livestock losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza-livestock-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=4F0cszaN)

Farmer Faraj Jarudat, a farmer from northern Gaza, [told The Guardian in November 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/gaza-food-production-decimated-70-per-cent-farmland-hit)
 that he used to own three cows and 60 sheep. “There is not a single one left.”

The farm and his home, he was told by friends and former neighbours, had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.

### Malnutrition in Gaza

The lack of food that has been a constant during Israel’s war on Gaza has brought with it malnutrition.

In April 2024, Oxfam reported that Palestinians in northern Gaza were surviving on an average of 245 calories per day, or [less than one can of fava beans](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-northern-gaza-living-less-can-beans-day-report-says)
. My face is pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

The Palestinian population has often been driven to extreme measures, such as [eating grass](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-are-being-forced-eat-grass-heres-what-it-does-your-body)
, which is indigestible for humans, causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and has negligible nutritional value. On other occasions, [animal fodder](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-forced-mix-animal-fodder-flour-make-bread)
 has been used to make bread.

Many NGOs, charities, and other agencies use the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)
 to analyse food security and nutrition. The scale runs from 1 (none/minimal) to 5 (catastrophe/famine).

![Malnutrition in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-malnutrition-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=Q_cCAFdK)

In February 2025, it was estimated that at least 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for [acute malnutrition](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-4-february-2025-1500)
 in the coming year.

There have already been instances of child fatalities, including [Azzam al-Shaer](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-on-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-malnutrition-gaza-hunger-crisis-rages)
, who died in June 2024; and [Yazan al-Kafarna](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-hunger-and-malnutrition-gaza)
, who died in March 2024.

Yazan was born with cerebral palsy, meaning he had to follow a special diet and take supplements. Human waste is one of the many forms of pollution in Gaza, attracting mosquitoes that in turn can spread disease.

![Sanitation in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-sanitation%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=lM4cHkaX)

Homeless Palestinians, who usually live in tents, have little protection against insect bites and their serious effects.

In May 2024, [Omar Nasser described to MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)
 how his daughter Gada, then aged nine, had contracted hepatitis A, a liver infection that is transmitted through solid human waste and can be caught from coming into contact with unclean water or eating food handled by an infected person.

Nasser took his daughter to hospital, where a doctor prescribed some medications and a nutritional diet, which Nasser could not provide as he is unemployed.

"The doctor said she must not eat canned food, but it's the only food we get from the aid organisations," he said. “I’ve had to ask people for food to provide for my daughter.”

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Claim: "<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:61>)
web_search("Palestinian girl Gaza war oxygen mask")
image_search("Palestinian girl oxygen mask ambulance")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Jordan': 0.04, 'Israel': 0.02, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
An NPR article from April 26, 2024, discusses the death of a baby girl in Gaza who was born prematurely after her mother was killed in an Israeli airstrike. The article includes images of the baby in an incubator <image:9906> and being held by a medic <image:9907>. The BBC published an article about a video released by Hamas, which appears to show an Israeli citizen, Hisham al-Sayed, being held captive in the Gaza Strip, wearing an oxygen mask <image:9930>.

The Middle East Eye published an article on April 24, 2025, discussing the impact of the war on Gaza, including the decline in life expectancy and malnutrition. The article includes images of injured Palestinians in hospitals in December 2023 and July 2024, including one of a medic helping a woman with an oxygen mask <image:k>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image in question is of a Syrian girl holding a baby's oxygen mask, according to a source ([https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/](https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/)). Other sources show images of Palestinian girls, one in a hospital bed ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162206](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162206)) and another available on Getty Images ([https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/palestine-girl](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/palestine-girl)). <image:9955>, <image:9956>, <image:9957>


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image search reveals that the picture is of a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl. The image was misrepresented online.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl as the claim states. The image has been misrepresented. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is of a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl, and has been misrepresented online, as confirmed by an image search ([https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/](https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/)).

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

[Israel's war on Gaza](/topics/israel-war-gaza)

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)
 who was attacked by an Israeli combat dog in Gaza City and left to die by Israeli soldiers. More about MEE can be found [here](https://middleeasteye.net/about-middle-east-eye)

The dog attack, which lasted about 10 minutes, left Arian in unbearable pain and caused complications that would last for months, ultimately leading to the loss of her newborn. "It's the army," he said.

### ‘It wasn’t a regular dog’

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was not taken in Israel or Palestine, which contradicts the claim. The image's origin is more likely in countries like Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, or Romania.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)) reported an incident from December 28, 2011, where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a woman. <image:2790>

Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) published an article on January 6, 2025, about an Israeli army dog attack on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023, which resulted in the loss of her newborn. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image from China Daily of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>) and a video from Al Jazeera about an Israeli military dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>).

The China Daily image can be found here: [Source](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm). The Al Jazeera video can be found here: [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:65>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.14, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.1, 'Romania': 0.1, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Mongolia': 0.06, 'Peru': 0.06, 'India': 0.04, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Palestine': 0.04, 'Tunisia': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was not taken in Israel or Palestine, which contradicts the claim. The image's origin is more likely in countries like Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, or Romania.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.
