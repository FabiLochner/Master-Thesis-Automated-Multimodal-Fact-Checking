## Elaboration
The Kashif article ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/)) states that the image is an old photo. Therefore, the claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on August 25, 2024, is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is an old photo, and the claim misrepresents the context. The image does not depict Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the specified event. `false`
