0,"<image:1> This image shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the U.S. Army, which has died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.",False,False,True,"The claim is demonstrably false. The image is old, taken in Iraq, and does not depict General John Pagri. Furthermore, the uniform in the image was retired in 2019, and there are no credible reports of a U.S. Army general being killed in the Gaza Strip recently ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html)).
","A reverse image search reveals the photograph was uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, a website that collects free-use images, with a description that says that it was taken in 2007 in Iraq's Babil province (archived here). Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here). Several US media outlets published images of Doman from his service in Iraq, which are similar to those used in the social media posts (archived here)."
1,"<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.",False,False,True,"The claim is partially accurate. While the web search confirms the occurrence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as stated in the claim, the geolocate tool suggests that the image was most likely taken in China, not Myanmar.
","However, a reverse image search for the first photo in the post led to a TikTok video shared February 20 by a user based in Gaza. The clip shows the same destroyed building (archived link). A photo from the Turkish Anadolu news agency shows the same scene. ""A view of the destruction in Jabalia camp after Israeli forces withdrew from the area following the ceasefire in Gaza on February 05, 2025,"" the caption says. "

Multiple sources, including [kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/), confirm that the image is AI-generated or digitally created, making the claim false.
","A keyword search found a wider-angle version of the image first shared March 21 on Instagram alongside the disclaimer: ""This visual representation is an AI-generated image created for illustrative purposes"" (archived link). Watermarks that say ""in.visualart"" on the upper left side and ""designed by in.visualart"" on the lower left part have been cropped out in the circulating posts. The primary Instagram account sharing the image -- called ""in.visualart"" -- describes itself as a ""designer"" and labels its content as ""AI tools"" and ""AI-generated image"". Shu Hu, head of Purdue University's Machine Learning and Media Forensics Lab in the United States, told AFP the image was AI-generated (archived link). Hu pointed out the woman's blurry teeth in the image and said that there was ""no obvious segmentation"", one of the hallmarks of AI-generated imagery. While there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media, identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI."

","A reverse image search via Google traced the viral photo to a report published October 2, 2024 by the Mae Hong Son Immigration Office (archived link). The photo was taken during an inspection at an event celebrating Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, at a synagogue in Pai.

","However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic. He, too, noted differences in the shape of the prime minister's ear compared to the one seen in the posts."
7,The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.,False,False,True,"The claim is false.

","The militant group has said it will not halt its military operations, which come in response to Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Huthi rebels have maintained their attacks in international waters since Trump won the 2024 US presidential election -- and the group's leader has confirmed the outcome will not change its military strategy."
8,"<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.",True,False,False,"The claim is supported by evidence from multiple sources, including reports from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/26/condemnation-calls-for-restraint-world-reacts-to-israeli-strikes-on-iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/26/condemnation-calls-for-restraint-world-reacts-to-israeli-strikes-on-iran)), which confirm that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.
","In reality, the image shows a different Israeli bombardment in Lebanon. Reverse image searches on Google found a corresponding image published by Lebanese photographer Nabil Ismail alongside ten other images on his Instagram post (archived link). On the night of October 6, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) issued warnings that specified their targets in Beirut’s southern suburb (archived link). Citing official Lebanese media, AFP reported that four Israeli strikes struck south Beirut on October 6, shortly after calls by Israel's army for residents to evacuate the Hezbollah stronghold which has been bombarded for several days (archived link).

10,<image:10> This is an authentic image of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport in October 2024.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. While Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, the image's geolocation data does not support the claim that it was taken in Lebanon, and the specified date of October 2024 is in the future.

A Yahoo News article explicitly states that Halevi was not killed and made a public appearance after the claim was shared. Furthermore, The Times of Israel reported Halevi's involvement in defending the IDF's response to a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024.
","However, claims on social media that the chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) was killed in an October 13, 2024 attack on a military base are false; Herzi Halevi visited the base after the drone strike."

However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state.
","The court had instead found Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory as unlawful and said it should come to an end ""as rapidly as possible"". The ICJ said Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territories was against international law, in a nonbinding advisory opinion issued on July 19 on the request of the UN General Assembly. In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem, at the time annexed by Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt."

In 2006, Gibson apologized for antisemitic remarks made during his arrest for drunk driving in Los Angeles. Aside from that incident, there have been no recent statements from him concerning Israel amid the ongoing conflict involving Hamas and Iran. We have contacted Gibson’s publicist for a comment and will update the story upon receiving a response. It is noteworthy that this same screenshot went viral in 2023 and was debunked by Reuters and AP News.

The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.

Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
