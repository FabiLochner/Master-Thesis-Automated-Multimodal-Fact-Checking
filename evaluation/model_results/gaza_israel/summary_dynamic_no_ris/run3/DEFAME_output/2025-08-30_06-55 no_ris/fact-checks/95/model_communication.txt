### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results show images of people in orange jackets in rubble. One image from [Source](https://www.komu.com/news/nationworld/i-couldnt-save-my-daughter-behind-the-defining-image-of-the-turkey-earthquake/article_4f2535b7-4c55-5ecd-a894-03eecbcea3cf.html) shows a man in an orange jacket in rubble <image:10736>.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Turkey. The image search results show similar images of people in orange jackets in rubble, with one source specifically mentioning the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image depicts a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence points to the image being related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim is therefore false.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:62>)
image_search("man orange jacket rubble")
image_search("earthquake rubble man")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.8, 'Italy': 0.09, 'Albania': 0.01, 'Bulgaria': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Netherlands': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results show images of people in orange jackets in rubble. One image from [Source](https://www.komu.com/news/nationworld/i-couldnt-save-my-daughter-behind-the-defining-image-of-the-turkey-earthquake/article_4f2535b7-4c55-5ecd-a894-03eecbcea3cf.html) shows a man in an orange jacket in rubble <image:10736>. Another result from [Source](https://www.freepik.com/premium-ai-image/three-men-orange-jackets-are-standing-rubble-area_270908906.htm) shows three men in orange jackets in a rubble area <image:10737>.

Additionally, [Source](https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/69778534-a-man-in-an-orange-jacket-walking-his-dog-through-a-destroyed-area) contains an image of a person in an orange jacket in a destroyed area <image:10738>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows a man in an orange jacket sitting in rubble (<image:10740>). Another source contains an image of a man in rubble (<image:10741>). ABC News published an article about people surviving days in earthquake rubble (<image:10742>).

The first source is from [SBS](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo). The second source is from [Slate.com](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/05/101-year-old-man-found-in-nepal-earthquake-rubble.html). The third source is from [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/people-survive-days-earthquake-rubble-survivors-found-turkey/story?id=97035249).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Turkey. The image search results show similar images of people in orange jackets in rubble, with one source specifically mentioning the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image depicts a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence points to the image being related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely from the Turkey earthquake, not Gaza. The geolocation data and image search results support this, while the claim's context is not supported. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a man in an orange jacket in rubble, likely from the Turkey earthquake, as indicated by geolocation data and image search results, which contradicts the claim that it shows a man from Gaza. The image was likely taken in Turkey, as indicated by the [geolocation](https://www.komu.com/news/nationworld/i-couldnt-save-my-daughter-behind-the-defining-image-of-the-turkey-earthquake/article_4f2535b7-4c55-5ecd-a894-03eecbcea3cf.html) and [image search](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo) results.

The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms an Israeli attack on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

Since the evidence does not directly link the individuals in the image to the attack, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the identities of the children and their involvement in the incident. `not enough information`

Countercurrents is answerable only to our readers. At least 16 people were killed in this latest massacre at a UN school that was previously announced as a safe area by the Israeli military.

Some of the victims were displaced people from Khan Younis ordered to leave from there by the Israeli military.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:

* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza, which killed at least 16 people (<image:10757>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:10758>). The UNRWA website does not contain any relevant information.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.

On 6 June 2024, the [Israel Defense Forces](/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces")
 fired two missiles at Al-Sardi, a [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 school in the [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
. Israel had previously been criticized during the offensive for the offensive itself and airstrikes conducted by Israel, such as the [Tel Al-Sultan attack](/w/index.php?title=Tel_Al-Sultan_attack&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tel Al-Sultan attack (page does not exist)")
, in which 45–50 Palestinian civilians were killed in an area designated a "safe zone" for civilians in the [Gaza Strip](/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:5-11)
 UNRWA said 6,000 Palestinian refugees were sheltering in the school at the time of the attack.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Reuters2-12)
 Since the start of the war, more than 180 UN agency buildings have been hit and more than 450 displaced people have been killed in those facilities.[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)

Attack
------

On 6 June 2024, at approximately 2 am,[\[14\]](#cite_note-EstrinBaba-14)
[\[15\]](#cite_note-Sbair-15)
 Israeli forces targeted the classrooms on the highest floor of the Al-Sardi school in the Nuseirat refugee camp with two missiles in an airstrike.[\[2\]](#cite_note-bbc4-2)
 The strike was carried after the army declared new ground assaults and airstrikes on several refugee camps in central Gaza.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera1-16)
 The munition used in the attack was of the same variety employed in the Tel al-Sultan attack, namely a [GBU-39](/wiki/GBU-39_Small_Diameter_Bomb "GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb")
.[\[14\]](#cite_note-EstrinBaba-14)

Casualties
----------

UNRWA said 35 people had been killed, based on testimony of its employees at the school.[\[3\]](#cite_note-bbc_us-3)

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza, which killed at least 16 people (<image:10757>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:10758>). The UNRWA website does not contain any relevant information.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence from Countercurrents.org supports the claim that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024. The Wikipedia article on the Al-Sardi school attack provides additional context, confirming an Israeli airstrike on a UNRWA school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 6, 2024, with multiple casualties.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp occurred on July 6, 2024, resulting in casualties. Countercurrents.org specifically reports that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in this attack.

`true`
