TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image was likely taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. Web searches confirm that a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, as reported in [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/). The attack killed one man and wounded four others. The Guardian also reports on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel). The New York Times also reports on the Houthi drone strike in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html).

The Guardian article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack <image:2533>.


## Elaboration
The image was likely taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. Web searches confirm that a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
web_search("Houthis attack airport July 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, as reported in [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/). The attack killed one man and wounded four others. The Guardian also reports on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel). The New York Times also reports on the Houthi drone strike in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html).

The Guardian article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack <image:2533>.


## Elaboration
The image was likely taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. Web searches confirm that a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israel airport people fleeing")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about people leaving Israel, including an image of people at an airport (<image:10699>). The Times of Israel also published an image of people at an Israeli airport (<image:10702>). The Guardian published an article about panic at an Israeli airport, including an image of people at the airport (<image:10704>).


## Elaboration
The image search results confirm that people are at Israeli airports. However, none of the provided images match the original image. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2578242/middle-east): 
Content: The search result from Arab News contains an image of an airplane at an airport. <image:10729>


## Elaboration
The image search for "Israel airport July 19 2024" did not return any images that match the original image. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop.

For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City.

Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable.

Israel-Gaza: On board the plane evacuating injured Palestinians

Palestinians disembark an evacuation flight that has taken them from Egypt to the UAE

**Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering.**

The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds.

Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai.

After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

"During the war they were displaced," she tells me. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza.

I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.

At the time of writing, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 injured from a pre-war population of 2.2 million. And on 13 April, Israel bombed [al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-bombs-one-last-functioning-hospitals-gaza)
, Gaza’s last fully functioning hospital.

More than 90 percent of health facilities in Gaza sustained some damage throughout 2024.

Witnesses to the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital said the Israeli military gave staff and patients, some of who were in intensive care, 18 minutes to leave.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)A doctor from the Red Crescent told MEE that medical staff now had to send displaced patients to other hospitals which themselves had limited care.

"All the hospitals are overcrowded and are unprepared for providing full medical services,” he said. Israel has also blockaded supplies of aid and other essentials into [Gaza since 2 March](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-blocks-all-aid-entering-gaza-following-end-first-phase-ceasefire)
.

The Palestinian dead have come from all age groups: women, children and the elderly account for 56 percent of those killed.

That high level of fatalities has also slashed the average life expectancy of Palestinians, according to a [study in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02810-1/abstract)
.

For Palestinian men, the drop in average life expectancy has been 51.6 percent to 40.5 years during the first 12 months of the war - that’s a loss of 34.9 years of life. 

For Palestinian women, it has been a cut of 38.6 percent to an average life expectancy of 47.5 years - a loss of 29.9 years. Before the war, agriculture, according to the [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/FAO-gaza-emergency-relief-food-production/en)
, accounted for “approximately 10 percent of Gaza’s economy, with more than 560,000 people relying entirely or partially on cropping, herding, or fishing for their livelihoods”.

More importantly, agriculture allowed Palestinians to feed themselves. 

That stopped with the war, as [fishing fleets](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:aff5befe-3f73-48d4-af91-201f2fcc4bf1)

 and other [necessities for](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/09e7c2a2-6a31-4ac4-88c9-deb023f14a10)
 food production were devastated by Israeli attacks.

![Food production losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza%20food%20production%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=-Hxm_-tM)

The scarcity of food has been reflected in high prices: for example, in [Deir al-Balah Governorate](https://www.solidarites.org/en/?s=gaza)
 in central Gaza, food prices soared between October 2023 and December 2024, including a kilogram of flour (1,058 by percent), tomatoes (956 percent), cucumbers (752 percent), lentils (360 percent) and rice (142 percent) among others.

In April 2025, Gaza’s [bakery owners’ association](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-bakeries-forced-close-gaza-due-lack-flour-and-fuel)
, announced that they had all shut due to a lack of flour and fuel because of Israel’s blockade.

Likewise, livestock has been hit: [milk production](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2024/02/01/gaza-fresh-milk-supply/)
, for example, has almost halted on occasion, while meat is hard to come by.

![Livestock losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza-livestock-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=4F0cszaN)

Farmer Faraj Jarudat, a farmer from northern Gaza, [told The Guardian in November 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/gaza-food-production-decimated-70-per-cent-farmland-hit)
 that he used to own three cows and 60 sheep. “There is not a single one left.”

The farm and his home, he was told by friends and former neighbours, had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.

### Malnutrition in Gaza

The lack of food that has been a constant during Israel’s war on Gaza has brought with it malnutrition.

In April 2024, Oxfam reported that Palestinians in northern Gaza were surviving on an average of 245 calories per day, or [less than one can of fava beans](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-northern-gaza-living-less-can-beans-day-report-says)
. My face is pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

The Palestinian population has often been driven to extreme measures, such as [eating grass](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-are-being-forced-eat-grass-heres-what-it-does-your-body)
, which is indigestible for humans, causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and has negligible nutritional value. On other occasions, [animal fodder](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-forced-mix-animal-fodder-flour-make-bread)
 has been used to make bread.

Many NGOs, charities, and other agencies use the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)
 to analyse food security and nutrition. The scale runs from 1 (none/minimal) to 5 (catastrophe/famine).

![Malnutrition in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-malnutrition-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=Q_cCAFdK)

In February 2025, it was estimated that at least 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for [acute malnutrition](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-4-february-2025-1500)
 in the coming year.

There have already been instances of child fatalities, including [Azzam al-Shaer](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-on-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-malnutrition-gaza-hunger-crisis-rages)
, who died in June 2024; and [Yazan al-Kafarna](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-hunger-and-malnutrition-gaza)
, who died in March 2024.

Yazan was born with cerebral palsy, meaning he had to follow a special diet and take supplements. Human waste is one of the many forms of pollution in Gaza, attracting mosquitoes that in turn can spread disease.

![Sanitation in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-sanitation%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=lM4cHkaX)

Homeless Palestinians, who usually live in tents, have little protection against insect bites and their serious effects.

In May 2024, [Omar Nasser described to MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)
 how his daughter Gada, then aged nine, had contracted hepatitis A, a liver infection that is transmitted through solid human waste and can be caught from coming into contact with unclean water or eating food handled by an infected person.

Nasser took his daughter to hospital, where a doctor prescribed some medications and a nutritional diet, which Nasser could not provide as he is unemployed.

"The doctor said she must not eat canned food, but it's the only food we get from the aid organisations," he said. “I’ve had to ask people for food to provide for my daughter.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine. The web search results mention the Gaza war and images of injured Palestinians, including children, in hospitals. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the girl holding her sister's oxygen mask or the sister's death. The Middle East Eye article mentions images from July 2024, which aligns with the claim's timeframe.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.

The Middle East Eye article from April 24, 2025, discusses the impact of the war on Gaza, including images of injured Palestinians in hospitals in December 2023 and July 2024 (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine. The web search results mention the Gaza war and images of injured Palestinians, including children, in hospitals. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the girl holding her sister's oxygen mask or the sister's death. The Middle East Eye article mentions images from July 2024, which aligns with the claim's timeframe.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.

Content: "I had to move my hand to show them that I was alive."

Doctors in Gaza saved his life and Majd spent months in hospital, breathing through a tracheostomy tube, before he was evacuated to Egypt in February this year - with Israel's permission - for further medical treatment.

Now he's in the UK for surgery at Great Ormond Street children's hospital in London to restore the function of his face.

He is the first Gazan child to arrive in the UK for treatment for war injuries, almost two years into a conflict in which more than 50,000 children have reportedly been killed or injured, [according to the UN children's charity, Unicef](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip)
.

'They thought I was dead', Majd tells the BBC

His arrival follows months of work by a group of volunteer medical professionals who came together in November 2023 to set up Project Pure Hope, which helps injured and sick Gazan children get to the UK for treatment. It's our collective moral responsibility."

Doctors from the hospital have previously treated patients from Ukraine, and last year helped separate co-joined twins in Israel.

Professor Jeelani is disappointed that it has taken so long for the first child from Gaza to be treated for war injuries in the UK.

"As a doctor and as a human, I don't quite understand why it's taken us over 20 months to get to this stage," he says.

Project Pure Hope has identified 30 critically injured children in Gaza who it hopes to help bring to the UK. It is funded by private donations.

"The UK is home to some of the best paediatric facilities in the world, yet while countries like the US, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and many others have stepped up to help, the UK has yet to do the same," Project Pure Hope says.

Majd's evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.

"We certainly saw a much easier process of evacuation to other countries," said Alisa Kireeva, its executive director.

Majd's arrival in the UK comes less than a week after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer [promised to evacuate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5v5568mzro)
 more badly injured children, although the government has released few details of the plan.

Majd's medical team – all working for free – will include craniofacial, plastic and orthodontic surgeons, with hospital bills paid for by private donations.

"If we're able to give him a face and a jaw which he can use then it won't be completely normal, but hopefully he'll be able to feed himself and speak, and his facial expressions will be better," says lead surgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani, a professor of Paediatric Neurosurgery at Great Ormond Street.

"Hopefully that's going to make a big impact on how he lives and on his future.

"Our hope is that we will be able to help many more children like him in the coming months. <image:10762>!BBC Majd arriving at Heathrow airport <image:10763>BBC

Majd al-Shaghnobi arrives at Heathrow airport in London

Majd al-Shaghnobi can't eat or speak or smile like he used to.

But with his injured mouth covered by a surgical mask, his eyes were beaming as he arrived at London's Heathrow airport on a flight from Cairo, with his mother, brother and little sister.

"I'm happy to be in England and to get treatment," the 15-year-old told me.

He was trying to get humanitarian aid in the Kuwaiti area of northern Gaza in February last year when an Israeli tank shell exploded nearby, shattering his jaw bone and injuring his leg.

"One of my friends helped me and took me to the hospital," he says. "I just want them to be safe."

Gazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuries

! It says the government's announcement is "vital and long-overdue", but time is of the essence.

"Every day of delay risks the lives and futures of children who deserve a chance to live, to recover and to rebuild a life," said Omar Din, its co-founder.

In April, the group of volunteers secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - with life-long medical conditions to also have privately funded operations in the UK.

They were [brought to London](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgpy75v0nxo)
 after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza, where - with the destruction of the healthcare system there - they weren't receiving the treatment they needed.

Since I met them in early May, Rama has put on weight and Ghena, who was deeply traumatised and withdrawn, is noticeably more playful.

Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing. <image:10762>!Ghena guitar <image:10767>

Ghena was at risk of losing her left eye

Both girls are doing well, their mothers say.

But they are sick with worry - finding it hard to eat and sleep - about family members left behind in Gaza, who are now struggling to feed themselves.

"It's better than Gaza here," Rama tells me. "There are no bombs and no fear."

But friends message her from Gaza, telling her that they haven't found bread for 10 days and she says her older brother is sleeping on the street after first his home, and then his tent, were bombed.

"They're hungry."

CNN  — 

An Israeli strike killed 15 people, including women and children, gathered outside a health center in the central Gazan city of [Deir Al Balah](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/gaza-winter-palestinians-intl-latam)
 on Thursday, according to medical staff and officials in the enclave.

The Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in [Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/middleeast/gaza-fuel-babies-incubator-intl)
 said eight of those killed in the strike were children, with the youngest under two years old, according to his mother, and the oldest aged 14. The hospital said three women and four men were also killed.

In footage obtained by CNN, several children were seen lying motionless and others appeared injured amid the sound of screams. I was so happy to hear his first words.”

Her nine-year-old remains in critical condition, she also said.

The bodies of two children lie on the floor of Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al Balah on Thursday.

The director general of Gaza’s health ministry said the strike hit near a medical center dispensing children’s formula to women.

Project HOPE, an American aid organization, said the strike occurred “directly in front” of one of its health clinics, where people were waiting to receive treatment for “malnutrition, infections, chronic illnesses, and more.”

The organization’s CEO Rabih Torbay told CNN the location of the clinic had been shared with the Israeli military. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimize harm as much as possible,” the Israeli military said in a statement to CNN.

The youngest victim of the strike was 17-month-old Mohammad, whose mother Donia Halhoul told CNN she had been waiting to receive food aid for her children from the health center when the deadly strikes landed.

“I’m in so much pain all over my body, but what hurt me more is that Mohammad died hungry while I was waiting to get him and his siblings nutritional supplements,” she told CNN by phone from the hospital.

”He was so young that he had only started to say a few words before he was killed. “It was a deconflicted site,” Torbay said.

“Project HOPE’s health clinics are a place of refuge in Gaza where people bring their small children, women access pregnancy and postpartum care, people receive treatment for malnutrition, and more,” he said in a statement.

“Yet, this morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open,” he continued. Speaking to CNN from Al Mawasi in southern Gaza, Mughaisib stressed that there has been no improvement in access to aid and medicine despite Israel’s [partial lifting](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/middleeast/us-israel-aid-gaza-looting-intl)
 of the blockade on Gaza.

“Every day there is hundreds of people killed and injured when they are going (to the aid distribution points) to pick their food kits or parcels,” he said adding, “In the market you don’t find food. I mean, the bakeries are closed.”

Israel has intensified its strikes and expanded a ground operation on parts of Gaza as negotiators in Doha [continue talks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/politics/netanyahu-trump-gaza-ceasefire-deal)
 to release hostages, establish a temporary truce and allow the entry of more humanitarian aid to the devastated strip.

Almost 3,000 Palestinians were killed over the past month in Gaza, according to the enclave’s health ministry.

Meanwhile, Hamas have continued conducting guerilla-style attacks against the Israeli military, killing more than 20 soldiers in different parts of the strip over the same period, including five soldiers killed this week in the northern city of Beit Hanoun.

On Thursday, a 20-year-old Israeli man was killed in an attack at the Gush Etzion junction south of Jerusalem, according to the Israeli military and medical services.

The IDF said two Palestinian “terrorists” had “conducted a combined shooting and stabbing attack” before being “eliminated.” Gush Etzion is a settlement cluster in the occupied West Bank.

A security source later told CNN that the two attackers were Palestinian Authority policemen with no prior records in Israel or prior arrests."

They represent the latest group of children brought to the Bay Area for medical treatment by a group called HEAL Palestine.

Just getting them to the Bay Area was a major challenge, the group said.

"The logistics of getting them out is also a nightmare," said Talha Baquar with HEAL Palestine. He said the medical situation in Gaza has become desperate because hospitals are in shambles.

"The ones that had reopened were running on bare minimum, fumes," he said. He suffered injuries to his legs and will be treated at a hospital in Oakland. One of the children who's coming today, he's been on a waitlist to get out. He's had his medical visa since November of last year."

Among those who welcomed the children at San Francisco International Airport was Dr. Mohammed Subeh, an emergency room doctor who has traveled to Gaza multiple times to help. He actually treated two of the three children when he was last there."

The provided evidence includes images of children receiving oxygen and being treated in hospitals.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("girl holding oxygen mask Gaza war")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The first source is from a fact-checking website that shows the image in the claim with a red "X" over it, indicating it is being misrepresented online. The second source is an Al Jazeera article from August 25, 2010, featuring an image of a girl wearing an oxygen mask (<image:10775>).


## Elaboration
The image search results indicate that the image in the claim is being misrepresented online. The first result is from a fact-checking website that shows the image with a red "X" over it. This suggests that the claim is false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image has been misrepresented online, and the claim is not factually accurate. The image is being used out of context. `false`

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:61>)
web_search("Palestinian girl Gaza war oxygen mask")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Jordan': 0.04, 'Israel': 0.02, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article from April 26, 2024, discusses the death of a baby girl in Gaza who died after her mother was killed in an Israeli airstrike (<image:10731>, <image:10732>, <image:10733>). The BBC article from February 22, 2024, shows images of Palestinian children being evacuated (<image:10746>, <image:10748>). The Middle East Eye article from April 24, 2025, discusses the impact of the war on Gaza, including images of injured Palestinians in hospitals in December 2023 and July 2024 (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine. The web search results mention the Gaza war and images of injured Palestinians, including children, in hospitals. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the girl holding her sister's oxygen mask or the sister's death. The Middle East Eye article mentions images from July 2024, which aligns with the claim's timeframe.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("Palestinian children Gaza war oxygen mask")

## Evidence

The CNN article from July 21, 2025, reports on an Israeli strike in Gaza on July 10, 2025, that killed 15 people, including children, near a health center in Deir Al Balah, and includes images of injured children. The NBC Bay Area article from August 6, 2025, reports that three children injured in the Gaza war arrived in the Bay Area for treatment.

The articles mention the impact of the war on children, including injuries and the need for medical treatment. The articles also mention the challenges of getting the children out of Gaza. The articles include images of injured children and the bodies of children. (<image:10763>, <image:10765>, <image:10767>, <image:10731>, <image:10732>, <image:10733>, <image:10768>)

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost, according to shopisrael.com ([https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X)).

Variety ([https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/)) mentions that Johnson, along with other Hollywood stars, has expressed support for Israel amid the conflict. <image:0>, <image:2699>, <image:2700>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
image_search("dog with flashlight on head")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web search results from iStockphoto, Getty Images, and Dreamstime.com show images of elderly women with dogs.

Dreamstime.com offers stock photos, including one of an elderly couple walking a dog on a beach (<image:10846>).


## Elaboration
The web search results show various images of elderly women with dogs, including images of them hugging, interacting, and walking with dogs. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. The search results do not provide any information to verify the claim.

The claim's veracity remains unconfirmed.

Your email address will not be published. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog.

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Anadolu Agency, Morocco World News, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) published articles about Israeli army dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. Anadolu Agency reported an attack on Dawlat al-Tanani in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, with the attack occurring during a 20-day Israeli military attack from May 12 to May 31, 2024. Morocco World News reported an attack in Jabalia refugee camp, with the woman, Dawlat Al Tanani, stating the dog bit her because she was resisting eviction. PCHR reported an attack on May 14, 2024, where a dog bit a 58-year-old woman's shoulder. The PCHR article includes a video from Al Jazeera.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs attacked elderly Palestinian women in May 2024. The attacks occurred in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp. The claim's date of June 2024 is close to the reported attacks in May 2024. However, the evidence does not provide the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is plausible, but the authenticity of the image cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs attacked elderly Palestinian women in May 2024, which is close to the claimed date of June 2024. However, the specific image in the claim has not been found in the search results. Therefore, while the event is plausible, the image's authenticity cannot be verified. `false`
