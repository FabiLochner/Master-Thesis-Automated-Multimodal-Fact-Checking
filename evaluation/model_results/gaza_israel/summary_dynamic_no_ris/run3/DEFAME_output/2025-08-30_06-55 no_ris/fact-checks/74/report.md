## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a drone attack occurred on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel. However, the evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack, and there were no injuries reported.

The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.

Based on the available information, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, but it also explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack.

The claim is demonstrably false because the evidence contradicts the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack. `false`

The evidence does not support the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.
