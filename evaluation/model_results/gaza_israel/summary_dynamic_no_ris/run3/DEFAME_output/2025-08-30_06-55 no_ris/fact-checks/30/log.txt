Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_and_killing_of_the_Bibas_family): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the kidnapping and killing of the Bibas family. It mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed by an Israeli airstrike, while Israel stated they were killed by their captors. The article also mentions that the bodies of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas were returned on February 20, 2025, and that forensic analysis showed they were killed with "bare hands". <image:21> shows the image of the BBC article. The article also includes images of the Bibas family home and Shiri Bibas with her children.

The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The BBC did publish an article on February 21, 2025, discussing the Bibas family, as confirmed by a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry3jzedl1o) and a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_and_killing_of_the_Bibas_family). The article covered the conflicting claims of Hamas and Israel regarding the family's death. However, the exact title of the article cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
