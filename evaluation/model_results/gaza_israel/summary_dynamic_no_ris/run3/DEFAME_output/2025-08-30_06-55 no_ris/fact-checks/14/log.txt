Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04m913m49o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on September 20, 2024, discussing explosions in Lebanon involving communication devices, some used by Hezbollah. The explosions killed at least 32 people and injured thousands. The article mentions that the explosions occurred in multiple locations, including Beirut. The article includes images of the aftermath of the explosions <image:10090>, <image:10093>, <image:10091>. The article also mentions that the devices used were walkie-talkies and pagers.

Useful result: From [Source](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/): 
Content: The search result, published on October 11, 2024, discusses the explosion of Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon and Syria on September 17, 2024. The article suggests that Israel was responsible for the attacks. The pagers, distributed to Hezbollah operatives, contained explosives. The explosions destroyed Hezbollah's communication apparatus.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-23452/hezbollah-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-causing-nearly-3-000-casualties): 
Content: The NPR article, published on September 17, 2024, reports that electronic pagers belonging to Hezbollah members exploded simultaneously on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least nine people and wounding around 2,800 across Lebanon. <image:10095>, <image:10096>, <image:10098>. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the attacks.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows the aftermath of an explosion of a Hezbollah pager in Lebanon in September 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts a damaged toilet in Hong Kong from 2020, as confirmed by a fact-check from [Factly](https://factly.in/an-old-image-from-2020-of-a-damaged-toilet-in-hong-kong-is-falsely-shared-as-a-recent-hezbollah-incident-in-lebanon/). While Hezbollah pager explosions did occur in Lebanon in September 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04m913m49o) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-23452/hezbollah-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-causing-nearly-3-000-casualties), the image does not depict the aftermath of those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
