The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence.

The meeting on July 25th is documented by the New Jersey Monitor, Reuters, and The Guardian.

So, the overall veracity is: false
