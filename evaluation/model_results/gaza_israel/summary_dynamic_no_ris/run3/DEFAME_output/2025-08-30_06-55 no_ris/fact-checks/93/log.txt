Useful result: From [Source](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2578242/middle-east): 
Content: The search result from Arab News contains an image of an airplane at an airport. <image:10729>

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the image is likely taken in Israel, and a Houthi attack occurred on July 19, 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. Image searches did not yield any matching images.

So, the overall veracity is: false
