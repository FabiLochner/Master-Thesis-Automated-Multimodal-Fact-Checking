## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) published an article about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, mentioning Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's statement about the attack. ![image 10287](media/2025-08-30_07-05-1756537513-488995.jpg), ![image 10288](media/2025-08-30_07-05-1756537514-003931.jpg)

Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/israeli-defense-minister-yoav-gallant-170813925.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/israeli-defense-minister-yoav-gallant-170813925.html)), published by USA TODAY, states that the claim "Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant killed during Iranian missile attack" is false. ![image 10291](media/2025-08-30_07-05-1756537523-024870.jpg) The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant)) reported that Benjamin Netanyahu fired Yoav Gallant on November 5, 2024. ![image 10300](media/2025-08-30_07-05-1756537537-109293.jpg), ![image 10301](media/2025-08-30_07-05-1756537538-001277.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Yahoo News, published by USA TODAY, explicitly states that the claim "Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant killed during Iranian missile attack" is false ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/israeli-defense-minister-yoav-gallant-170813925.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/israeli-defense-minister-yoav-gallant-170813925.html)). Furthermore, The Guardian reported that Gallant was fired on November 5, 2024 ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant)), which would not be possible if he had been killed in an attack on October 1, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple reliable sources, including Yahoo News and The Guardian, contradicts the claim that Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack. Yahoo News explicitly states the claim is false, and The Guardian reports Gallant was fired after the alleged attack date.

`false`
