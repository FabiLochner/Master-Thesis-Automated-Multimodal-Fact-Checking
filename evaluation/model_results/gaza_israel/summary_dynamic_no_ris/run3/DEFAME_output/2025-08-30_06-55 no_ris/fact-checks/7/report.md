## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from the Atlantic Council, published on March 18, 2025, discusses the US approach toward the Houthis, mentioning that Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 15, 2025, and that Russia has aided Houthi operations (![image 635](media/2025-07-18_21-20-1752873629-385726.jpg), ![image 637](media/2025-07-18_21-20-1752873641-091924.jpg), ![image 638](media/2025-07-18_21-20-1752873641-843828.jpg)). An ABC News article from July 8, 2025, reports that Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea in July 2025, after ceasing attacks in late 2024 following US airstrikes. The article also mentions occasional missile attacks targeting Israel.

A Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions the 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and the 2024 Houthi drone attack on Israel, the 2024 Israeli attacks on Yemen, and the March–May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen. It also mentions that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the "2025 United States–Houthi ceasefire" states that a ceasefire between the United States and the Houthi movement in Yemen took hold on May 6, 2025, brokered by Oman, ending the March–May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen (<image:i>). The PBS News article, published on August 24, 2025, reports on Israeli airstrikes in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, following Houthi rebel attacks (![image 10056](media/2025-08-30_06-57-1756537039-185039.jpg)).

An article from the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, published on August 27, 2024, discusses the ongoing conflict in Yemen, mentioning that the Houthis continued to target ships and attempted to strike Eilat with missiles and drones, including a drone attack on Tel Aviv. In December 2023, the United States and its allies launched Operation “Prosperity Guardian” to counter Houthi actions. In July 2024, an economic de-escalation agreement was announced between Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the Houthi group (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. Instead, the Houthis continued attacks, including targeting ships and launching missiles. The evidence also shows that the US, under Trump, ordered airstrikes against the Houthis in March 2025. A ceasefire between the US and the Houthis was brokered on May 6, 2025. However, the Houthis resumed attacks in July 2025.

The claim is therefore demonstrably false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. Instead, they continued attacks, and the US, under Trump, ordered airstrikes against them. A ceasefire was brokered in May 2025, but the Houthis resumed attacks in July 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774)) indicates that the Houthis continued military operations after Trump's election, including attacks on ships and missile launches, and that the US, under Trump, conducted airstrikes. A ceasefire was brokered in May 2025, but attacks resumed in July 2025.
