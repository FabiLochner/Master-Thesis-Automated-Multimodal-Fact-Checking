The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the image is associated with Sham Imad Muhareb and the Gaza conflict, the evidence, including a report from Quds News Network, indicates that she lost her right hand in an Israeli bombing, which is not visible in the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
