As to whether it’s going to spread beyond that, I would not expect that to happen, but I do think that the Israeli/Lebanon dimension of this is going to get very serious very quickly, with already Israeli towns and cities targeted, with the Israelis warning in the southern suburbs of Beirut that the people need to evacuate there, because that’s where Hezbollah headquarters are.

[\[5\]](#cite_note-jsource-6)

The helicopters rendezvoused 12 kilometers off the Lebanese coast before moving towards Beirut. Anticipating the possibility that the airport could not be secured for an evacuation, an alternative exit by sea was planned. Another Bell helicopter, flown by [Eliezer Cohen](/wiki/Eliezer_Cohen "Eliezer Cohen")
, dropped 20 smoke flares and 95 smoke grenades in front of the buildings to obscure the commandos from the view of the terminal and control tower, then dropped nails on the roads leading to the airport, which halted six approaching cars. Vehicles in the airport trying to escape and emergency vehicles rushing to the scene subsequently created a traffic jam which served as an effective block. At one point, he spotted an apparent military truck trying to evade the jam and enter the airport and fired warning shots at it, causing it to come to a halt.[\[4\]](#cite_note-historicwings-5)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 ([https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/)). The Wikipedia article discusses the 1968 Israeli raid on Beirut Airport ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport. ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960)) <image:10053> The BBC News website contains an image of a large explosion. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo)) <image:10054>

Al Jazeera published an article on October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut, including an image of a plane taking off over the city. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/5/live-israel-resumes-beirut-bombing-as-lebanon-death-toll-passes-2000](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/5/live-israel-resumes-beirut-bombing-as-lebanon-death-toll-passes-2000)) <image:10055>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Brookings article discusses Israeli warplanes bombing Beirut ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/)). The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 ([https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/)). The Wikipedia article discusses the 1968 Israeli raid on Beirut Airport ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport)). The image <image:10>

### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport. ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960)) <image:10053> The BBC News website contains an image of a large explosion. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo)) <image:10054>

Al Jazeera published an article on October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut, including an image of a plane taking off over the city. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/5/live-israel-resumes-beirut-bombing-as-lebanon-death-toll-passes-2000](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/5/live-israel-resumes-beirut-bombing-as-lebanon-death-toll-passes-2000)) <image:10055>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

    Weapons storage facilities belonging to the Iran-backed group were hit in Beirut, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says.
    
    Secondary explosions happened after the initial strikes, indicating weapons were stored in the facilities.

    The Israeli air force also struck targets in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa area, it adds.

BEIRUT — Israel's military announced Sunday it is now taking aim at the Lebanon-based Hezbollah's financial arm and will attack a “large number of targets” in Beirut and elsewhere. AP video showed strikes near Lebanon’s only airport but it continued to operate.

The strikes will target al-Qard al-Hassan "all over Lebanon,” a senior Israeli intelligence official said. <image:10192>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

“AQAH is a cash-based organization. A stream of people left the areas surrounding its branches in Beirut.

In one evacuation notice, for the Choueifat area south of Beirut, the Israeli military mislabeled one target, causing confusion and panic. The location was labeled as Grand Cinema ABC Verdun, a theater in an upscale shopping mall in central Beirut more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.

A year of escalating tensions and frequent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the war in Gaza turned into all-out war last month. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called civilian casualties in Lebanon “far too high” in the Israel-Hezbollah war, and urged Israel to scale back some strikes, especially in and around Beirut. 

### Lebanese army says 3 soldiers killed in Israeli strike

Israel has increased strikes on southern neighborhoods of Beirut known as the Dahiyeh, a crowded residential area where Hezbollah has a strong presence."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Brookings article discusses Israeli warplanes bombing Beirut ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/)). The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 ([https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

The BBC News website reports on Israeli air strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut on October 6 and 7, 2024, with multiple secondary explosions, and includes images of the strikes. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c748xq4lgzyt](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c748xq4lgzyt)) <image:10175>, <image:10177>, <image:10182> NPR published an article on October 20, 2024, stating that Israel launched airstrikes on Beirut, targeting Hezbollah's financial arm, and includes an image of flames and smoke near the airport.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Brookings article discusses Israeli warplanes bombing Beirut ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/)). The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 ([https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/)).

The image <image:10>

### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport. ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960)) <image:10053> The BBC News website contains an image of a large explosion.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

India Today Fact Check, however, found that this photo is AI-generated.

**Our Probe**

Reverse searching the photo led us to an [**Instagram post**](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 dated October 21. Along with the viral photo, the post contained another similar picture of a flight landing amid an explosion. A comparison between the two can be seen below.

We used the AI detection tool [**Hive Moderation**](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection)
, which stated there was a 91.7 per cent chance of it being generated using AI. We noticed several discrepancies in the aeroplane, such as the design of the tail and the blurred-out portion of the plane's body. *   [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/ "India Today")

> 
> **Fact**: The viral image is AI-generated and does not show a real incident from Beirut International Airport. It was uploaded on the Instagram account “eyesoflebanon” on 21 October 2024, with a caption confirming it as an AI-generated image. Hence, the claim made in the post is **FALSE**.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Taiwan': 0.28, 'Japan': 0.14, 'France': 0.07, 'Belgium': 0.04, 'Monaco': 0.04, 'Portugal': 0.04, 'China': 0.03, 'South Korea': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Bulgaria': 0.02}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Brookings article discusses Israeli warplanes bombing Beirut ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/)). The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 ([https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/)). The Wikipedia article discusses the 1968 Israeli raid on Beirut Airport ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport)). The image <image:10>

### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport. ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960)) <image:10053> The BBC News website contains an image of a large explosion. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo)) <image:10054>

Al Jazeera published an article on October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut, including an image of a plane taking off over the city.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

MEA plane in front of fireball, violent strike on Ghobeiri: What do we know about these viral photos?

Smoke billows after an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs, near the Beirut airport, Oct. <image:10275>](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1432132/israeli-army-prepares-to-attack-al-qard-al-hassan-branches-issues-15-evacuation-orders.html)

These images, which have been shared hundreds of times, should be approached with caution.

According to the "Is it AI" software, there is nearly a 90 percent chance that the image of the plane landing amid flames is fabricated. Lebanese photographer Rami Rizk posted a quick analysis on X, demonstrating that the image appears to have been generated by artificial intelligence, citing a blurred area on the aircraft's fuselage and the lights on the tarmac that do not correspond to the reality of the setting.

While the image may be AI-generated, it reflects a troubling reality in Lebanon: MEA planes continue to land at Beirut Airport, despite the ongoing and often violent airstrikes on the southern suburbs.

On Sunday night, the Israeli military conducted a series of airstrikes targeting branches of the Hezbollah-affiliated Qard al-Hassan foundation. At least twelve Israeli strikes hit locations in Beirut's southern suburbs, including Haret Hreik, Tahwitat el-Ghadir, Hay al-Sellom, Ghobeiri, Burj Barajneh, Amrousieh and Mreijeh, as well as areas south of the capital in Choueifat (Aley district)."

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

Nasrallah only very rarely made public appearances during his 32-year tenure atop a group that several nations, [including](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/lebanese_hizballah_fto.html#:~:text=The%20US%20State%20Department%20designated,entirety%E2%80%94as%20a%20terrorist%20group.)

Israel's military says several airstrikes Friday in central Beirut have killed the long-time leader of the Hezbollah militant group, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)
, in what represents another dramatic new development in a conflict that has metastasized across the Middle East region since last October.

In a statement Saturday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Nasrallah and offered condolences for others killed with him “following the treacherous Zionist raid on the southern suburb.”

The airstrikes Friday had leveled several large residential buildings in southern Beirut, which Israeli officials had almost immediately labeled the headquarters of Hezbollah in statements they issued even as the smoke and debris clouds from the explosion rose above the city.

The Lebanese health ministry announced late Friday that six people had died and more than 90 had been injured by the strikes, but authorities said they were still clearing vast quantities of rubble, meaning those numbers would likely rise.

Denial, terror and bravado in Beirut as residents await next Israeli air attack
===============================================================================

Casualties rising as assault on Hezbollah leaves war-weary nation apprehensive of more pain to come

For months, the staff at Rafik Hariri university hospital had been preparing for the worst. Hospitals in Dahiya transferred patients to Rafik Hariri and other surrounding medical centres after the ministry of health ordered the evacuation of all hospitals in the southern suburbs.

Rubble where Israeli strikes targeted and killed Hassan Nasrallah in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood of southern Beirut. [Dozens of bombs were dropped on Dahiya](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/israel-air-attack-beirut-lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah)
, the southern suburbs of Beirut, sending residents running to the safest place they could think of – the nearby hospital.

People ran to the gates of Rafik Hariri hospital, asking to stay in the car park until the bombing ceased. Staff could not let them in because they had to keep the way clear for incoming wounded and were expecting hundreds of casualties from the airstrikes, which [killed the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
, and levelled a city block. I’m scared that if the situation continues, we will be cut off from everything,” Shoshana Mazraani, the emergency room director of Marjayoun public hospital in south Lebanon, said.

Amir’s neighbour agreed with him that the late leader of Hezbollah, who during [his three-decade command of the group](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/hassan-nasrallah-obituary)
 achieved mythical status among supporters and enemies alike, was not dead. If we’re facing 10 of them, there will be hundred of us,” Amir said, saying that despite the fact that he was Sunni, he supported what he saw as the Shia organisation’s defence of Lebanon against Israel.

Even if some Lebanese might face the prospect of an Israeli invasion with bravado, there were doubts as to whether the Lebanese state was prepared for it.

“They said they had been preparing for a year, but look what happened last Friday."

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday that last week’s Iranian ballistic missile attack “didn’t even scratch” the Israeli Air Force’s capabilities, and vowed that Israel would not be deterred from responding to such attacks by its enemies.

During a visit to Nevatim Airbase, which suffered damage during the attack, Gallant said Israel would choose the manner and time of its response, and that this should be taken not just as a statement of intent, but as a working plan, according to a statement from his office.

“The Iranians have not even scratched the capabilities of the Air Force. However, the attack sent 10 million Israelis rushing for cover and caused damage to civilian structures as well, including a school.

“Whoever thinks that by trying to attack Israel he will deter us from reacting, should look at what is happening in Gaza and what is happening in Beirut — things are very clear,” Gallant said referring to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip and the intense Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese capital.

[! (Jack Guez / AFP)

“We are strong both in defense and attack and we will express it in the way we choose, at the time we choose, in the place we choose, and these things are for us… not just a statement… but a work plan,” he declared.

Gallant’s remarks came the day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has a “[duty and a right](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-israel-has-a-duty-and-right-to-hit-back-at-iran-over-missile-attack/)
” to respond to the Iranian assault.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the missiles were fired to avenge the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan in a September 27 IAF strike on Beirut. The IRGC also said the attack was meant to avenge the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in an explosion for which Israel has not claimed responsibility.

As Israeli leaders repeatedly vow to retaliate for the Tuesday evening missiles, Iran has prepared a plan to respond to a possible Israeli attack, local Iranian media reported.

“The plan for the necessary response to a possible action by the Zionists has been fully prepared,” Tasnim news agency said Sunday, quoting “an informed source” in the armed forces.

“If Israel takes action, there will be no doubt that an Iranian counterattack will be carried out,” said Tasnim.

It added that Iran “has a list of many Israeli targets,” and said Iran’s attack on Tuesday “showed that it can level to the ground any place it desires.”

In April, the Islamic Republic fired some 300 missiles and drones at Israel, after an airstrike killed several Iranian generals in Damascus. (Dor Pazuelo/Flash90)

Iranian Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad visited an oil facility on Kharg Island on Sunday and met with employees, his ministry’s news agency, SHANA, reported.

“We are not afraid that our enemies will ignite a crisis, and visiting the region is a normal business trip,” Paknejad said on state television.

Kharg Island, located in the Gulf, is home to Iran’s largest crude oil export terminal.

On Saturday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned of a “proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger” if Israel attacks.

US President Joe Biden on Friday advised Israel against [targeting oil sites](https://www.timesofisrael.com/biden-says-israel-should-consider-alternatives-to-hitting-irans-oil-fields/)
 in Iran, one of the world’s 10 largest oil producers.

Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has decorated the Revolutionary Guard’s aerospace commander for the Islamic Republic’s missile attacks on Israel, the ayatollah’s website said.

From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant): 
Content: "The prosecutor’s office of the international criminal court is seeking an arrest warrant for both men over Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza.

Benny Gantz, a major Netanyahu rival, former defence minister and leader of the centre-right National Unity party, joined the prime minister’s three-man war cabinet alongside Gallant after the 7 October Hamas attack, but he [resigned in June](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/09/moderate-politician-benny-gantz-resigns-israeli-war-cabinet)
, saying Netanyahu was “preventing us from progressing towards a true victory”.

Gantz described the move as “politics at the expense of national security”.

It is possible that the prime minister could shutter the war cabinet and revert to a former model in which security issues are discussed in a limited forum before being presented at regular cabinet meetings.

A White House spokesperson praised Gallant as an “important partner” and said the US would “continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defence”.

However, a senior US official said it had “real questions about the reasons for Gallant’s firing and about what is driving the decision”, the Israeli paper Haaretz reported. The two Ultra-Orthodox parties in the Knesset, Netanyahu’s longstanding allies, are obdurately opposed to the new policy.

In a statement late on Tuesday, Gallant said his dismissal was triggered by disputes over Ultra-Orthodox conscription, Israel’s “moral obligation to return the hostages” and the need for a full inquiry to learn lessons of the 7 October terror attacks.

Gallant had also publicly dismissed Netanyahu’s oft-repeated goal of “total victory” over Hamas, saying that Israel’s military success had created the conditions for a diplomatic deal. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Benjamin Netanyahu fires defence minister Yoav Gallant, triggering protests across Israel
=========================================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Demonstrators in Tel Aviv and outside PM’s home condemn sacking of Gallant, widely seen by Israel’s allies as a brake on far-right elements of Israeli government

The Israeli prime minister, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
, has fired his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, a figure widely considered by Israel’s international allies to be a brake on the far-right elements of the country’s coalition government, prompting protests around Israel.

Netanyahu said in a video statement late on Tuesday that “significant gaps on handling the battle” in Gaza had emerged.

“At the height of a war, complete trust is needed between the prime minister and the defence minister … In recent months, that trust between me and the defence minister was damaged,” he said. The leader of the centre-right New Hope, Gideon Saar, who rejoined Netanyahu’s coalition in September, will serve as foreign minister.

Katz posted on X: “We will work together to march the security system to victory against our enemies and to achieve the goals of the war: the return of all the abductees as the most important value mission, the destruction  
of Hamas in Gaza, the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the containment of  
Iranian aggression and the return of the residents of the north and  
south to their homes in safety.”

'Trust has cracked': Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu fires defence minister – video

Within hours, thousands of protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv, pounding drums and blocking the city’s main highway. One protester wore handcuffs and a face mask with Netanyahu’s likeness, while others wore “Bring them home now!” T-shirts in reference to Gaza-held hostages.

“We, the protesters, believe that Gallant … is actually the only normal person in the government,” said teacher Samuel Miller, 54, condemning Netanyahu’s government for opening “new fronts in uncalled-for wars”.

Netanyahu had been at odds with Gallant since his latest coalition entered office at the end of 2022, when the defence minister became the only senior government figure [opposed to planned judicial reforms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/13/israel-prepares-for-vote-related-to-judicial-reform-plan)
 that critics said amounted to democratic backsliding.

His dismissal was long expected. It quoted the official as saying Netanyahu’s decision was “surprising” and “concerning, especially in the middle of two wars and as Israel prepares to defend against a potential attack from Iran”.

In Gaza, the World Health Organization said it hoped the biggest medical evacuation from the territory since the war broke out would get under way on Wednesday, with 113 seriously ill and injured patients expected to leave via Israel for treatment in the United Arab Emirates and Romania.

About 14,000 people are in urgent need of medical care outside Gaza, according to WHO data. Israeli forces have waged a renewed ground and aerial offensive on the area since early October, which it says is necessary to mop up Hamas cells that have regrouped.

Sweeping evacuation orders for the 400,000 people whom the UN estimates still live there, the blockade of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure including the three remaining and struggling hospitals have led rights groups to accuse Israel of the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population.

Israel has denied it is systematically removing Palestinians from the area or using food as a weapon, both of which are illegal under international law.

At least 30 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Tuesday, including eight women and six children in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. The Israeli military said it had targeted a weapons storage facility.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

“Israel was also pursuing \[a\] political goal with this act, aiming to disrupt the first day of the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prioritized strengthening peace and stability in the region, and enhancing cooperation and constructive engagement with international community,” Iravani added.

Earlier today, US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”

Wood said that although the US was not involved with Israel’s response on July 30 in Lebanon, “there is no doubt absolutely none that Hezbollah was responsible for this attack, which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah.”

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in the past day, following the killing by Israel of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the provided image depicts the assassination. The image geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Cambodia, Pakistan, or other countries, while the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran.

The evidence indicates that the assassination was caused by an explosion in his guesthouse. The image shows a building with a damaged facade, but it is not possible to determine if this is the location of the assassination.

Therefore, the claim is unverified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.

## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the provided image depicts the assassination. The image geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Cambodia, Pakistan, or other countries, while the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran.

The evidence indicates that the assassination was caused by an explosion in his guesthouse. The image shows a building with a damaged facade, but it is not possible to determine if this is the location of the assassination.

Therefore, the claim is unverified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, but the provided image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in a different country than where the assassination occurred. The evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the assassination.

**ANKARA**

An online image of the compound in Tehran where Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated is recent and was taken after the attack, Anadolu's investigation has confirmed.

Following the killing on early Wednesday, discussions quickly began about the location and security of the guest house where the Hamas political bureau chief was targeted.

Iranian social media users pointed out that the area is near the Saadabad Complex in northern Tehran.

Some semi-official sources, including news groups close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), also started sharing visuals of the location.

The photograph shows that an upper-floor apartment of the building was hit. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. It is situated adjacent to the northern wooded area surrounding the Saadabad Complex, which is known for its concentration of museums and historical structures.

Satellite photos show the building where Haniyeh was staying has a large facade that faces partially towards the city, but predominantly towards the mountains.

Due to its height and open surrounding, the structure is easily visible from afar.

**Security beefed up before assassination**

Residents living around the complex built in the early 1900s said they had no information if Haniyeh was staying there, but had noticed increased security measures two days before the assassination.

Many roads, usually open, were closed to traffic, they told Anadolu.

A resident said convoys of dozens of vehicles accompanied by special guards were entering and leaving the compound over the past two days.

Describing the strike that killed Haniyeh, a resident said: "We heard a sound around 2 a.m. That damaged part of the structure has now been covered with a tarp, and debris can be seen on the ground.

Anadolu's comparison of the structure and location of the building in the photograph with open-access satellite imagery verifies that it is not doctored.

The building in the photo is located within the compound said to be protected by the IRGC."

Ismail Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the inauguration of its new president

Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed with a "short-range projectile" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says.

The paramilitary organisation said the projectile weighed about 7kg (16lbs) and caused a "strong blast", killing Haniyeh and his bodyguard last Wednesday. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.

The IRGC account is at odds with reports in Western media, which have suggested that explosives were planted in the guesthouse by Israeli operatives.

The failures surrounding Haniyeh's death, especially on a day marked by intense security, have caused embarrassment for Iran and the IRGC.

Dozens of IRGC officers have been arrested or dismissed in the days since Haniyeh's death, the New York Times reported on Saturday.

The paper said the organisation's intelligence agency had taken over the investigation. Staff members at Haniyeh's guesthouse have been interrogated and their phones and other electronics have been seized, it added.

Meanwhile, the security details of Iranian politicians have been overhauled. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh on Thursday, but was whisked away soon after the ceremony by his security detail.

The IRGC's statement on Saturday came after Britain's Daily Telegraph said Haniyeh was killed by bombs planted in his room by agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency

Citing Iranian officials, the paper said two Mossad agents had entered the guesthouse and planted explosives in three rooms. The Iranians, who had viewed CCTV footage of the operatives, said the two subsequently left the country before detonating the bombs from outside Iran.

The New York Times also reported that Haniyeh was killed by explosives detonated in his room, saying they could have been planted up to two months earlier. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.

But Hamas officials told the BBC earlier this week that Haniyeh had stayed at the same guesthouse before. Experts also said it would highlight the degree to which Mossad can operate with impunity in Iran.

Regardless of the manner of Haniyeh's death, both Iran and Hamas have vowed to retaliate.

The IRGC said on Saturday that Israel would receive "a severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner".

Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group in Lebanon, has also vowed reprisals. One of their top commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike last Tuesday.

After an Israeli operation killed IRGC Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Damascus earlier this year, Iran fired 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and at least 110 ballistic missiles towards Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that "challenging days lie ahead... But US President Joe Biden admitted on Friday that Haniyeh's death had damaged the talks.

Haniyeh was heavily involved in negotiations and Mr Biden said his death “doesn’t help” efforts to end the ten-month old conflict.

The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,550 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media)) reports that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated. ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229)) published an article about Ismail Haniyeh. CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk)) reports that Ismail Haniyeh was killed. <image:10337>, <image:10338>, <image:10339>


## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the provided image depicts the assassination. The image geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Cambodia, Pakistan, or other countries, while the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran.

The evidence indicates that the assassination was caused by an explosion in his guesthouse. The image shows a building with a damaged facade, but it is not possible to determine if this is the location of the assassination.

Therefore, the claim is unverified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.

From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg64642q0dxo): 
Content: The BBC reports that Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed with a "short-range projectile" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran, according to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The IRGC said the projectile weighed about 7kg (16lbs) and caused a "strong blast", killing Haniyeh and his bodyguard. <image:10365>, <image:10366> The IRGC account is at odds with reports in Western media, which have suggested that explosives were planted in the guesthouse by Israeli operatives.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. The provided image does not depict the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence shows that the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran, and the image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in a different country. Furthermore, the evidence includes an image of the actual building where the assassination took place, which does not match the image in the claim.

ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229)) published an article about Ismail Haniyeh. CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk)) reports that Ismail Haniyeh was killed. <image:10337>, <image:10338>, <image:10339>


## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the provided image depicts the assassination. The image geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Cambodia, Pakistan, or other countries, while the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran.

The evidence indicates that the assassination was caused by an explosion in his guesthouse. The image shows a building with a damaged facade, but it is not possible to determine if this is the location of the assassination.

Therefore, the claim is unverified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination image")
image_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination site")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Anadolu Agency published an article confirming an online image of the compound in Tehran where Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated is recent and was taken after the attack. The building is near the Saadabad Complex in northern Tehran. The BBC reports that Haniyeh was killed by a "short-range projectile" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran. The IRGC said the projectile weighed about 7kg and caused a "strong blast". <image:1>, <image:10365>, <image:10366>


### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an image of the building where Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated (<image:10384>). Al Jazeera reports that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, on July 31, 2024 (<image:10385>).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The provided image does not depict the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence shows that the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran, and the image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in a different country. Furthermore, the evidence includes an image of the actual building where the assassination took place, which does not match the image in the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial evidence indicated that the image's location was not in Iran, where the assassination occurred. Further investigation revealed an image of the actual building where the assassination took place, which does not match the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. While Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, on July 31, 2024, the image provided does not depict the assassination site. The image's geolocation data suggests a different location, and the actual building where the assassination occurred is different from the one in the image, as confirmed by sources like CNN and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media)).

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:10429>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep. Pingback: [James Baldwin on Black-Jewish Relations, Israel and the United States – Tony Greenstein demo](https://demo.tonygreenstein.com/james-baldwin-on-black-jewish-relations-israel-and-the-united-states/)
    
8. 

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon this week during [escalated fighting](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd)

U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon this week during escalated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah

.

Other countries, from Greece to the United Kingdom, Japan and Colombia, have arranged flights or sent military planes to ferry out their citizens.

As Israeli bombardments targeting senior Hezbollah leaders shook southern neighborhoods in Lebanon's capital last week, “We could still see, hear and feel everything” despite fleeing to the mountains outside Beirut, said Nicolette Hutcherson, a longtime humanitarian volunteer living in Lebanon with her husband and three children.

The only seats Hutcherson's family could find on commercial carriers were for flights weeks away and for thousands of dollars, she said. Family members said he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

“He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,” she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising them to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said relatives who are U.S. Limits on withdrawing money from banks due to [Lebanon’s longstanding economic collapse](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-war-economy-d5433642fcfce79facf8a1369b14d0f0)
 and intermittent electricity and internet have made it difficult, they said.

Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a lawyer based in Washington, paid $5,000 to get a female relative on the last seat of a flight out of Beirut on Saturday.

“She was on her way to the airport” when Israeli began one of its first days of intensified bombing, Abou-Chedid said.

By Thursday, some Americans said their loved ones had been able to secure tickets for upcoming flights and were hopeful.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon’s flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

Miller said the embassy is prepared to offer temporary loans to Americans who choose to remain in Lebanon but want to relocate to a potentially safer area of the country. Iran on Tuesday [fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da)
 toward Israel, leaving the region bracing for any Israeli retaliation and fearing an all-out regional war.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, attacked Israel on Oct."

The U.S. government will provide charter flights to cities in Europe, White House spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. It is unclear how long the offer will last but it might just a few days, airline officials said.

A State Department email seen by Reuters said it plans to offer transit options beginning on Friday "but it will take some period of time to schedule everyone seeking to depart."

" If you choose to take this departure assistance, transportation will be by air to Athens or Frankfurt, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus," it added.

Senate Majority Chuck Schumer praised the announcement but said "these transports must be increased as needed to ensure Americans in Israel who want to can return to the United States."

Newsweek AI is in beta. State Department has begun "assisted departure flights" for U.S. embassy in Israel directed _Newsweek_ to the State Department's media inquiry form.

**Why It Matters**
------------------

Over the past few days, the conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated dramatically, with Trump calling for the evacuation of Tehran, Iran's capital city home to over 9.5 million people.

Israel initially struck Tehran and several other cities in "Operation Rising Lion," a campaign it said was meant to preempt a planned Iranian attack and disrupt Iran's nuclear capabilities.

Iran, which has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, has since retaliated, though Israeli defense systems—bolstered by [U.S. military](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/u.s.-military)
 technology—have intercepted about 99 percent of incoming missile fire, according to Israeli officials on Saturday morning in an X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter)
, post. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump is expected to make a decision about whether to directly support Israel in its attacks against Iran within the next two weeks.

**What To Know**
----------------

The State Department on Saturday issued a notice with information for U.S. citizens and lawful residents in Iran and Israel on how to leave the countries.

It said, "The Department of State has begun assisted departure flights from Israel," but did not provide further details, including the number or origin of the flights. The State Department has not responded to _Newsweek's_ request for comment as of Saturday afternoon.

The government hasn't offered such flights since the beginning of the war between [Hamas](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/hamas)
 and Israel that started on October 7, 2023.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict. The U.S. government has also been providing assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens and lawful residents from Israel since October 2023, including charter flights.

The claim that the U.S. government is offering loans for flights out of Lebanon is supported by the evidence. The claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence, which states that the U.S. has been assisting U.S. citizens and lawful residents from Israel since October 2023.

The claim is partially accurate.

Content: "<image:10439>!AFP People and first responders gather at the scene of a reported device explosion in Sidon, in southern Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:10441>AFP

Explosions were reported in southern Lebanon, including the city of Sidon, as well as Beirut's southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley

At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the country’s health ministry says.

Walkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds.

Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members’ pagers exploded on Tuesday. <image:10439>!Reuters Mourners carry the coffin of Hezbollah fighter Mohammed Ammar, son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar, during his funeral in Beirut, Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:10443>Reuters

Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people killed by exploding pagers on Tuesday, who included Hezbollah fighter Mohammed Ammar

Wednesday's deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel.

Many Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group.

Twelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister.

A BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT).

There was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well.

[One unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast](https://x.com/lbci_news/status/1836419137385492606)
 during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds.

The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capital’s southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.

The health ministry said the deadly explosions "targeted walkie-talkies". <image:10439>!Getty Images Remains of an ICOM walkie talkie following an explosion at a house on the outskirts of Baalbek, in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:10445>Getty Images

An ICOM-branded walkie talkie was destroyed by a blast at a house on the outskirts of Baalbek

Reuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought.

[The Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack)
 before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the group’s war-time emergency communications system.

The BBC asked ICOM's UK arm to comment on the reports, but it referred all media requests to the company's press office in Japan.

Second wave of Lebanon device explosions kills 20 and wounds 450

! Israel has not commented.

The attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a "new phase in the war" and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north.

UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of the “serious risk of a dramatic escalation” and called on all parties to “exercise maximum restraint”.

"Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation," he told reporters.

---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cy80nwggdz8o)

There were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Hours after Wednesday’s explosions, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country “securely to their homes”.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was “opening a new phase in the war” and that the “centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces”.

An army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed.

Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends.

An indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech.

Hezbollah's media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions.

It also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions.

The Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries.

It said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.

! A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up.

Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley.

It identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM.

NNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous," Dr Elias Warrak said.

"Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes - some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage.”

UN appeals for restraint after further devices explode across Lebanon
=====================================================================

18 September 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for an end to the escalation in violence in the Middle East amid reports of a fresh wave of electronic device detonations in Lebanon which caused further deaths and injuries. 

International media reported that walkie-talkies used by members of the Hezbollah militant group blew up on Wednesday, a day after hundreds of pagers across the country exploded simultaneously.

Mr. Guterres was deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded in Lebanon and Syria over the past two days, his Spokesperson said in [a statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-09-18/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-lebanon)
.

At least 11 people were killed, including children – and thousands more injured.

**Stop the fighting, restore stability**
----------------------------------------

“The Secretary-General urges all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation,” the statement said.

Tweet URL

> [](https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/statuses/1836414396014223796)

He also called for the parties to recommit to the full implementation of UN [Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)](https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=S%2FRes%2F1701(2006)&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=False)
 and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities to restore stability.

Adopted in August 2006, the resolution aimed at ending the war that erupted that year between Israel and Hezbollah, on Lebanese soil.  It calls for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone.

The statement concluded by saying **the UN “supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region.”**

**De-escalation ‘more crucial than ever’: UN rights chief**
-----------------------------------------------------------

The device detonations are occurring against the backdrop of the war in Gaza and attacks last year in Lebanon, the Syrian Golan Heights and Iran, linked to the conflict.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, also issued [a statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2024/09/comment-un-high-commissioner-human-rights-volker-turk-explosions-across-lebanon)
 deploring the widespread simultaneous explosions and stressing the need for de-escalation.

“At this extremely volatile time, I appeal to all States with influence in the region and beyond to take immediate measures to avert further widening of the current conflicts - enough of the daily horrors, enough of the suffering,” he said.

“It is high time leaders stepped up in defence of the rights of all people to live in peace and security. Turk said “simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, **without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law** and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law.”

 He called for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation and for those who ordered and carried out the attacks to be held to account.

The UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon also warned against the danger of escalation.

"Pained by casualties inflicted today due to more explosions of devices, I can only reiterate my appeal for restraint. Further escalatory actions risk devastating consequences," Jeanine Hennis-Plaschaert wrote in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

The envoy also acknowledged the efforts of medical teams "working under enormous stress to save lives and treat the wounded."

“Well, it Depends”: The Explosive Pagers Attack Revisited
=========================================================

On 17 September, 2024, thousands of pagers distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives in Lebanon and Syria exploded. While no State acknowledged responsibility for these explosions, [media reports](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html)
 have strongly suggested that Israel is responsible for them.

[_New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html)
 and [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/05/israel-mossad-hezbollah-pagers-nasrallah/)
 reporting suggests the following sequence of events. We note in this regard that between 8 October 2023 and 17 September 2024, [Hezbollah fired](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4893654-hezbollah-has-fired-more-than-8000-rockets-toward-israel-since-october-7-ambassador/)
 more than 8,000 rockets towards Israel, [reaching a peak](https://www.inss.org.il/publication/war-data/)
 of 1,300 rockets in the month of August alone. The fact that the Israeli major counter-attack was undertaken almost a year after Hezbollah’s attacks started, following a series of failed attempts to end Hezbollah’s use of force through resorting to more [measured military responses](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-hezbollah-targets-lebanon-military-says-2024-08-25/)
 and [diplomatic means](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2475451)
, appears to us to clearly meet the _jus ad bellum_ test of necessity.

In the same vein, the [argument](https://x.com/BCFinucane/status/1840416147360854526)
 that Israel was legally required to accept a ceasefire deal in Gaza—on terms which it considers [unacceptable](https://news.sky.com/story/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-rejects-ceasefire-deal-that-would-leave-hamas-intact-13129727)
 to it (i.e., which would leave Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip)—in order to stop Hezbollah’s rocket attacks, and that its failure to do so implies lack of military necessity, appears to us to be baseless. It has also been reported that the explosive charges installed in the pagers were relatively [small](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html)
, leading mostly to injuries and not deaths. In February 2024, Hezbollah decided to go “low tech” in order to evade Israel’s monitoring.

Anticipating this, Israel formed a shell corporation in Hungary called B.A.C. The actual explosion occurred shortly afterwards either by pager holders pressing two buttons manually with both of their hands to view the encrypted message or through a second activating message.

On 17 September, the detonation order was given and thousands of pagers exploded. Twelve persons were reportedly killed by the explosions (two of them children, most likely of Hezbollah operatives). On 18 September, a second set of explosions took place resulting in more casualties. This time the attacks were focused on walkie-talkies, which were probably in use by Hezbollah for a longer period of time (perhaps from as early as 2015).

While there appears to be broad appreciation among military experts of the sophistication of Israel’s intelligence services and the technical prowess they demonstrated in the pager attack, professional debates regarding the legality of the attack reveal deep disagreements (see e.g., [here](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/exploding-pagers-law/)
, [here](https://www.ejiltalk.org/were-the-israeli-pager-and-walkie-talkie-attacks-on-hezbollah-indiscriminate/)
 and [here](https://verfassungsblog.de/was-sagt-das-volkerrecht-zu-den-pager-und-walkie-talkie-explosionen/)
)."

These explosions resulted in deaths and injuries. The BBC article mentions that the attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister announced a "new phase in the war". The UN article mentions simultaneous explosions of pagers across the country.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, but it does not directly link the image of the exploded iPhone to those specific attacks. While there are reports of iPhones exploding, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable. `not enough information`

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo)) and UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486)) reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in deaths and injuries. The BBC article mentions that the attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister announced a "new phase in the war". The UN article mentions simultaneous explosions of pagers across the country.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible. The explosions resulted in casualties, with reports indicating the use of relatively small explosive charges. The article also mentions a second set of explosions on September 18, targeting walkie-talkies.
<image:10441>, <image:10443>, <image:10445>, <image:1>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence continues to show that iPhones can explode, but there is still no direct link between the image in the claim and the September 2024 attacks in Lebanon. The new images show different examples of exploded iPhones, but none of them are connected to the specific event described in the claim.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence connecting the image to the described event.

India Today reported on an iPhone XS Max exploding in a pocket, causing injuries (<image:10466>). Digit.in shows an image of an exploded iPhone (<image:10467>). iDrop News contains images of an exploded iPhone XS Max (<image:10468>).


## Elaboration
The evidence continues to show that iPhones can explode, but there is still no direct link between the image in the claim and the September 2024 attacks in Lebanon. The new images show different examples of exploded iPhones, but none of them are connected to the specific event described in the claim.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence connecting the image to the described event.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check confirms that explosions occurred in Lebanon in September 2024, and that iPhones can explode. However, there is no evidence to link the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or to confirm that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `not enough information`

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo)) and UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486)) reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in deaths and injuries. The BBC article mentions that the attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister announced a "new phase in the war". The UN article mentions simultaneous explosions of pagers across the country.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible. The explosions resulted in casualties, with reports indicating the use of relatively small explosive charges. The article also mentions a second set of explosions on September 18, targeting walkie-talkies.
<image:10441>, <image:10443>, <image:10445>, <image:1>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible. The explosions resulted in casualties, with reports indicating the use of relatively small explosive charges. The article also mentions a second set of explosions on September 18, targeting walkie-talkies.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

 in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped.

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing.

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

At least four people, including a child, were killed in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital on the outskirts of Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night.

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)

 and that Israel made similar allegations in Gaza before targeting medical facilities.

• Meanwhile, the UN warned [almost no aid is entering the Jabalya refugee camp](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlkf8w000h3b6ntv25t5iw)

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon hit branches of Hezbollah-linked bank

Strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strikes-beirut-idf-may-be-destroying-population-in-north-gaza-un-body-says)
    

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.

On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said.

Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group “uses this money to finance its terrorist activities”, including buying and storing arms.

The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited.

On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement.

Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon.

“The non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,” Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as encroaching on the country’s sovereignty.

Content: "Out of 135,000 tents, 110,000 are completely worn out and urgently need replacement,” it said.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said many tent sites are near the coast and are not designed to withstand “these horrific conditions”, especially as colder weather approaches.

“The rising tide has damaged many of these tents, leaving people with little hope and no dry clothes to protect themselves,” he said.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has warned that half a million people across the besieged enclave are at risk in areas hit by flooding.

“The situation will only get worse with every drop of rain, every bomb, every strike,” the agency said on X.

Meanwhile on Monday, Israeli attacks intensified across the enclave.

In Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, an Israeli air attack killed at least four people, medics said, while tanks deepened their incursions in Beit Hanoon, Beit Lahiya, and Jabalia – the largest of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps.

Medics said seven Palestinian people were also killed by two Israeli air attacks in Jabalia.

Residents in Gaza said Israeli planes also dropped new leaflets on Beit Lahiya ordering remaining residents to leave the northern city for the south, saying the area would come under attack and providing them with a map.

Palestinian people say Israel appears determined to depopulate the area permanently to create a buffer zone along the northern edge of Gaza. Our clothes got wet and we have nothing to protect ourselves, just the tent,” said Um Mohammad Marouf, a displaced Beit Lahiya resident.

Many [tents](/gallery/2024/11/25/heavy-rains-flood-tents-in-gaza-bringing-further-misery-to-palestinians)
 used in the early stages of Israel’s war in Gaza have now worn out and no longer offer protection. ![Gaza flood](/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-25T110219Z_849263743_RC2ACBA5QWAT_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1732533672.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Heavy rains have flooded tent encampments of displaced Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, adding misery to communities already devastated by 13 months of war, as Israeli forces stepped up attacks in the enclave.

Downpours overnight inundated tents and in some places [washed away](/gallery/2024/11/25/heavy-rains-flood-tents-in-gaza-bringing-further-misery-to-palestinians)
 the plastic and cloth shelters used by displaced people in the enclave, most of whom have been uprooted several times during the war between Israel and Hamas.

Some placed water buckets on the ground to protect mats from leaks and dug trenches to drain water away from their tents.

“We left the north and survived the bombings. I’ve been sick for three days,” Ahmad, a displaced resident of Jabalia, northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera in a tent camp in Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City.

“We were affected by the rain. The price of new tents and plastic sheeting has also shot up beyond the means of displaced families.

On Monday, Gaza’s Government Media Office said in a statement that about 10,000 tents were either washed away or damaged due to the storm, appealing for international help to provide displaced families with tents to shield them against the rain and cold.

“According to government field assessment teams, 81 percent of the displaced persons’ tents are no longer usable. Israel has repeatedly denied this accusation.

Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 44,235 Palestinians and wounded 104,638 since October 7, 2023.

An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day and more than 200 were taken captive.

Content: "Surely, even axiomatically, if there is any way we can survive inside the tank of a warming world and get out of it alive, it is by learning to fight – not to die – and to nourish some climate _sumud_ along these lines.

In Palestine, the real calamity would be consummated the day when there are no more muffled sounds detected from tunnels being dug under the border between Gaza and 1948, no more rockets groomed for a flight over it, no more stones smashing into settler cars, no more colony fences breached, no more tyres set alight and rolled towards wall towers, no more prisoners taken to emergency rooms after more than a month of hunger strike, no more marches to the orchards after Friday prayers, no more protesters tying themselves to olive trees, no more slingshots passed on between _shabab_ and _banat_ wrapped in _kouffiyehs_: and that day, thankfully, still looks very distant.

To those who – saturated with hypocritical moralism, an ethical smugness only the victors can afford – demand that we condemn the resistance, one should respond: what do you want the Palestinians to do?

The Walls of the Tank: On Palestinian Resistance
================================================

by [Andreas Malm](https://salvage.zone/author/andreasmalm/ "Posts by Andreas Malm")
 | May 1, 2017

! In what is probably the most famous scene in Palestinian fiction, they hide inside an empty water-tank and, while their smuggler is holed up at the border, succumb to the unbearable heat. When the smuggler finds their bodies, he cries out, in a scream echoing through generations of Palestinian resistance culture: ‘Why didn’t you knock on the sides of the tank? Why didn’t you bang the sides of the tank?’

Neither of these two canonical Palestinian writers, nor anyone else writing in Arabic, has come close to the global bestseller status of Susan Abulhawa. In _A Balcony over the Fakihani_, Liyana Badr describes one of these eternal recurrences, in Beirut in 1982, but her words could fit any of the others:

> I saw piles of concrete, stones, torn clothes scattered about, shattered glass, little pieces of cotton wool, fragments of metal, buildings destroyed or leaning crazily (…) White dust smothered the district, and through the gray of the smoke loomed the gutted shells of blocks and the debris of houses razed to the earth. Inside the tank is where they try to survive.

![](http://salvage.zone/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hammersickle_glyph.png)

If these descriptions of the fate of Palestine are the products of writers’ imagination, we now possess a sumptuous collection of photographs providing more hands-on evidence. Farmers crop wheat below the walls of Jerusalem, coppersmiths bang on lids, stone-cutters show their picks and axes, a merchant walks imperiously one step ahead of a man in ragged clothes carrying his burden on his back. One sweltering hot week in the summer of 2007, I stood with the great-grandchildren of that generation at the perimeters of the camp – by then a veritable city – and watched as the tanks of the Lebanese army reduced Nahr el-Bared to a pile of smouldering debris.

![](http://salvage.zone/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hammersickle_glyph.png)

What is the relationship between Palestine and the rest of the world? There remains to be written a history of the fossil economy in Palestine, from the first encounter with the power of steam in Akka, to the decline in precipitation, the drying-out, the rise of the sea, the salt-water intrusion, the storms.

![](http://salvage.zone/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hammersickle_glyph.png)

Palestine provides a human vantage point for seeing the truth about capitalist modernity known to most non-human life forms."

Content: "It appears that the victim was purposefully stripped of his clothes, as he was seen wearing only his underpants at the time of his death.

The ramming operation occurred before the Israeli army withdrew to the outskirts of the Zaytoun neighbourhood two days ago, as evidenced by the condition of the entrails and other body parts, which had not yet decomposed when the case was documented.

Another documented incident took place on 23 January, when an Israeli tank ran over members of the Ghannam family while they were sleeping in a shelter caravan in the Taiba Towers area of Khan Younis. A female civilian said that she was shocked by the tank suddenly running over her tent.

In addition, Euro-Med Monitor has documented numerous incidents of Israeli army tanks destroying civilian property, particularly cars, during Israel’s ground incursions into different parts of the Gaza Strip. Most of these tank attacks have targeted vehicles parked in the streets without any military affiliation, indicating the Israeli army’s deliberate and systematic destruction of Palestinian property.

Euro-Med Monitor affirmed that all of these violations are part of a larger Israeli effort to dehumanise every Palestinian in the Gaza Strip, in order to justifiy and normalise the crimes being committed against them. Crushing civilians with tanks is just one of the many cruel ways the Israeli army murders Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, disregarding their humanity, suffering, and dignity.

Palestinian territory- The Israeli army’s repeated killings of Palestinian civilians by deliberately running them over alive with military vehicles was vehemently denounced by Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Sunday, as was the widespread destruction of civilian property. These crimes are part of Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the rights group said, ongoing since 7 October 2023.

Euro-Med Monitor documented the Israeli army’s killing of a Palestinian man who was deliberately run over in Gaza City’s Al-Zaytoun neighbourhood on 29 February after he was arrested. To guarantee thorough and complete crushing, the victim was placed on asphalt rather than in an adjacent sandy area.

The victim’s mutilated body and the surrounding area bear obvious signs that a military bulldozer or tank was present. Amina, his 13-year-old daughter, confirmed that her father and older sister were killed when an Israeli tank unexpectedly and repeatedly ran over the caravan, where the family had been sleeping. While her mother and two other siblings survived the attack, Amina experienced extreme pressure in her eyes, nearly losing her sight.

Euro-Med Monitor also documented Israeli tanks and bulldozers running over and crushing displaced people inside their tents in Beit Lahia’s Kamal Adwan Hospital courtyard on 16 December 2023. These crimes come alongside a public incitement campaign by Israeli officials, media figures, and settlers calling for the annihilation of Palestinians in Gaza, and are also a result of the total impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators—evident by the absence of any meaningful action being taken to hold them accountable by any party or at any level.

The human rights organisation warned that the Israeli army has escalated its premeditated murders, extrajudicial executions, and judicial killings against Palestinian civilians since 7 October through direct targeting with snipers, drones, and running operations in various regions of the Gaza Strip."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

The ReliefWeb report details the Israeli army's actions in Gaza, including incidents of tanks running over Palestinian civilians between October 7, 2023, and February 29, 2024 ([https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar)).

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

Published On 18 Feb 202418 Feb 2024

**Rafah, Gaze Strip** – Running out of options and solutions, parents in Gaza have resorted to putting their children in the white medical coveralls that were part of COVID-19 PPE kits, in a desperate bid to keep them warm and dry.

Gaza’s displaced – many of them having been forced to move multiple times – are suffering in the severe winter cold with little to protect them from the elements other than thin tents at best.

For many of the 1.4 million people crammed into Rafah after fleeing other parts of Gaza, the only clothes they own are the ones they are wearing. The tanks haven’t stopped for a single moment.”

The tanks briefly seemed to have withdrawn from Maan at one point and Nour’s father tried to go to their house for more clothes.

“But the quadcopters shot at them and he was unable to reach the house. She was very sick and her temperature was high.

“I went out to look for this for her as well because there are many sizes and anyone can wear it.”

![Medical coveralls for warmth in Gaza](/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-08-at-6.10.04-PM-1707405187.jpeg?w=770&resize=770%2C514&quality=80)

Many children only have one set of clothes and, if they get wet, can take days to dry out. If these get wet, there is little chance of them drying again in the cold.

In some areas, teams are distributing white coveralls left over from the pandemic – they are plastic-lined and hold at least some of the damp at bay.

‘Like an astronaut’
-------------------

Nour al-Bayouk, 11, in his coveralls, explains that he, his parents and sisters came here from Maan to escape the bombing.

“We came here to the \[European\] hospital to stay in a tent. Now, they live in them – day and night.

“I’m warm and the water doesn’t get into my clothes,” says Nour. “I have no alternative clothes at all. If my clothes get wet I won’t find anything else to wear.

“At first I looked funny and scary. That’s why we found these suits as an opportunity to save us from the cold and the rain.”

![Medical coveralls for warmth in Gaza](/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-08-at-6.10.03-PM-1707405182.jpeg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

A child in medical coveralls in a bid to survive the severe cold in Gaza \[Ruwaida Amer/Al Jazeera\]

Raeda al-Khair, 35, who is originally from Gaza City in the north, managed to find space for her family in the European Hospital in Rafah in December. They had fled from Khan Younis, where they had been sheltering until the tanks rolled in at the start of December.

She says: “We came here with nothing. It’s a good idea for us as mothers because the children do not have alternative clothes and there is no place to wash or dry them.”

Life in the tents is becoming unbearable, she says."

1. Israel's intelligence minister Gila Gamliel has been speaking to BBC Radio 4.
    
    She was asked repeatedly about what specific intelligence Israel had for its claims that Hamas had a command centre under Gaza's largest hospital - Al Shifa.
    
    Gamliel did not give details, though she reiterated the Israel Defence Forces' assertion, [in a post on X in the past hour, external](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1724055160471564623)
    , that Hamas had attacked Israeli soldiers with an RPG from the entrance of al-Quds hospital.
    
    She said Hamas military facilities were located near and even under UN facilities, as well as mosques and schools. Hamas was making "extensive use" of hospitals, medical institutions and ambulances for military purposes, and using Gazans as human shields, she added.
    
    Asked about progress in negotiations on the release of more than 200 Israeli and foreign nationals being held hostage in Gaza, she said Israel did not differentiate between the abductees on the basis of their citizenship or other criteria. Marwan Al-Barsh who is the director-general of the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said there were, "more than a hundred corpses" piled up in the courtyard, with the situation exacerbated by a lack of fuel to power the mortuaries.
    
    "The electricity was cut off by the Israeli occupation forces that targeted the generators, which led to the decomposition and rotting of the corpses as we see worms coming out of them", Al-Barsh said on BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.
    
    Al-Bursh said they were struggling to bury their dead because of threats from the IDF.
    
    “We tried to co-ordinate with the occupation forces so that we would be allowed to bury the dead bodies inside the hospital, yet anyone who attempts to get out of the hospital is directly shot."
    
    Israel asserts that there is a Hamas command centre underneath Al-Shifa - IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss said: "We know that with certainty." Hamas and hospital authorities deny this.

7. As we reported earlier, Israel [also offered 300 litres of fuel to Al-Shifa hospital](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-middle-east-67400490?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=65522e2e2ea49e2bc009ae46%26IDF%20say%20Hamas%20to%20blame%20for%20no%20fuel%20at%20Al-Shifa%20hospital%262023-11-13T14%3A20%3A23.580Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:ddd42110-6b15-49ac-9481-021a3d42f7fc&pinned_post_asset_id=65522e2e2ea49e2bc009ae46&pinned_post_type=share)
    .
    
    Over a week ago, a US official [said UNRWA was able to access existing reserves in the territory](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-middle-east-67305304?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=65461a831ec331355f96164f%26US%20official%20says%20there%20is%20an%20agreed%20mechanism%20to%20bring%20more%20fuel%20into%20Gaza%262023-11-04T12%3A10%3A30.947Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:142b0677-9933-41aa-9937-e6c97dd522df&pinned_post_asset_id=65461a831ec331355f96164f&pinned_post_type=share)
    , and that there was an "agreed mechanism" for when this fuel ran out.
    
    According to Reuters, Lazzarini said the UN agency had been slowly emptying a fuel depot on the Gaza-Israel border and a request to the Israeli military to replenish it had gone unanswered.

8. A Palestinian woman has told the BBC that Israeli troops stormed the Al-Suwaidi (Swedish) Clinic in Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, and ordered 800 displaced people who had been sheltering there to leave.
    
    “They took the young men out, including my three sons and separated the women and children,” Maryam al-Arabeed, 65, said on Monday morning.
    
    “I saw an Israeli bulldozer completely demolish the Al-Suwaidi building.”
    
    Arabeed said she and six other women, as well as a number of children, walked away from the clinic and slept in the street after being told by the troops to go to Al-Shifa Hospital, which is about 1km (0.6 miles) to the south.
    
    The UN has warned that the situation is dire at Al-Shifa, with constant gunfire and bombings in the area. !Israeli soldiers seen operating in northern Gaza <image:10510>Image source, Reuters
    
    The Israeli army said on Monday that two more soldiers have died during fighting in northern Gaza.
    
    According to [the Israeli media, external](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-november-13-2023/?utm_source=article_hpsidebar&utm_medium=desktop_site&utm_campaign=liveblog-november-13-2023)
    , the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the beginning of the ground operation had risen to 44.

    On Sunday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Al-Quds hospital had run out of fuel and was no longer operational.
    
    On Monday, the PCRS said there was "heavy gunfire" and "bombardment" in the area and Israeli tanks and military were stationed near the hospital "from all directions". An Israeli power company says one of its workers was killed by anti-tank fire from Lebanon.
    
    On Sunday, the Israeli army said it launched air strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, after Hezbollah fired mortars and anti-tank missiles towards Israel, causing casualties.
    
    Rocket sirens frequently sound in northern Israeli towns on Lebanese border to warn civilians of incoming attacks.
    
    Hezbollah, whose rocket arsenal is widely believed to dwarf that of Hamas, has been carrying out relatively limited attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Al Jazeera article from November 25, 2024, discusses flooding in Gaza and its impact on displaced Palestinians ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks)). The ReliefWeb report details the Israeli army's actions in Gaza, including incidents of tanks running over Palestinian civilians between October 7, 2023, and February 29, 2024 ([https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar)).

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

CNN  — 

Guns swinging from their hips, two soldiers in black combat boots and green tactical clothing appear to wire explosives to pumps at the Canada Water reservoir in Rafah, southern Gaza.

Moments later, an orange blaze tears through the critical facility in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, as ribbons of grey smoke erupt into the sky.

The blast was captured in a [now deleted video](https://x.com/ytirawi/status/1816965332952555683)
, which was [reportedly](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/idf-canada-well-rachel-corrie-rafah-water)
 shared by an Israeli soldier on Instagram and geolocated by CNN. The IDF said the incident was under review by the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, “an independent investigative mechanism outside the chain of command entrusted with investigating exceptional events in warfare.”

There have been many water facilities damaged or destroyed by Israel’s 10-month-long assault in Gaza, according to the [UN](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-204-west-bank)
 and various other international bodies, compounding the civilian population’s suffering, risking the spread of disease and leading human rights experts to accuse Israel of using [water supply as a weapon](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/israel-using-water-as-weapon-of-war-as-gaza-supply-plummets-by-94-creating-deadly-health-catastrophe-oxfam/#:~:text=Halima%20Begum%2C%20Oxfam%20GB%20Chief,as%20a%20weapon%20of%20war.)
.

The destruction of the Canada Water reservoir “is certainly a breach of international humanitarian law (IHL),” Mark Zeitoun, director general of the Geneva Water Hub, a Swiss institute specializing in hydro-diplomacy, told CNN.

“IHL is meant to protect against indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population or the objects they depend upon (for) survival,” he said.

Even before the controlled explosion in late July, the Israeli siege drained fuel and electricity supplies needed to power the Canada Water reservoir and other water systems in the city, according to Rafah’s mayor, Ahmed Al-Sofi, causing severe shortages.

“Rafah was already suffering from water shortages,” Al-Sofi told CNN in July. The child was later paralyzed due to the disease, the UN [said](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1826899701003604318)
 on August 23.

World Health Organization (WHO) testing discovered the virus in [sewage samples](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-polio-detected-water-sewage-intl/index.html)
 in Gaza in July, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.

After the Gaza Ministry of Health declared a polio epidemic last month, the WHO [warned that](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/who-says-polio-vaccine-campaign-hurt-by-lack-gaza-ceasefire-2024-08-07/)
 ongoing Israeli bombardment had stifled vaccination efforts [in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-polio-detected-water-sewage-intl/index.html)
. They are now calling for a halt to the fighting to allow for an effective vaccination drive.

Widower Alaa Riyad says he treks many miles every day under the glare of the sun to collect water for his family, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.

The 42-year-old told CNN that he became “father and mother” to his children after his wife and 18 other relatives were killed by Israeli bombardment several months ago.

“We have found worms in the water more than once,” he told CNN. “What can we do?… There is no life for us.”

Israeli attacks in the strip have killed [more than 40,200 Palestinians](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-40000-israel-war-intl/index.html)
 and injured about 93,000 since the war started, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after the militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities.

‘Near complete destruction of all water infrastructure’
-------------------------------------------------------

Gaza’s water crisis has been building for decades. “The few functioning pumps that are still operating, the quality of the water is so bad… (But) people have no choice but to drink it.”

Within the first week of the war, Saaed Al-Madhoun, an emergency response manager for the humanitarian agency CARE International, was forced to flee an Israeli incursion with his family near their home in Gaza City, which was later flattened by bombardment.

The aid worker is haunted by “constant fear and uncertainty,” as the threat of Israeli attacks loom over his wife and five children, aged between 1 and 13 years old. Footage filmed by a journalist working for CNN shows residents tiptoeing through streams of muddy water pouring through the once-vibrant neighborhood.

The Israeli offensive has displaced up to 1.9 million people – nearly the entire population – in Gaza, according [to the UN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)

The Al Jazeera article from November 25, 2024, discusses flooding in Gaza and its impact on displaced Palestinians ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks)). The ReliefWeb report details the Israeli army's actions in Gaza, including incidents of tanks running over Palestinian civilians between October 7, 2023, and February 29, 2024 ([https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar)).

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Al Jazeera article from November 25, 2024, discusses flooding in Gaza and its impact on displaced Palestinians ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks)). The ReliefWeb report details the Israeli army's actions in Gaza, including incidents of tanks running over Palestinian civilians between October 7, 2023, and February 29, 2024 ([https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar)).

Content: The search result from Dreamstime shows a water tank with clothes drying in Sorong, Indonesia. <image:4253>


## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/4/12/weaponising-underwear-genocide-with-a-semi-pornographic-twist): 
Content: "A [recent Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-play-with-gaza-womens-underwear-online-posts-2024-03-28/)
 titled “Israeli soldiers play with Gaza women’s underwear in online posts” describes how combatants from the world’s self-appointed “most moral army” have been “posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the war in Gaza”.

In one video highlighted by Reuters, an Israeli soldier “sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa”.

Another visually “dissonant” episode features a solider perched on a tank, who proceeds to introduce his “beautiful wife”: a female mannequin sporting a helmet and black bra.

In response to the news agency’s inquiry, an Israeli military spokesperson “sent a statement saying the \[army\] investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values” of Israeli soldiers.

And yet it is pretty perverse in itself to even talk about “values” in the middle of a [genocide](/news/2024/3/26/un-expert-accuses-israel-of-several-acts-of-genocide-in-gaza)
 and Israeli-made [famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NCbfeEX3Ds)
 in the Gaza Strip.

Since October 7, Israel has [killed](/news/liveblog/2024/4/10/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-bombards-gaza-kills-14-in-nuseirat-camp?update=2828500)
 nearly 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, among them some 14,500 children and 9,500 women – numbers which are presumed to be grave underestimates. 8, 2023 \[AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg\]

Let’s pretend for a moment that, in the course of waging war against the state of Israel, Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip had taken to posing for social media posts with lingerie belonging to Israeli women who had been forced to flee their homes and/or killed in the war.

Imagine the moral outrage that would swiftly ensue, inevitably entailing racist and self-righteous allegations of Arab perverseness, the barbaric sexism of Islam, and the violent tendencies of sexually repressed Muslims.

The Fox Newses of the world would have had a field day.

As it turns out, a version of this hypothetical spectacle is true – except that it stars Israeli soldiers and Palestinian women’s lingerie. Children are [starving](/program/newsfeed/2024/3/27/videos-of-malnourished-children-show-gazas-forced-starvation-crisis)
 to death.

Rather than constituting an isolated blot on the morality of the Israeli armed forces, then, social media posts of Palestinian women’s underwear would seem to be aligned with general moral depravity and therefore entirely consistent with Israeli military “values”.

The United Nations Human Rights Office spokesperson has declared such posts to be “demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women”. Ultimately, the taunting display of Palestinian lingerie amounts to an almost pathetically cliched violation of the intimate space of Gazan women. In December, dozens of Palestinian men and boys sheltering at two Gaza schools were detained by the Israeli army, [stripped to their underwear](/news/2023/12/8/video-photos-appear-to-show-detainees-stripped-to-underwear-in-gaza)
, and made to kneel on the ground.

The degradation of Palestinian women is all the more obscenely hypocritical, however, in light of the Israeli military’s condemnation of Hamas for its “discrimination” against women in the territory it controls. A 2022 report by Israel’s State Comptroller, for example, found that approximately one-third of Israeli women performing mandatory military service had experienced sexual harassment the previous year.

The state of Israel has also weaponised the bikini-clad and otherwise half-naked bodies of its female fighting forces in order to effectively sexualise ethnic cleansing, as in the case of the 2007 Maxim magazine spread that tantalisingly wondered whether Israel’s female militants were not in fact “the world’s sexiest soldiers”.

As for the current lingerie tactic being deployed by social media-savvy troops in Gaza, the weaponisation of humiliation only compounds the suffering of Palestinian women – and men – who, forced to flee their homes, have already had their intimate space violated in every possible way.

And as the Israeli military simultaneously gets off playing with underwear and perpetrating genocide, it is a “dissonant visual record”, indeed.

An Israeli soldier stands in an apartment during a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Nov. But to be playing around with the panties of people you are killing takes depravity to another level.

Call it Orientalist fetishization with a genocidal twist.

Granted, it’s not just the females of Gaza who are eligible for such “demeaning” treatment; Gazan males can be intimately humiliated, too. A section on the military’s English-language website devoted to “The Status of Women in Gaza” laments that “basic rights are often systematically denied” to females, who are faced with “decreased educational opportunities” as well as “limited employment opportunities” – a situation that is clearly best rectified by Israel’s bombing of [most such opportunities](/news/2023/12/20/gaza-essential-uninhabitable-as-infrastructure-damage-kills-job-market)
 to smithereens.

The website reports that “violence against women continues at alarming rates” in the Gaza Strip. More than 76,000 people have been wounded as homes, hospitals, [schools](/news/2024/1/24/how-israel-has-destroyed-gazas-schools-and-universities)
 and everything else that is bombable have been bombed."

March 28 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 as a looming [famine](/world/middle-east/destruction-lawlessness-red-tape-hobble-aid-gazans-go-hungry-2024-03-25/)

Elsewhere, another soldier sits atop a tank holding a female mannequin dressed in a black bra and helmet and says: "I found a beautiful wife, serious relationship in Gaza, great woman."

The two videos shot by Israeli soldiers are among dozens of posts in which troops in Gaza are shown displaying lingerie, mannequins, and in some cases both. Instagram did not comment.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza was launched in response to an attack on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Oct. By contrast, he said, posts showing weapons or Hamas flags said to have been found in Gazan homes have been circulating widely.

Approached about images he reposted to his more than 100,000 followers on X between Feb. Reuters then independently verified eight posted on Instagram or YouTube.

"The posting of such images is demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women," said Ravina Shamdasani, U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson.

Reuters sent details of the eight verified posts on YouTube or Instagram to the Israel Defense Forces, requesting comment.

In response, a spokesperson sent a statement saying the IDF investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values of IDF soldiers, as well as reports of videos uploaded to social networks.

"In cases where suspicion of a criminal offense arises that justifies opening an investigation, an investigation is opened by the Military Police," it said.

"It should be clarified that in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the video is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly," the statement said.

The IDF declined to say whether it was referring to any of the images highlighted by Reuters, or whether any of the soldiers responsible have been disciplined.

The Israeli soldiers whom Reuters was able to identify did not respond to requests for comment sent via their social media accounts.

The ReliefWeb report details the Israeli army's actions in Gaza, including incidents of tanks running over Palestinian civilians between October 7, 2023, and February 29, 2024 ([https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar)).

Claim: "<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:36>)
web_search("tank drying clothes Gaza")
image_search("tank drying clothes")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Al Jazeera article from November 25, 2024, discusses flooding in Gaza and its impact on displaced Palestinians ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/flooding-in-gaza-compounds-hardship-of-people-displaced-by-israeli-attacks)). The ReliefWeb report details the Israeli army's actions in Gaza, including incidents of tanks running over Palestinian civilians between October 7, 2023, and February 29, 2024 ([https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israeli-tanks-have-deliberately-run-over-dozens-palestinian-civilians-alive-enar)).

The article "The Walls of the Tank: On Palestinian Resistance" by Andreas Malm, published on May 1, 2017, discusses Palestinian resistance and includes a photograph of a tank ([https://salvage.zone/the-walls-of-the-tank-on-palestinian-resistance/](https://salvage.zone/the-walls-of-the-tank-on-palestinian-resistance/)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856): 
Content: The search result from Dreamstime shows a water tank with clothes drying in Sorong, Indonesia. <image:4253>


## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

The BBC News, NBC News, and The Economist articles all feature images of Israeli tanks. The BBC News article is from May 2024 and shows an Israeli tank in Gaza. (<image:10520>, <image:10521>, <image:10522>)


## Elaboration

The claim states the image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. While the evidence confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza, it does not confirm the image's date or the context of the image.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and context of the image.

## Elaboration
The evidence shows Palestinian women drying clothes in Gaza. However, there is no evidence of a Palestinian woman drying clothes on an Israeli tank. The claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because there is no evidence of a Palestinian woman drying clothes on an Israeli tank. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unverified. While the evidence confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza and shows Palestinian women drying clothes in Gaza, there is no evidence to support the specific scenario of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes.

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 4, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

An Israeli source told Channel 12 news Wednesday that “a mechanism will be established, similar to the one built between Israel and Russia.” The two countries [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country and Russia provided military support for the Bashar regime in ending the country’s civil war.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told CNN Turk Wednesday that Turkey and Israel had been holding talks on the matter “when needed.”

“While we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia,” Fidan said.

### Airbase strikes

On Saturday, Reuters reported that Turkey [scoped out at least three airbases](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 in Syria where it could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact that could see new Turkish bases in central Syria and the use of Syria’s airspace, before Israel hit the sites. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

### International mediation

Both Azerbaijan and the US have offered to mediate between the two countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has referenced his country’s past role in facilitating Israeli-Turkish ties and said this week that “both countries are close friends of Azerbaijan.”

“I think, despite the legitimate concerns and the quite high level of mistrust, there can still be found grounds for normalization and areas of mutual interest,” he said at the annual ADA University Policy Forum in Baku.

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter. Its final calculus will likely be shaped by Washington's position, but regardless, given its demonstrated military superiority in recent months, Israel will want to play a key role in shaping Syria’s future.

‘Everything would be fine if It weren’t for the Palestinian question’

Turkey: wanting to have it both ways on Israel
==============================================

Though longstanding allies, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has grown increasingly critical of Israel’s actions towards the Palestinians, but without renouncing Ankara’s broader strategic interests.

There was a message from Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech posted on X on 30 March on the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr prayer marking the end of Ramadan: ‘We see and we know what’s happening in Palestine. Turkey’s economic success – that year it ranked 17th in the world in terms of GDP and achieved a 6% growth rate ([1](/2025/05/02turkey#nb1 "According to the International Monetary Fund.")
) – boosted its prestige in the Arab world, as did its ability to combine Islam and democracy.

So when the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Ankara sought to take advantage of that prestige to reshape the Middle East through an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had come to power in Egypt and seemed likely to do the same in Syria, or so Turkey hoped. If Ankara requested a no-fly zone in the north of Syria or took charge of the air space, it would be seen as a casus belli by the Israeli prime minister, who intends to maintain freedom to carry out airstrikes there and in Iran Player in current talks on Syria

Between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, Turkey was becoming a key site for Mossad as it looked to recruit. The Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 therefore came just as Turkey was preparing to normalise relations with Israel.

Erdoğan did not condemn the attack and rejected the use of the term ‘terrorist’, describing Hamas as a ‘group of freedom \[fighters\] who are striving to protect their lands’ ([2](/2025/05/02turkey#nb2 "Gabriel Gavin, ‘Mediator no more: Erdoğan takes aim at Israel, backing Hamas (…)")
). As activists who denounce government’s ‘hypocrisy’ acknowledge, ‘he’s doing our work for us.’ A significant part of Turkish public opinion – 45% view Hamas favourably ([3](/2025/05/02turkey#nb3 "Lena Argiri, ‘Greece makes strides in global fight against antisemitism, (…)")
) – is calling for an end to trade ties with Israel.

By demanding sanctions against Tel Aviv at the same time as the closing of an American radar station at Kürecik used by the Israelis and even for Turkish troops to be sent to Gaza, the New Welfare Party (YRP) led by Fatih Erbakan (the son of Erdoğan’s former mentor) is gaining a growing following – including within AKP ranks. Basically,’ explains Henri Barkey, emeritus professor of international relations at Lehigh University (Pennsylvania), ‘Israel and Turkey find themselves in similar situations in Syria. And political scientist Halil Karaveli believes an independent Rojava – a currently autonomous Kurdish enclave in the northeast of Syria – is all the more of a headache for Turkey given that it could ‘provide Israel with a strategic ally at the crossroads of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Levant’. That is something which would conclusively render null and void the Turkish diplomats’ maxim, ‘Everything would be fine with Israel were it not for the Palestinian question.’

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Syria’s interim government has requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat “terrorist organizations,” including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria’s defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

“As long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,” Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

“The heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey’s national security,” he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria’s interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey’s national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be “following” the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria’s national army."

In DepthSince the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Israel has exploited the weakness of the new Syrian government to carry out cross-border operations in the name of its security, while Recep Tayyip Erdogan seeks to assert his influence in the region.

At the forefront of the border triangle between Syria, Jordan and Israel, the Syrian village of Kuwaya offers a panoramic view of the fertile lands irrigated by the Yarmouk River flowing below. Up there is the Syrian village of Maaraba and, recently, a new position of the Israeli army: "From this hill, Israel controls the whole region," he said worryingly.

On the morning of March 25, an Israeli army patrol ventured for the first time beyond the [demilitarized buffer zone](https://www.un.org/geospatial/content/undof-deployment-march-2024 "Nouvelle fenêtre")

The new evidence confirms that in March 2025, tensions between Israel and Syria escalated, with Israeli actions leading to clashes ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/04/26/in-syria-israel-and-turkey-maneuver-for-power_6740655_4.html)). Furthermore, on March 30, 2025, Turkish President Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). While this indicates strong disapproval of Israel's actions, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey urged the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial search revealed that while there were discussions and meetings between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan in March 2025, there was no direct evidence of Turkey urging the U.S. to control Israel. The subsequent search confirmed escalating tensions between Israel and Syria in March 2025 and Erdogan's strong condemnation of Israel, but still did not provide evidence of Turkey urging the U.S. to intervene.

[Careful footwork: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a joint press conference for Israeli President Isaac Herzog's state visit to Ankara, Turkey, on March 9, 2022. This could intensify competition across overlapping spheres of influence – from Syria and Iraq to the Eastern Mediterranean and the South Caucasus.

The characterisation of Turkey as the principal beneficiary of the recent Iran-Israel conflict – emerging unscathed while its two regional rivals engaged in direct confrontation – oversimplifies the pressures facing Ankara’s foreign and security policy. Once close allies now appear to be on a collision course – but it is crucial to discern what is real, what is calibrated for domestic audiences, and how much of the current tension may ultimately prove impermanent.

The Current State of Bilateral Relations
----------------------------------------

Despite efforts to rehabilitate ties between Turkey and Israel following President Isaac Herzog’s [historic state visit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/middleeast/israel-isaac-herzog-turkey-visit.html)
 to Ankara in March 2022, relations nosedived as Israel’s military action in Gaza intensified following the horrific Hamas attacks on 7th October 2023, triggering a rising civilian death toll rose and a humanitarian catastrophe there.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the [harshest critics](https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-compare-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-adolf-hitler-unga/)
 of the current Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Domestically, Israeli military unilateralism is already emboldening Turkey’s own assertive defence posture, fuelling efforts to strengthen its indigenous military capabilities.

While Israel and Turkey diverge sharply in their visions for the region’s future security architecture, they share some objectives: limit the possibility of Iranian re-entrenchment in the region, particularly across Syria; and the refusal to tolerate hostile actors on their borders.

The Regional Alliance-Building Race
-----------------------------------

For Israel and Iran, the current pause seems to be an opportunity to reframe their post-war narratives and shore up regional allies as a form of strategic deterrence. Such complexity is testament to blurred lines, overlapping trade interests, and transactional diplomacy, a not so hidden receding of previous ‘us or them’ binaries.

The Kurdish Question in Turkey-Israel Ties
------------------------------------------

If tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate to military standoff, it will most likely spark in Syria. [Israel sees](https://www.inss.org.il/social_media/between-the-united-states-turkey-and-israel-insights-from-the-announcement-on-reducing-us-forces-in-syria/)
 diminished American troop presence in Syria as a win for Turkey, and a setback for Israel.

Israel’s support for the Kurds, a group seen as less hostile to Israel, has amplified since the overthrow of the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Rather than direct confrontation, a more imminent risk relates to a sub-threshold conflict or ‘grey zone’ activity between Turkey and Israel.

While the prospect of formal normalisation between Israel and either Lebanon or Syria remains highly improbable, the establishment of a functional non-aggression mechanism – particularly from the perspective of Damascus – could be transformative. This will inevitably call for a recalibration of the strategic triangle between Turkey, Israel, and Iran.

ANKARA, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Turkey will provide weapons systems and logistical tools to Syria under a military cooperation accord signed on Wednesday, a Turkish Defence Ministry source said, adding that Ankara would also train the Syrian army in using such equipment if needed.

Turkey, a NATO member, has been one of Syria's [main foreign allies](/world/middle-east/turkish-foreign-minister-damascus-talks-with-syrias-sharaa-source-says-2025-08-07/)
 since the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad last year. It has vowed to help train and restructure Syria's armed forces, rebuild the country and its institutions, and support efforts to protect Syrian territorial integrity.

 between their foreign and defence ministers, and intelligence chiefs.

"The memorandum aims to coordinate, plan military training and cooperation, provide consultancy, information and experience sharing, ensure the procurement of military equipment, weapon systems, logistical materials and related services," the Turkish Defence Ministry source told reporters on Thursday.

Last month an official at the Turkish Defence Ministry told Reuters the Syrian army was in need of restructuring after years of conflict, citing shortcomings in discipline, training, organisation, and modernisation.

Ankara has warned of military action against the SDF, which it considers a terrorist organisation and has targeted in past cross-border operations. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

(March 28, 2025 / JNS)

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, is not a likable person. The severe blows Israel inflicted upon Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria provided the jihadists led by Ahmed al-Sharaa (the nom de guerre for Mohammad al-Julani), a path to victory over Assad’s forces.

According to an article published in the _Türkiye_ newspaper on March 17, “[Turkey will train](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/03/742137/Turkey-military-bases-Syria)
 the country’s army in two military bases it will establish in Syria.” The paper also reported that “Turkey and Syria will sign a joint defense agreement. The commission also declared that “Religious minorities in Turkey have expressed concerns that governmental rhetoric and policies contribute to an increasingly hostile environment and [implicitly encourage](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256675/how-difficult-is-it-to-be-a-christian-in-turkey-what-you-need-to-know)
 acts of societal aggression and violence.”

With his incompetent handling of the Turkish economy and his avoidance of the difficult tasks required to heal it, Erdoğan seeks “victories” in foreign affairs, including his meddling in Jerusalem’s management of Islamic holy sites. 

In September, for instance, Erdoğan accused Israel of targeting the Al-Aqsa Mosque as part of an expansionist Israeli drive. He also urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to convene an emergency summit to discuss the war in Gaza and accused Israel of attacks on Muslims in Jerusalem.  

The Trump administration must reconsider providing F-16 jet fighters to Turkey, as well its place in NATO. The United States must also protect the Kurds of northeastern Syria from repeated attacks by the Turkish armed forces. 

Under Erdoğan, Turkey is fighting the [Syrian Democratic Forces](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syria-sharaa-assad-damascus-aleppo-killed-violence-tartus-kurd-latakia-rcna195580)

Turkey’s moves in Syria threaten Israel  
=========================================

It is time for the United States to address the excesses of Turkey’s president.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends a meeting at Vahdettin Palace in Istanbul on Jan. We must only be strong.”

Turkey’s president has escalated his attacks on Israel since the Oct. He has sought to incite the Sunni-Muslim world against Israel, and according to many in Israel, Erdoğan’s hostility toward Israel has reached a point where many in the Jewish state see a Sunni-Muslim crescent led by Erdoğan just as threatening as the Shiite-Muslim crescent led by Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei.

A Turkish military presence on Syrian territory could present a real threat to the State of Israel. 

The Trump administration must consider measures against the megalomaniacal Turkish leader, who is unreliable insofar as NATO is concerned. Erdoğan purchased Russian S-400 missiles designed to shoot down NATO planes, and Russia provided the Turkish armed forces with advanced weapons capable of covering most of Syria, as well as their old adversary, Greece (also a NATO member), in contravention of NATO rules.

Under Erdoğan, religious minorities in Turkey are also faring badly, according to the U.S. Photo by Rory Arnold/No10 Downing Street via Wikimedia Commons.](https://me.jnsi.org/uploads/2025/03/erdogan-1320x880.jpg "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends a meeting at Vahdettin Palace in Istanbul on Jan. Certainly not outside of Turkey, but also among a great many inside the country. Considered by many a megalomaniac who views himself as the caliph of the Sunni-Muslim world, he seeks to recreate the Ottoman Empire.

Some, like the jihadists who took over Syria with Erdoğan’s equipment, training and cash, look up to him. According to the agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, Ankara will help Syria if Damascus faces a sudden threat.”

_Türkiye_ also reported the government’s plan to have 50 Turkish Air Force F-16 jetfighters nest inside the new bases to support and protect the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from collapse until a new Syrian air force is established.

Erdoğan has far greater ambitions than simply training Syrian Sunni rebels.

The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported on a large-scale military mobilization by Turkish forces, along with an extensive deployment of mine engineering teams, in the villages of Mar’anaz, Al-Alqamiyah and Menagh in northern Syria.

Should Erdoğan deploy the F-16 jet fighters in Syria, it would threaten Israeli security and hinder Israeli preventive operations inside Syria.

Israel has established a temporary buffer zone on the Syrian slopes of Mount Hermon to protect its citizens in the Golan Heights from jihadist forces."

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)
, killed last Friday in an airstrike in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/01/nx-s1-5059999/hamas-militant-leader-announced-dead-by-israel-military)
, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Indonesia': 0.23, 'Malaysia': 0.15, 'Sri Lanka': 0.15, 'Bangladesh': 0.13, 'Cambodia': 0.06, 'Philippines': 0.05, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Uganda': 0.03, 'India': 0.02, 'Nigeria': 0.02}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel on October 1, 2024, including a major Iranian missile attack on Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, and the assassination of leaders. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats (ISW) also published an update on the same day, detailing the Iranian ballistic missile attack, Hezbollah's attacks, and IDF ground operations in Lebanon ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)).

The ISW update also mentions attacks by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthi attacks on Israel, and includes a map of Houthi attacks (<image:2136>). The NPR article includes images of military vehicles (<image:2128>) and a destroyed building with a picture of a leader (<image:2130>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:46>)
web_search("Iranian strikes against Israel October 1 2024")
image_search("fire tents Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Indonesia': 0.23, 'Malaysia': 0.15, 'Sri Lanka': 0.15, 'Bangladesh': 0.13, 'Cambodia': 0.06, 'Philippines': 0.05, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Uganda': 0.03, 'India': 0.02, 'Nigeria': 0.02}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel on October 1, 2024, including a major Iranian missile attack on Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, and the assassination of leaders. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats (ISW) also published an update on the same day, detailing the Iranian ballistic missile attack, Hezbollah's attacks, and IDF ground operations in Lebanon ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)).

The ISW update also mentions attacks by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthi attacks on Israel, and includes a map of Houthi attacks (<image:2136>). The NPR article includes images of military vehicles (<image:2128>) and a destroyed building with a picture of a leader (<image:2130>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 14, 2024, showing an image of tents on fire (<image:10563>). NBC News published an image of a fire (<image:10564>). The Hindu published an article about an Israeli strike on a hospital tent camp in Gaza (<image:10565>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/burned-and-charred-bodies-as-israel-hits-tents-at-central-gaza-hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/burned-and-charred-bodies-as-israel-hits-tents-at-central-gaza-hospital), [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877), and [https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-in-gaza-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/article68751478.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-in-gaza-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/article68751478.ece).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.

An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Published On 21 Sep 202421 Sep 2024

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 and other [communications devices](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-second-wave-tech-pager-explosions-beirut-nabatieh-tyre-saida/)
 used by Hezbollah members killed dozens of people and injured thousands more."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched an attack on Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. The image search results show images of fire and blasts at the airbase. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely false. The image may depict a different event or be digitally altered. Further investigation is needed to confirm the image's authenticity and origin.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")

 The names of the 184 victims of the Pentagon attack are inscribed on the memorial's side.

10th anniversary memorial services

\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services

 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

**READ MORE:** [Israeli strikes across Gaza hit multiple homes, killing at least 85 Palestinians](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-hit-multiple-homes-killing-at-least-85-palestinians)

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

 [airstrikes](https://www.newarab.com/news/huge-blasts-gaza-suggests-israel-using-suicide-apcs)
 on the Sabra neighbourhood in Gaza City.

Emergency workers spent hours digging through the debris after the strikes flattened residential buildings, leaving civilians buried under concrete, wood, and metal. According to local reports, civil defence teams also rescued a mother and three of her children from the same area.

Mohamad Safa, a Lebanese diplomat and UN representative, wrote on X: "The baby who remained under the rubble all night in Gaza has made it safely. Share positivity."

The widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and renewed attention on the toll it has taken on children.

"The picture says it all: an attempt to rescue a baby from beneath the rubble of his home. Most hospitals and medical facilities across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.

The latest developments come as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reported this week that more than 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded since October 2023.

UNRWA also noted that humanitarian workers, medical personnel, and journalists continue to be killed in the course of Israel's military operations.

Earlier this year, records showed that over 38,000 Palestinian children have been orphaned and at least 13,901 women widowed since the start of Israel’s assault.

_Al Jazeera_ journalist [Anas al-Sharif](https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-journalist-removes-protective-gear-after-truce-announcement)
 commented on the rescue: "This is the reality for children in Gaza. Others called the scenes an "unfathomable injustice".

Gaza's civil defence teams and the Palestinian Ministry of Health have repeatedly warned that Israel’s ongoing blockade and bombardment have crippled emergency response capabilities. If they survive the bombs, they are often left wounded, traumatised, or buried beneath the rubble of their homes. They grow up not with toys, but with the sounds of drones and airstrikes."

The baby, whose name has not yet been released, was one of several civilians pulled from the wreckage. What did the children do to deserve living through and feeling the pain and bitterness of war?" one user [wrote on X](https://x.com/SolimanHijjy/status/1929825392375874029)

Five-year-old Ward Khalil survived an Israeli air attack early on Monday that killed her mother, two of her siblings and 33 other people \[Al Jazeera\]

Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a 36-year-old paediatrician and mother of 10, spent the morning of Friday, May 23, doing what she had devoted her life to: Saving children at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital. Two remain buried beneath the rubble, including her youngest, six-month-old Sayden, still asleep in his crib when Dr al-Najjar kissed him goodbye that morning.

In just one Israeli air strike – in just one minute – her entire world was annihilated.

Her husband Hamdy, 40, also a doctor, and their son Adam, 11, are in the ICU, their lives hanging by a thread inside Gaza’s disintegrating health system – not by chance but by design. She was one of 18,000 Palestinian children killed since October, one of 1,300+ since Israel broke the ceasefire in March, and one of dozens in just 48 hours.

Commenting on the moral double standards applied to Palestinians, Dan Sheehan, editor at Literary Hub, noted: “If an 11-year-old Israeli influencer – a girl who delivered food and toys to displaced children – had been killed, the Empire State Building would be lit up for her. Video footage showed Danny Danon – his Israeli counterpart – stifling a yawn in response.

In the face of the death of Palestinian children, Israel yawns in indifference. This is unsurprising, with a recent poll showing that 82 percent of Jewish Israelis support expelling Palestinians from Gaza. How can Palestinians be told, then, to bring themselves – and their children – to Israeli military aid delivery stations and expect safety, not savagery? Will the number of 18,000 Palestinian children – whose names we may never fully know – not be enough?

In December 2023, UNICEF, the UN’s children’s agency, declared: “The Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.” On May 27, the organisation stated that “Since the end of the ceasefire on 18 March, 1,309 children have reportedly been killed and 3,738 injured. But, in Gaza, girls running from fire, pulled from the rubble and burned beyond recognition are not enough to provoke action.

In Gaza, when children are caught in the fire of relentless bombing, the world turns its back. In tears, Dr Alaa begged rescuers to let her hold her daughter one last time.

Sadly, the white shrouds wrapped around the bodies of Gaza’s children continue to mount.

Yaqeen Hammad is now one of those shrouded and buried children.

Just 11 years old, Yaqeen was one of Gaza’s youngest social media influencers. In one of her videos, while preparing food, she told the world: “In Gaza, we don’t know the word impossible.” This was her crime.

On May 23, the same day Alaa’s children were incinerated, Israel decided that Yaqeen was somehow a threat to its existence."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

Content: "Residents had to open a hole in the wall to evacuate the dead and wounded**,” UNRWA told _UN News_.

Since the start of the war between Hamas and Israel on 7 October 2023, **more than 400 schools have received a direct hit**, according to satellite imagery analyzed by the UN.

**Deadly aftermath**
--------------------

Footage from the scene provided by the UN agency showed walls and floors blown out in the main school building.

In the courtyard, hundreds of people could be seen standing amid crumpled metal sheeting on the morning after the attack, with rubble and wooden planks strewn around where their shelters had been standing just hours earlier.

“Our colleagues are reporting that surviving parents and children are trying to salvage their belongings among the blood and body parts of their relatives and neighbours,” UNRWA said.

The agency noted that fatalities included women and children, while search and rescue operations are ongoing for several people still missing.

Many of those living at the school when it was hit have been displaced “countless times” by the war, which began on 7 October 2023, following Hamas-led terror attacks on Israel, UNRWA stressed.

The attack also sparked a fire in an adjacent school where more tents and temporary shelters were burned and damaged.

Education destroyed
-------------------

[According to the UN Satellite Service, UNOSAT](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/verification-damages-schools-based-proximity-damaged-sites-gaza-occupied-palestinian-territory-update-9-may-2025)
, 95.4 per cent of schools in Gaza have sustained damage since the start of the war.

**Of the enclave’s 564 schools, 501 will either need full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again**.

“There is no humanity left in Gaza, and no humanity left as the world continues to watch day after day as families are bombed, burned alive and starved,” UNRWA said after the latest attack.

**Failed strategy won’t work: Türk**
------------------------------------

In a related development, the [UN human rights chief](https://www.ohchr.org/en/about-us/high-commissioner)
 Volker Türk [on Wednesday condemned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/turk-israeli-plans-expand-gaza-offensive-aggravate-concerns-regarding)
 Israel’s reported plans to forcibly transfer Gaza’s population to a small area in the south of the Strip.

**The move fuels concern that Israel’s intention is to make life for Palestinians “increasingly incompatible with their continued existence in Gaza”**, he said in a statement.

> 'Surviving parents and children are trying to salvage their belongings among the blood and body parts of their relatives and neighbours' - UNRWA

“There is no reason to believe that doubling down on military strategies, which, for a year and eight months, have not led to a durable resolution, including the release of all hostages, will now succeed,” insisted the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Expanding the offensive on Gaza “will almost certainly cause further mass displacement, more deaths and injuries of innocent civilians, and the destruction of Gaza’s little remaining infrastructure”, he continued.

**Rights experts warn of irreversible consequences**
----------------------------------------------------

Escalating atrocities in Gaza mark a critical moral turning point and demand urgent international action, UN-appointed independent human rights experts said [in a statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/end-unfolding-genocide-or-watch-it-end-life-gaza-un-experts-say-states-face)

**Occupied West Bank update**
-----------------------------

In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, UN aid teams warned of worsening conditions for Palestinian communities **because of “violence by Israeli forces and settlers”**.

The alert comes after Israeli forces on Monday demolished more than 30 structures in Khallet Athaba, a hamlet in Hebron governorate, displacing nearly a dozen families – or around 50 people.

“This constitutes most of the structures in the community and marks the third and largest demolition there since February,” said UN aid coordination office, [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/)

New horror in Gaza as double strike on school shelter kills 30
==============================================================

**By** **Daniel Johnson**

7 May 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Grim details emerged on Wednesday of Israeli airstrikes on a UN-run school in Gaza sheltering 2,000 displaced people, which reportedly killed 30 Palestinians sheltering there.

The UN agency for Palestine refugees, [UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
, maintained that Israeli forces hit the school in Al Bureij, Middle Gaza, at around 6pm on Tuesday and again at 10.20pm.

“**The school sustained severe damage and a fire broke out in the shelter, making it difficult to evacuate the casualties. – Israel continues its relentless destruction of life in Gaza**,” they warned, citing attacks by land, air and sea, and a soaring civilian death toll.

“No one is spared – not children, persons with disabilities, nursing mothers, journalists, health professionals, aid workers, or hostages,” they said, noting that on 18 March alone, 600 Palestinians were reportedly killed, 400 of them children. They are among more than 100 buildings slated for demolition, following an Israeli notice issued at the start of the month.

**Forcible transfer fears**
---------------------------

OCHA described how dozens of families in the camp were given little time on Monday to collect their belongings before their homes were demolished.

The agency highlighted the “strong push” to uproot Palestinians living in the area “**once again raising concerns about the risks of forcible transfer of the population**”.

Under international law, Israel as the occupying power, has the responsibility to protect Palestinians in the West Bank and ensure their safety and dignity, OCHA insisted.

Humanitarian partners are mobilizing assistance, but urgent international engagement is needed to stop these coercive measures and protect vulnerable communities, the UN aid office said.

The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

Nine of a doctor’s 10 children are killed in latest Israeli strikes in Gaza, health officials say
=================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 May 24, 2025 6:47 PM EDT

CAIRO (AP) — The bodies of 79 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Saturday, a toll that doesn’t include hospitals in the battered north that it said are now inaccessible.

Nine of a doctor’s 10 children were among those killed in Israel’s renewed military offensive, colleagues and the Health Ministry said.

Alaa Najjar, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital, was on duty at the time and ran home to find her family’s house on fire, Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital’s pediatric department, told The Associated Press.

Najjar’s husband was severely wounded and their only surviving child, an 11-year-old son, was in critical condition after Friday’s strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, Farra said.

The dead children ranged in age from 7 months to 12 years old. Khalil Al-Dokran, a spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, told the AP that two of the children remained under the rubble.

Israel’s military in a statement said it struck suspects operating from a structure next to its forces, and described the area of Khan Younis as a “dangerous war zone.” It said it had evacuated civilians from the area, and “the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”

Earlier on Saturday, a statement said Israel’s air force struck over 100 targets throughout Gaza over the past day.

The Health Ministry said the new deaths brought the war’s toll to 53,901 since the Oct. and aid groups deny there is significant diversion.

Hospitals in Gaza are again reporting attacks and other Israeli pressure.

The Health Ministry said 11 security personnel have been trapped at the European Hospital in southern Gaza following heavy gunfire and airstrikes since at least Tuesday. This week, the [first aid trucks entered](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/netanyahu-says-hell-allow-some-aid-into-gaza-after-pressure-from-allies)
 the territory and began reaching Palestinians since the blockade began.

COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid for Gaza, said 388 trucks had entered since Monday. Hams said the security staff stayed behind to protect from looting, and that it was the only hospital in Gaza offering neurosurgery, cardiac care and cancer treatment.

Israel said it will continue to strike Gaza until Hamas releases all of the 58 remaining Israeli hostages and disarms. Netanyahu has rejected those terms and has vowed to maintain control over Gaza and facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its Palestinian population.

“The Israeli government and its leader have a clear choice: deal or war, saving lives or abandonment,” Liran Berman, brother of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman, told a weekly rally in Tel Aviv as families and supporters again demanded an agreement that would bring everyone home.

 [Samy Magdy, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/samy-magdy-associated-press) The ministry said 3,747 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed the war on March 18 in an effort to pressure Hamas to accept different ceasefire terms. Its count doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Israel’s pressure on Hamas has included a blockade of Gaza and its over 2 million people since early March. Saleh Hams, director of the nursing department, said patients were evacuated after an Israeli strike on May 13. 7 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others.

Hamas has said it will only return the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from the territory."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image likely depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike, as indicated by the geolocate tool and web searches. However, the exact date of the image, July 2024, cannot be verified with the available evidence. Therefore, the claim is missing information about the date. `not enough information`

([https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza](https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza)) <image:10688> VPM.org published an article on October 7, 2024, with photos from the year since October 7, including an image of children near rubble. ([https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2024-10-07/photos-a-look-back-at-the-year-since-oct-7](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2024-10-07/photos-a-look-back-at-the-year-since-oct-7)) <image:10689>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, with a high probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel. The web searches and image searches provide additional context, showing that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes, and many have been killed or wounded. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.

### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News reported on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother. The war began on October 7, 2023. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents))

The New Arab published an article on June 3, 2025, about a baby rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. The article mentions that widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The article also mentions that more than 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded since October 2023. <image:59>

### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published a video about rescue workers fighting to save children trapped in Gaza City airstrike rubble. (<image:10680>) Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the Israeli war on Gaza's children, which includes an image of children near rubble. (<image:10681>)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a [collapsed apartment](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-20-2025-36c07d3dc7c03f66f86f44409d504d43)
 building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli [airstrike](https://apnews.com/live/latest-updates-israel-launches-new-wave-of-airstrikes-across-gaza-after-ceasefire-talks-stall)
.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:59>)
web_search("Palestinian child rubble Gaza Israeli airstrike")
image_search("child trapped rubble Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News reported on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother. The war began on October 7, 2023. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents))

The New Arab published an article on June 3, 2025, about a baby rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. The article mentions that widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The article also mentions that more than 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded since October 2023. <image:59>

### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published a video about rescue workers fighting to save children trapped in Gaza City airstrike rubble. (<image:10680>) Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the Israeli war on Gaza's children, which includes an image of children near rubble. (<image:10681>)

*   [https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

The Associated Press published an article on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother.

The Wikipedia article mentions that in July 2024, the number of unaccompanied children was likely to be above the February 2024 estimate of 17,000.

Save the Children published an article about children in Gaza, including an image of a child standing in front of rubble. ([https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza](https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza)) <image:10688> VPM.org published an article on October 7, 2024, with photos from the year since October 7, including an image of children near rubble.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, with a high probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel. The web searches and image searches provide additional context, showing that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes, and many have been killed or wounded. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.
