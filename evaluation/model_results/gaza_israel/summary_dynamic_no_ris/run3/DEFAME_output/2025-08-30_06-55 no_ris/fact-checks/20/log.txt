Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/trump-condoms-gaza): 
Content: The Guardian reports that the claim originated from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing research from Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The article states that Doge and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. The Guardian also mentions that a comprehensive report issued by USAID shows that no money was spent on condoms in Gaza. The article was published on January 29, 2025. <image:10158>

The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **partially supported and partially refuted**. While the claim originated from the White House, citing research from DOGE and OMB, evidence from sources like The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/trump-condoms-gaza)) indicates that USAID spent no money on condoms in Gaza, contradicting the claim's core assertion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
