## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the provided image depicts the assassination. The image geolocation data suggests the image was taken in Cambodia, Pakistan, or other countries, while the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran.

The evidence indicates that the assassination was caused by an explosion in his guesthouse. The image shows a building with a damaged facade, but it is not possible to determine if this is the location of the assassination.

Therefore, the claim is unverified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an image of the building where Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated (![image 10384](media/2025-08-30_07-10-1756537843-017854.jpg)). Al Jazeera reports that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, on July 31, 2024 (![image 10385](media/2025-08-30_07-10-1756537843-258553.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The provided image does not depict the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence shows that the assassination occurred in Tehran, Iran, and the image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in a different country. Furthermore, the evidence includes an image of the actual building where the assassination took place, which does not match the image in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The initial evidence indicated that the image's location was not in Iran, where the assassination occurred. Further investigation revealed an image of the actual building where the assassination took place, which does not match the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, on July 31, 2024, the image provided does not depict the assassination site. The image's geolocation data suggests a different location, and the actual building where the assassination occurred is different from the one in the image, as confirmed by sources like CNN and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media)).
