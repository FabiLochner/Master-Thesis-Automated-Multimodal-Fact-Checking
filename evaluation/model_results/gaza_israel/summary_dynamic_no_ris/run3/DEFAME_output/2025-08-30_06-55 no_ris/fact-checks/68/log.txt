Useful result: From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/04/742153/Israeli-airstrike-destroys-weapons-depot-in-Syria-s-Dayr-al-Zawr--Reports): 
Content: The search result from PressTV, published on February 4, 2025, reports that Israeli military aircraft carried out an airstrike against a weapons depot near Dayr al-Zawr, Syria, causing a massive explosion. <image:10570>. The article mentions that the attack occurred after the collapse of the Syrian government. The article also includes a video grab of the aftermath of the airstrike.

The claim '<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported. While evidence confirms Israeli airstrikes in Syria in February 2025, including attacks on weapons depots, there's no evidence to support the specific detail that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots in the surroundings of Southern Damascus. The provided source mentions a weapons depot near Dayr al-Zawr, not Damascus.

So, the overall veracity is: false
