Useful result: From [Source](https://belux.edmo.eu/image-of-palestinian-carrying-children-out-of-rubble-shows-signs-of-ai/): 
Content: The AFP published an article on November 2, 2023, stating that an image of a man carrying children through rubble, shared on social media, is likely AI-generated. The article mentions that the image circulated widely on social media, as early as October 21, 2023. <image:10490>, <image:10491>, <image:10492>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://cedmohub.eu/image-of-child-trapped-under-rubble-predates-gaza-war-and-shows-signs-of-ai/): 
Content: The AFP fact-check, published on November 29, 2023, debunks an image of a child trapped in rubble, claiming it predates the Gaza war and shows signs of AI generation. <image:10498>, <image:10502>, <image:10499>, <image:10500>. The image was shared online as early as February 2023, months before the war. An expert identified anomalies suggesting AI generation.

Useful result: From [Source](https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/beneath-the-rubble): 
Content: Reuters published an article about a Reuters photographer, Ibraheem Abu Mustafa, capturing the scene of a 10-year-old boy being pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza after an Israeli air strike. The article does not contain the image in the claim. The article was published in 2023.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While the image's geolocation analysis suggests it was taken in Palestine, and there is evidence of children being found in rubble in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes, there is no evidence to confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the date (April 2025) or the cause of the children's death. Furthermore, the search results show that images related to the conflict are often fact-checked, and some have been debunked as AI-generated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
