Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/bombing): 
Content: The search result from Getty Images contains images related to explosions and bombings. <image:10087>, <image:10088>, <image:10089>, <image:10090>, <image:10091>, <image:10092>, <image:10093>, <image:10094>, <image:10095>, <image:10096>, <image:10097>, <image:10098>, <image:10099>, <image:10100>, <image:10101>, <image:10102>, <image:10103>, <image:10104>, <image:10105>, <image:10106>, <image:10107>, <image:10108>, <image:10109>.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The image, likely taken in Palestine or Israel, was captured by the Anadolu Agency and does not depict the U.S. bombarding Yemen. The search results reveal images of bombings in Gaza and Ukraine, contradicting the claim's context of the U.S. bombing Yemen on December 22, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
