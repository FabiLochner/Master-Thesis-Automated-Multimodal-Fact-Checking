Content: Nature.com discusses a bill proposing stringent restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel. The bill was passed by the Israeli parliament's science committee. The article is written by Haim Watzman and was published on July 16, 1998.

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government ([Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and other sources indicates that DNA testing is used in Israel, particularly for determining Jewish identity for immigration, and that there are regulations on the use of genetic information, not a prohibition on testing.

So, the overall veracity is: false
