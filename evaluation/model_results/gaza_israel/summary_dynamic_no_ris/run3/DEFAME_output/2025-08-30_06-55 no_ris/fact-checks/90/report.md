## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). The ESPN article notes that this is not the first time an Algerian athlete has withdrawn from a match against Butbul. ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg), <image:i>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics. However, the reason provided is that Dris failed to make weight, not that he withdrew. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances.

The ESPN article ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) mentions that this is not the first time an Algerian athlete has withdrawn from a match against Butbul.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. While an Algerian judoka did not compete against an Israeli opponent, the reason given was failing to make weight, not a withdrawal. The evidence suggests the situation is under investigation.

`false`
