Spot the pattern. Mike Tyson at AT&amp;amp;T Stadium on November 15, 2024 in Arlington, Texas. 28, 2025

* * *

In a display that fell short of even the most measured expectations that come with gimmick fights, [Jake Paul](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6435868/2025/06/26/jake-paul-boxing-julio-cesar-chavez-jr/)
 breezed past a 58-year-old Mike Tyson on Friday night in a bout that was heavy on nostalgia and bombast but lacking in any sort of competitive satisfaction.

Tyson landed just 18 punches in eight sluggish rounds. in 2021, shot back a puzzled look and a quick retort: “I’ll kill you, Mike.”

Netflix declined comment [on its technical issues,](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5925844/2024/11/16/netflix-buffering-freezing-jake-paul-mike-tyson/)
 which came in the leadup to the Tyson-Paul bout and especially undercut the most thrilling bout on the card, Katie Taylor’s controversial decision win over Amanda Serrano. By then, they were both surely richer by millions and the fight that didn’t matter in the first place proved to be one that fans wanted to quickly forget.

Advertisement

It was also a mixed night for Netflix, which streamed the bout to its hundreds of millions of subscribers without charging extra fees, but struggled to keep up with clearly high demand and widespread complaints of freezing, buffering and resolution problems.

“I wanted to give the fans a show but I didn’t want to hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt,” [Paul](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6460122/2025/06/29/jake-paul-julio-cesar-chavez-jr-result/)
 told reporters afterward.

For about 60 seconds, it looked like Tyson might thrill the packed AT&T Stadium crowd in Arlington, Texas, with a momentary flashes of the presence he had during his heyday in the ’80s and early ’90s. But for the next 15 minutes, plus some breaks for deep breaths, he looked exactly like a man nearing his 60th birthday who hadn’t fought a professional boxing match in 19 years.

Paul spent much of the fight dancing around Tyson. Paul pieced him up with elementary combinations and some sharp left hooks, but even his glancing blows drew some reaction from a clearly underwhelmed crowd seeking any kind of highlight.

Afterward, Paul said it was an honor to share the ring with Tyson and called the former champion the GOAT.

As for the exhausted Tyson, he said he was “totally happy” with his performance, while admitting he went into the fight with an injury. His 11-1 record is padded with wins over subpar competition, and his one loss was to Tommy Fury, who boxes but had been better known as a reality TV personality and the half brother of Tyson Fury, the heavyweight star.

Paul didn’t call out any new opponents, but did say that he was the route for boxers to make big paydays, and repeated his claim that he could deliver that even to Canelo Alvarez, who is perhaps the sport’s most bankable star right now.

Paul claimed in the leadup to the fight that he was earning $40 million for the bout with Tyson, though the actual earnings for both headliners was not made public. Clearly, getting in the ring was a victory for both men even though their display barely qualified as a fight.

“There was a point where I was just like, he’s not really engaging back,” Paul said, adding: “I could just tell that his age was showing a little bit.”

Tyson, one of the biggest stars in sports when he was at his height, looked like a shell of the boxer who last fought professionally in 2005."

Following this, Israeli officials informed the security cabinet of Sinwar's likely death.

-------------------------

Wounded Yahya Sinwar stares at a drone sent to inspect the building after an armed clash and tosses a stick at it.

Following Sinwar's death, the IDF released images and drone footage depicting him wounded and slumped in a chair, aiming to portray him as a fugitive. They urged Israeli and US leaders to capitalize on this military success by negotiating an immediate deal for the hostages' release, stressing that true victory can only be achieved when all the captives are safely returned.[\[76\]](#cite_note-77)

The death of Hamas leader [Yahya Sinwar](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/17/nx-s1-5155887/hamas-yahya-sinwar-israel-gaza)
 at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza Wednesday has prompted celebration and concern alike in Israel and beyond. "This is the time to go out, release the hostages, raise your hands, surrender."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Sinwar’s death the "beginning of the day after Hamas," and in a recorded video message said his demise indicated Hamas "will no longer rule Gaza."

Yahya Sinwar, a founder of Hamas' military wing, talks during a rally in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, in 2011. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in Israel represents a potential inflection point in the devastating and widening conflict that has continued into its second year.

The militant group confirmed Sinwar’s death in a statement released Friday. The Hamas political bureau said that it was “painful and distressing” to lose its leader, and declared that he has now become “an icon for the Palestinian people.”

The Palestinian militant group killed some 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages during the surprise attacks, according to Israeli officials.

### [How Yahya Sinwar's killing could affect Israel-Hamas negotiations](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157191/how-yahya-sinwars-killing-could-affect-israel-hamas-negotiations)

In response, Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians and injured more than 99,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. But the fact Sinwar was located and killed above ground suggests, Israeli's military leaders have said, that the group's options for safety are continuing to shrink.

But Sinwar’s death may complicate efforts to achieve one of Israel's goals for the military [occupation of Gaza that began](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27175/israel-hamas-war-gaza-map)
 12 months ago.

"Killing Sinwar means Israel has no one to talk to about the hostages in Gaza," said Kareem Jouda, a lawyer from Gaza. "They can do absolutely nothing bigger than what they have been doing," he added.

At Israel's border with Gaza Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called on remaining Hamas fighters in Gaza to take this moment to surrender.

"Yahya Sinwar ended his life being beaten, persecuted, fleeing for his life, not in command of his organization and only taking care of himself," he said. <image:10154>

A demonstrator holds a sign about the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a protest calling for a cease-fire deal and the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas on Thursday, in Tel Aviv, Israel. "The ball is in the hands of the Israeli government."  

Hostages key to any cease-fire
------------------------------

Israeli authorities believe there are still 101 hostages held inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead, and for many of Israel's political elite, their return has now become the most crucial element to any potential cessation of hostilities, not just in Gaza but the wider region.

"Now, more than ever, we must act in every way possible to bring back the 101 hostages who are still being held in horrific conditions," Israeli President Isaac Herzog [wrote on social media](https://x.com/isaac_herzog/status/1846958555741491622)
.

Benny Gantz, a former head of the Israeli military and defense ministry and political rival of Netanyahu, [posted on social media](https://x.com/gantzbe/status/1846963282420084895?s=46)
 that Sinwar's death sent a message to Israel's enemies that the country's military would not rest until they "pay for their crimes." But he also said it should be leveraged to see hostages returned, while suggesting that Israeli forces would continue to operate inside Gaza for years to come.

Netanyahu noted this was "an important moment in the war," and insisted it was his "highest commitment" that the country's military and intelligence services would continue "with all our strength" to return the hostages.

In a public statement, the Israeli prime minister even promised a form of amnesty for surviving members of Hamas if they helped return captives."

### [Jon B. Alterman](/people/jon-b-alterman)

Published October 17, 2024

Remote Visualization

The Israeli government announced today that its soldiers had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a firefight in southern Gaza. Sinwar seemed strongly opposed to compromise, so his death makes some sort of settlement more possible. Some may execute hostages in retribution for Sinwar’s death, some may seek to trade their hostages’ freedom for their own, and some may simply abandon hostages out of fear of what comes next. Sinwar’s death is important to Israelis who wanted to ensure that Hamas did not resurrect itself in Gaza. Because many Palestinians regarded Sinwar as a charismatic figure with credibility, his death weakens Hamas’s control over Gaza’s population. Israeli assassinations of previous Hamas leaders have not dampened that appeal, and Sinwar’s death is unlikely to, either. Whether this is a barrier to broader engagement in a post-Hamas future, or whether Israel and others can reach some understanding on this, will be a focus of discussions for the next several months.

**Q5: How will this play in Israeli politics?**

**A5:** In the immediate term, Sinwar’s death is a massive victory for Netanyahu."

**Claim:** "UNRWA appears to be mourning the death of Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar is considered the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel in which Hamas and other militant organizations killed more than 1,200 people and abducted another 250 people into Gaza. 

Since Sinwar's death, there have been many posts on X claiming that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) changed its account's  profile picture and added the black ribbon to its logo as a sign of mourning for him.

Israel's military killed its top target in Gaza, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz [confirmed late on Thursday](/en/hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-killed-in-gaza-israel/a-70524393)
. The claim can be found in several viral X posts [calling for a defunding](https://archive.ph/jCCIQ "External link — calling for a defunding")
 of the UN organization as it is allegedly mourning the death of the head of Hamas.

**DW Fact check:** False

The black ribbon alongside the UNRWA logo symbolizes solidarity with the victims of war and has been a part of the X account's profile picture since at least October 22, 2023, when UNRWA announced in a [post on X](https://archive.ph/djuKR "External link — post on X")
 that it was in shock and mourning after the killing of 29 of its colleagues in Gaza since October 7. On its official Facebook account, UNRWA changed its profile picture to the UNRWA logo and the black ribbon on [October 11, 2023](https://archive.ph/bupKv "External link — October 11, 2023")
. 

The black ribbon alongside the UNRWA logo has been a part of the X account's profile picture since at least October 22Image: UNRWA/X.com

We have looked at several UNRWA social media accounts on different social media platforms, but not all have the black ribbon on their profile images. All UNRWA accounts added a black stripe to their profile," says [this post](https://archive.ph/6ctDD "External link — this post")
 on X. On X, the [EU account of UNRWA](https://x.com/UNRWA_EU "External link — EU account of UNRWA")
 has the ribbon but the [UNRWA USA](https://x.com/unrwausa "External link — UNRWA USA")
, for example, does not.   

[DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 has reached out to UNRWA for a statement.

UNRWA target of disinformation campaigns
----------------------------------------

At the beginning of 2024, Israel claimed that some 450 UNRWA workers in Gaza were "terrorists." [A review](/en/unrwa-review-finds-neutrality-issues-no-terror-proof/a-68893802)
 of the UN agency's neutrality was prompted due to these accusations. However, the 54-page report identified "neutrality-related issues" in the implementation of the "robust" procedures UNRWA has in place to "ensure compliance with the humanitarian principles of neutrality."

Since then, the UN organization has been the target of [claims on social media](https://archive.ph/uEGYu "External link — claims on social media")
 that it is supporting terrorists, and calls to end to its funding. 

Due to the variety and amount of claims, the UNRWA addressed the main allegations in a [Claims versus Facts](https://www.unrwa.org/unrwa-claims-versus-facts-february-2024 "External link — Claims versus Facts")
 page published on its official website in May 2024.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("UNRWA Yahya Sinwar death")
image_search("UNRWA profile picture mourning")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Yahya_Sinwar)) discusses the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, on October 16, 2024, and mentions that a UNRWA teacher's passport was found on his person. The NPR article ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)) discusses the death of Yahya Sinwar and reactions to it.

The CSIS article ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-yahya-sinwars-death-mean)) discusses the death of Yahya Sinwar, stating that the Israeli government announced that its soldiers had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. <image:18>, <image:10153>, <image:10154>, <image:10156>


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-banning-unrwa-palestinian-territories-gaza-hamas-west-bank-rcna189554): 
Content: The NBC News article discusses Israel's ban on UNRWA in Palestinian territories. <image:10160>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, died in October 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about UNRWA placing a black band over its profile photo in mourning for Sinwar. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

     The video was then removed by the company.[\[345\]](#cite_note-346)
     The conspiracy theory that some people had foreknowledge is based on the fact that on July 12, 2024, one day before the assassination attempt, the investment company Austin Private Wealth filed a report with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "Securities and Exchange Commission")
     indicating that it had [shorted](/wiki/Shorted "Shorted")
     12 million shares of [Trump Media & Technology Group](/wiki/Trump_Media_%26_Technology_Group "Trump Media & Technology Group")
     (ticker symbol DJT), thus betting that the value of the stock would decrease.[\[346\]](#cite_note-Frank_Chung-2024-347)

Routh was active in recruiting volunteers to fight in Ukraine's war against Russia, and had a range of eclectic political views, although he was registered as a Democrat and made anti-Trump posts online.

In an earlier letter this year, the 59-year-old had asked to be used in a prisoner swap with another country like Russia so he could have a "swift and useful" death.

Trump assassination attempt suspect can represent himself at trial, judge rules

Routh has said he and his attorneys "a million miles apart"

A man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year will be allowed to represent himself at trial, a court has ruled.

Ryan Routh, 59, is charged with trying to assassinate then-candidate Trump by aiming a rifle through a fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.

US District Judge Aileen Cannon approved his request to represent himself at trial, but ordered court-appointed attorneys to remain on standby. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm charges.

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.

Routh has been held in a Florida jail since last September, when he was arrested on a main highway after fleeing Trump's golf course. He had been spotted with his rifle barrel poking through a fence at the oceanfront golf course before a Secret Service agent saw him and fired in his direction.

Police say Routh hid for nearly 12 hours in the bushes waiting for Trump, who was playing golf.

Court records suggest Routh had been plotting his attack on the then-presidential candidate for months.

He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result.

Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life as he ran for office."

The [Iran–Israel War](/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war "Iran–Israel war")
 that escalated after [October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
 has imposed severe economic burdens on [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
. Neverthless, the Israel currency appriciated against the US Dollar and the Israeli stock exchange hit new records.

Key economic impacts on Iran
----------------------------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Category | Impact on Iran |
| War damage (2025 conflict) | Widespread destruction across  21 provinces (airports, energy facilities, military and nuclear sites) requiring extensive reconstruction and tens of billions of dollars in rebuilding costs.[\[1\]](#cite_note-:0-1)<br>[\[4\]](#cite_note-:8-4) |
| Military spending &  proxies | More than $20 billion spent supporting allied militias since 2012 (e.g. up to $700 million/year to [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")<br> at its peak).[\[5\]](#cite_note-:1-5) |
| Ballistic missile costs | A single [Iranian missile barrage (Oct 2024)](/wiki/True_promise_2 "True promise 2")<br> cost ~$2.3 billion in materiel (≈22% of Iran’s annual defense budget), far outweighing the defenders’ interception  costs in terms of GDP.[\[6\]](#cite_note-:6-6) |
| Sanctions revenue loss | An estimated $300–450 billion in oil income lost over the past decade due to international sanctions.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Khatinoglu-7)<br> Oil exports fell to ~200,000 barrels/day in  2022–23 (under 10% of 2016 levels).[\[8\]](#cite_note-:2-8) |
| Currency & inflation | The rial has lost over 90% of  its value against the dollar since 2018,[\[9\]](#cite_note-:7-9)<br> plummeting to record lows (over 1,000,000 IRR per USD in 2024–25) amid war fears.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)<br> Inflation exceeds 40–50% annually.[\[8\]](#cite_note-:2-8) |
| Human capital losses | At least half a dozen top nuclear scientists assassinated since 2010 (with more killed in 2025 strikes), and  multiple senior IRGC commanders killed.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:3-11)<br>[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)<br>[\[13\]](#cite_note-13) |

Historical context and economic pessures
----------------------------------------

### Decades of hostility and sanctions

Since the [1979 Islamic Revolution](/wiki/Iranian_Revolution "Iranian Revolution")
, Iran and Israel have been locked in enmity with profound economic implications. By 2022–2023 Iran’s oil export income was only about $50 billion per year (roughly 200,000 barrels per day), less than 10% of its peak before sanctions.[\[8\]](#cite_note-:2-8)
 Cumulatively, Iranian officials estimate that international sanctions have cost the country on the order of $300–450 billion in lost oil revenues over a decade.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Khatinoglu-7)
 This loss of foreign exchange has gutted Iran’s development spending, leaving infrastructure dilapidated and cutting access to hard currency needed for investment.[\[8\]](#cite_note-:2-8)
[\[1\]](#cite_note-:0-1)
 Even before the latest conflict, Iran’s government warned that the economic situation was more dire than during the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War, as sanctions and mismanagement led to infrastructure crises requiring over $500 billion to fix.[\[1\]](#cite_note-:0-1)

### Proxy conflict strategy

In lieu of direct war, Iran has long engaged Israel indirectly by funding and arming proxy militias across the region. Iran’s leaders openly prioritize financing these groups – described by [Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei](/wiki/Ali_Khamenei "Ali Khamenei")
 as the “backbone of war” – even at the expense of domestic needs.[\[5\]](#cite_note-:1-5)
 From 2013–2017 (during the loosening of sanctions under the nuclear deal), Iran increased military and proxy expenditures by over 20%, only to cut back by 22% after oil sanctions returned in 2018.[\[5\]](#cite_note-:1-5)
 When oil revenue rebounded in 2021–2023 (due in part to covert sales to [China](/wiki/China "China")
), Tehran again boosted funding for the IRGC and militias despite economic hardships at home.[\[5\]](#cite_note-:1-5)
 This cycle shows how Iran’s proxy warfare strategy imposes a chronic [opportunity cost](/wiki/Opportunity_cost "Opportunity cost")
 on its economy: resources funneled into regional conflict could otherwise address infrastructure, jobs, and social services, areas where Iran now falls behind its neighbors.[\[14\]](#cite_note-:5-14)

### Covert operations and sabotage

[Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
, for its part, has waged a long-running shadow war aimed at undermining Iran’s nuclear and military capabilities – with economic side effects. Israel also allegedly carried out cyber-sabotage such as the 2010 [Stuxnet](/wiki/Stuxnet "Stuxnet")
 attack, which destroyed [uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium")
 [centrifuges](/wiki/Centrifuge "Centrifuge")
, and a series of mysterious explosions and power outages at facilities like [Natanz](/wiki/Natanz_Nuclear_Facility "Natanz Nuclear Facility")
 in 2020 and 2021.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:3-11)
 Each such incident forced Iran to spend time and money repairing sensitive nuclear infrastructure and adding security, effectively raising the economic cost of its nuclear program. While exact figures are closely guarded, the disruption has been significant – for example, an explosion at Natanz in April 2021 damaged or destroyed thousands of centrifuges, prompting Iranian officials to decry the “nuclear terrorism” that necessitated expensive restoration work.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:3-11)
 In addition, since 2018 Israeli airstrikes in [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria")
 have repeatedly hit IRGC supply lines and weapons depots intended for Hezbollah, indirectly compelling Iran to expend more resources to maintain its regional reach.[\[15\]](#cite_note-:4-15)
 Over the past year, Israel even began targeting IRGC operatives directly; several senior IRGC commanders were killed in 2023–2024 (for instance, in alleged Israeli strikes on Iranian positions in Syria).[\[15\]](#cite_note-:4-15)

### The escalation of 2023–25

Tensions flared dangerously after [October 7, 2023, when Hamas (a Palestinian group backed by Iran) launched a massive surprise attack on Israel.](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
 Israel’s retaliatory war against [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 in [Gaza](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 raised fears that Iran and its other proxies might directly enter the war. American officials reported that Tehran had provided Hamas with weapons, training, and funding leading up to the October 7 assault.[\[5\]](#cite_note-:1-5)
 In the immediate aftermath, Iran’s fragile economy shuddered – the _rial_ currency plunged in value amid public expectations of harsher sanctions or even war. The government’s fiscal health also weakened as oil revenues underperformed: in the first seven months of the Iranian year (to October 2023) budget income was 30% below projections, partly due to lower oil exports.[\[14\]](#cite_note-:5-14)

Escalation into open war (June 2025)
------------------------------------

### Destruction of infrastructure

Israeli bombing raids hit critical infrastructure in Iran across 21 of the country’s 31 provinces.[\[4\]](#cite_note-:8-4)
 Targets included major airports (such as [Tabriz Airport](/wiki/Tabriz_Shahid_Madani_International_Airport "Tabriz Shahid Madani International Airport")
 and [Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport](/wiki/Mehrabad_International_Airport "Mehrabad International Airport")
), oil and gas facilities, power grids, and strategically important industries."

ORLANDO, Florida, June 16 (Reuters) - A dramatic spike in the potential for all-out war between Israel and Iran would typically be expected to spark an immediate and strong rally in the U.S. dollar, with investors seeking the safety and liquidity of the world's reserve currency.

That didn't happen on Friday.

The dollar's response to Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, followed by Tehran's initial threats and retaliation, was pretty feeble. Yet a significant geopolitical shock generated barely a knee-jerk bounce.

For comparison, the dollar rose more than 2% in both the first week of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War and in the week following Israel's invasion of Southern Lebanon last year.

The dollar's weak response to this latest Middle East conflict supports the narrative that investors are now reassessing their high exposure to dollars, in light of some of the unorthodox policies put forward by U.S. This idea was first outlined over 20 years ago by then currency analyst and now hedge fund manager Stephen Jen.

If the Israel-Iran conflict continues to escalate, that dollar smile could get rather lopsided.

As a ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump holds for a second day, the damage from the 12-day war between Israel and Iran is becoming clearer. Not quite.**](https://trt.global/world/article/39eb19713bb9)

The 12-day conflict also left deep scars on Iran and Israel, strained regional supply chains, and sent ripples through global energy and trade markets.

As the ceasefire holds, the full cost of this war is still unfolding.

**Iran’s toll** 

“The 12-day war between Iran and Israel this June inflicted substantial economic damage across the region, though the burden was uneven,” says Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King’s College London and director of MENA Analytica.

Iran, already under decades of Western sanctions, bore the heavier toll.

In an interview with _TRT World_, Krieg, a defence analyst, estimates total direct and indirect losses between $24–$35 billion, equivalent to approximately 6.3 – 9.2% of Iran’s estimated $380 billion GDP.

US and Israeli strikes degraded Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and caused a sharp drop in Tehran’s oil exports. Damage to energy installations and military infrastructure threatens to deepen Iran’s structural weaknesses and delay its post-war recovery. 

“The war has deepened Iran’s fiscal and social challenges, with lasting implications for its internal stability,” says Aimen Jamil, an Islamabad-based expert on Iranian affairs.

**US and Israel’s toll**

Israel [spent](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 approximately $5 billion in the first week of strikes on Iran, with daily war costs hitting $725 million—$593 million for offensive operations and $132 million for defence and mobilisation.

Anti-missile systems alone cost Israel between $10 million and $200 million per day, according to [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-war-on-iran-is-costing-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-a-day-1d360353)
_._

Had the conflict continued for a full month, total costs might have [exceeded](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 $12 billion, estimates the Aaron Institute for Economic Policy.

Israel, though economically more resilient, was not unscathed, according to Krieg.

He estimates losses of $11.5 billion to $17.8 billion, or 2.1–3.3% of its $540 billion GDP.

“These figures include military expenditures, infrastructure damage, and the interception of over 400 Iranian missiles,” Krieg adds. <image:10374>\

A visible exodus has also begun.

All these factors have made Israel’s warlike government take a toll, prompting “a visible exodus” of Israel’s dual citizens, alarmed by the frequency and reach of missile attacks on strategic sites like oil refineries and major cities, according to Kreig. 

Israel’s [Central Bureau of Statistics](https://www.jpost.com/tags/central-bureau-of-statistics)
 estimates that more than 80,000 Israelis left the country in 2024, which corresponds to the highest number since the Zionist state’s founding in 1948. [Nearly half a million](https://thecradle.co/articles/nearly-500000-fled-israel-since-7-october#:~:text=Data%20from%20Israel's%20Population%20and,or%20not%2C%20the%20report%20says.)
 have left since October 7, 2023.

Over 10,000 Israelis [evacuated](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-06-24/ty-article/.premium/how-october-7-is-shaping-support-for-israelis-displaced-by-iranian-missile-attacks/00000197-9e4e-d6fd-ad97-9f5e734d0000)
 in the war’s first week, with more than 36,000 filing for compensation, according to the Israel Tax Authority.

Facing a widening budget deficit, the government is [weighing](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 spending cuts, tax hikes, or increased borrowing, which could push public debt above 75% of GDP.

The Finance Ministry, warning of dwindling reserves, [requested](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 $857 million for defence while proposing $200 million in cuts to health, education, and social services.

In a controversial move, Israel’s government recently [imposed a travel ban](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-06-19/ty-article-magazine/.premium/visiting-israeli-expats-are-stranded-in-their-homeland-with-no-way-home/00000197-8929-d6c0-a1b7-e93992780000)
 on Jewish citizens, apparently to slow this outflow.

Experts see it as a sign of Israel’s growing insecurity and reputational damage from different wars it has engaged in. Widespread flight cancellations and rerouted paths raised airline operating costs, although she sees these impacts as “limited and temporary” at the global level.

The US government has brought charges against an Afghan national in connection with an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump before he was elected as the next president.

The Department of Justice on Friday unsealed an indictment against Farhad Shakeri, 51, alleging he was tasked with “providing a plan” to kill Trump.

The US government said Mr Shakeri has not been arrested and is believed to be in Iran - which described the claims as "completely baseless".

In a criminal complaint filed in Manhattan court, prosecutors allege that an official in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard directed Mr Shakeri in September to devise a plan to surveil and kill Trump.

“The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran’s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.

The justice department also charged two others allegedly recruited to kill an American journalist who was an outspoken critic of Iran.

The other individuals were identified by the justice department as Carlisle Rivera, also known as "Pop", 49, from Brooklyn, and Jonathon Loadholt, 36, from Staten Island.

The two appeared in court in the Southern District of New York on Thursday and are being detained pending a trial.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said similar accusations of attempts to assassinate US presidents had been made in the past, which Iran denied and went on to be false.

In a statement, Mr Baghaei added that repeating such claims risked "further complicating the issues between the US and Iran".

Trump has faced two separate alleged assassination attempts this year. <image:10418>!Getty Images Donald Trump looks ahead with a serious expression on his face. "I want to fight against tyranny, and I deserve to be safe."

In addition to the American journalist and Trump, the indictment alleges the Iranian government sought to kill two Jewish American businesspeople living in New York City, who were supportive of Israel on social media.

Mr Shakeri also told prosecutors that his Iranian contacts asked him to plan a mass shooting to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka in October 2024, a year after the Hamas attacks on Israel.

Mr Shakeri, Mr Rivera and Mr Loadholt were all charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. They also face counts of money laundering conspiracy - which could lead to 20 years in prison - and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire.

US charges man over alleged Iranian plot to kill Trump

! In July, a gunman grazed the former president's ear after shooting at him during a Pennsylvania rally.

Then, in September, a man was arrested for pointing a rifle at Trump who was golfing on his course in West Palm Beach.

Mr Shakeri was asked to come up with a plan to kill Trump in seven days, the indictment alleges.

According to prosecutors, Mr Shakeri told law enforcement that he did not intend to propose a scheme to kill Trump within that seven-day timeframe, so the Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials put the plan on pause.

Mr Shakeri said the Iranian government told him it would be easier to try to assassinate Trump after the election, because they believed he would lose, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors described Mr Shakeri as an Afghan national who came to the US when he was a child."

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with planning the assassination of the Republican president-elect.

Investigators were told of the plan to kill Trump by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots.

Shakeri told the FBI that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to set aside other work he was doing and assemble a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.

The official was quoted by Shakeri as saying that “We have already spent a lot of money" and that “money’s not an issue.” Shakeri told investigators the official told him that if he could not put together a plan within the seven-day timeframe, then the plot would be paused until after the election because the official assumed Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him then, the complaint said.

The criminal complaint says Shakeri disclosed some of the details of the alleged plots in a series of recorded telephone interviews with FBI agents while in Iran. The stated reason for his cooperation, he told investigators, was to try to get a reduced prison sentence for an associate behind bars in the U.S.

According to the complaint, though officials determined that some of the information he provided was false, his statements regarding a plot to kill Trump and Iran's willingness to pay large sums of money were determined to be accurate.

The plot, announced by the Justice Department just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, is part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. citizens,” including Trump, “other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran.”

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it."

## Actions
```
web_search("assassination plot Donald Trump 2024")
web_search("Israel war Iran American money")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss an attempted assassination of Donald Trump in 2024. One source from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania)) mentions an attempt in Pennsylvania by Thomas Matthew Crooks, and that the Secret Service had increased Trump's security due to intelligence indicating Iran was plotting to assassinate him. <image:i>

Other sources, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3070qvl131o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3070qvl131o)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/nx-s1-5398066/ryan-routh-assassination-court-hearing-donald-trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/nx-s1-5398066/ryan-routh-assassination-court-hearing-donald-trump)), report on the attempted assassination by Ryan Routh in 2024, with Routh pleading not guilty. <image:10351>, <image:10352>, <image:10353>, <image:10354>, <image:10355>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the economic impact of the Iran-Israel war, including conflicts in 2024 and 2025. One article from Wikipedia ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war)) details the economic burdens on Iran, the historical context of the conflict, and the destruction of infrastructure.

Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/israel-iran-conflict-highlights-dollars-tarnished-safe-haven-appeal-2025-06-16/)) discusses the potential impact of the Israel-Iran conflict on the U.S. dollar, noting its "feeble" response. Another article from TRT ([Source](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)) discusses the economic impact of a 12-day war between Israel and Iran, including costs to the US, Israel, and Iran, and mentions a travel ban on Jewish citizens. <image:10371>, <image:10374>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. The search results mention two attempted assassinations, one by Thomas Matthew Crooks and another by Ryan Routh, but do not provide any information about their religious or ethnic backgrounds.

The evidence also does not directly support the claim that Israel wants war with Iran and wants American money and servicemen. However, the search results do discuss the economic impact of the Iran-Israel war, including costs to the US, Israel, and Iran.

Iran launched a barrage of missiles against Israel overnight and into Sunday, with Israeli authorities reporting that more than 80 people were wounded, the vast majority of them lightly.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the time for diplomacy had passed and his country had the right to defend itself.

“The warmongering, a lawless administration in Washington is solely and fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far-reaching implications of its act of aggression,” he said in a news conference in Istanbul.

Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who had threatened to resume attacks on U.S. vessels in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joined Israel’s military campaign, called on other Muslim nations to form “one front against the Zionist-American arrogance.”

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The United States inserted itself into Israel’s war against Iran, bombing three of the Islamic Republic’s key nuclear sites overnight in an attack it dubbed “Operation Midnight Hammer.” U.S. The war so far has killed hundreds of people and wounded more than 1,000 in Iran and killed two dozen and wounded hundreds in Israel.

Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb, Trump and Israeli leaders have argued it could quickly assemble a nuclear weapon, making it an imminent threat.

The region has been on edge for the past two years as Israel seeks to annihilate the Hamas militant group, an Iranian ally, in the Gaza Strip, where war still rages after Hamas’ Oct. on Wednesday that strikes against Iran would “result in irreparable damage for them.”

The Israeli military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran’s foreign minister warned before the U.S. President Trump meets Israeli PM Netanyahu in Washington <image:10503>

*   Cumulative total of military operations, missile damage, reconstruction, and compensations could inflate Israel’s financial burden to double-digit billions

**ISTANBUL**

A shaky ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding for now, offering both nations a chance to assess the extensive damage incurred during 12 days of intense conflict.

The ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday, came after days of direct confrontation that inflicted significant human, economic, and infrastructural losses.

Israel and the US have maintained that the operation achieved its goal of damaging Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but experts and reports highlight the steep financial toll incurred by both nations, particularly Israel.

**Israel’s military expenditure soars**

After initiating the conflict with airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities, Israel faced severe retaliation in the form of hundreds of missiles and drone attacks.

Operating missile defense systems such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow cost Israel up to 1 billion shekels ($285 million) per day, according to TheMarker, the economic section of Israeli news outlet Haaretz. Current hotel accommodation costs alone are estimated at 100 million shekels ($29 million).

“In total, the Tax Authority’s Compensation Fund is expected to pay at least 9 billion shekels (nearly $2.7 billion),” the report said.

Naser Abdelkarim, an assistant professor of finance at the American University of Palestine, estimated Israel’s total losses – direct and indirect – could reach as high as $20 billion.

Speaking to Anadolu, Abdelkarim said the conflict had sharply increased Israel’s military expenditures, disrupted employment, and negatively impacted production and business sectors.

He added that Israel faces limited options to offset this widening budget deficit: slashing spending on critical sectors such as health and education, increasing taxes, or borrowing money, potentially pushing its public debt-to-income ratio beyond 75%.

At the official level, Israel’s Finance Ministry has acknowledged its strained resources, recently requesting an additional $857 million for defense, alongside proposed cuts of $200 million from health, education, and social services.

**US: Cost of shift from support to direct involvement**

Initially supporting Israel’s defensive efforts, the US became directly involved on June 22 with a series of strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.

According to the Pentagon, the operation involved 125 US military aircraft, including B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, refueling tankers, and support aircraft.

Seven B-2 bombers targeted Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, while 24 cruise missiles were fired at Isfahan from a submarine. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. Interceptor missiles, particularly those used by David’s Sling and Arrow systems, individually cost between $1 million and $4 million.

Moreover, Israel remained on the offensive throughout the conflict, conducting hundreds of airstrikes on Iranian sites.

Each sortie by fighter jets like the advanced F-35 costs approximately $10,000 per flying hour, with additional expenses for refueling aircraft and ammunition. Overall, the Israeli business daily Calcalist estimates Israel’s combined defensive and offensive operations totaled approximately $5 billion.

**Impact in Israel: ‘Never been this level of damage before’**

The cumulative impact of missile damage, reconstruction, and compensations could significantly inflate Israel’s financial burden to double-digit billions.

Israel faces “challenges of a magnitude we’ve never faced in history,” said Shai Aharonovich, head of the Israeli Tax Authority, at a press conference Tuesday.

Amir Dahan, an official with the authority’s Compensation Department, also said “there has never been this level of damage before,” according to Calcalist.

The Israeli government expects to pay over 5 billion shekels ($1.5 billion) in property damage claims and evacuations, with around 40,000 claims already filed and more anticipated, the report said.

Some 25,000 claims were made in Tel Aviv, 10,800 in Ashkelon, and 2,600 in Haifa and Acre, according to Tax Authority data.

Approximately 15,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, with about 11,000 accommodated in hotels and another 4,000 staying with friends and relatives.

The government finances two-week hotel stays, with extensions possible, while those staying privately receive 4,000 shekels (around $1,200). In total, 75 precision-guided weapons were used in the operation.

The B-2 is the most expensive aircraft in US military history, costing approximately $2.2 billion per plane, with operating costs ranging from $130,000 to $150,000 per flight hour, according to The New York Times.

The B-2 bombers used in the Iran strikes flew for approximately 37 hours, with operational costs estimated around $56 million.

The bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), or bunker buster bombs, designed to penetrate fortified underground structures, on Fordo.

Each GBU-57 costs between $10 million and $20 million, while the Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines are priced at approximately $2 million each.

Overall, defense analyst Andreas Krieg told Turkish broadcaster TRT World that the total cost of the US operation could range from $1 billion to $2 billion. 30, 2025](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/morning-briefing-aug-30-2025/3673279)

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Anadolu Agency published an article on June 26, 2025, discussing the financial impact of the war between Israel and Iran. <image:k> The article mentions that the US was directly involved in the conflict, with strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. The US operation involved 125 military aircraft and cost between $1 billion to $2 billion. The article also mentions that Israel's military expenditure soared, with the cost of operating missile defense systems costing up to $285 million per day. The cumulative impact of missile damage, reconstruction, and compensations could inflate Israel’s financial burden to double-digit billions.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss an attempted assassination of Donald Trump in 2024. One source from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania)) mentions an attempt in Pennsylvania by Thomas Matthew Crooks, and that the Secret Service had increased Trump's security due to intelligence indicating Iran was plotting to assassinate him. <image:i>

Other sources, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3070qvl131o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3070qvl131o)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/nx-s1-5398066/ryan-routh-assassination-court-hearing-donald-trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/nx-s1-5398066/ryan-routh-assassination-court-hearing-donald-trump)), report on the attempted assassination by Ryan Routh in 2024, with Routh pleading not guilty. <image:10351>, <image:10352>, <image:10353>, <image:10354>, <image:10355>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the economic impact of the Iran-Israel war, including conflicts in 2024 and 2025. One article from Wikipedia ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war)) details the economic burdens on Iran, the historical context of the conflict, and the destruction of infrastructure.

Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/israel-iran-conflict-highlights-dollars-tarnished-safe-haven-appeal-2025-06-16/)) discusses the potential impact of the Israel-Iran conflict on the U.S. dollar, noting its "feeble" response. Another article from TRT ([Source](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)) discusses the economic impact of a 12-day war between Israel and Iran, including costs to the US, Israel, and Iran, and mentions a travel ban on Jewish citizens. <image:10371>, <image:10374>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. The search results mention two attempted assassinations, one by Thomas Matthew Crooks and another by Ryan Routh, but do not provide any information about their religious or ethnic backgrounds.

The evidence also does not directly support the claim that Israel wants war with Iran and wants American money and servicemen. However, the search results do discuss the economic impact of the Iran-Israel war, including costs to the US, Israel, and Iran.

One article from Wikipedia ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war)) details the economic burdens on Iran, the historical context of the conflict, and the destruction of infrastructure.

Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/israel-iran-conflict-highlights-dollars-tarnished-safe-haven-appeal-2025-06-16/)) discusses the potential impact of the Israel-Iran conflict on the U.S. dollar, noting its "feeble" response. Another article from TRT ([Source](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)) discusses the economic impact of a 12-day war between Israel and Iran, including costs to the US, Israel, and Iran, and mentions a travel ban on Jewish citizens. <image:10371>, <image:10374>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. The search results mention two attempted assassinations, one by Thomas Matthew Crooks and another by Ryan Routh, but do not provide any information about their religious or ethnic backgrounds.

The evidence also does not directly support the claim that Israel wants war with Iran and wants American money and servicemen. However, the search results do discuss the economic impact of the Iran-Israel war, including costs to the US, Israel, and Iran.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28x187rmko](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28x187rmko)), ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/3-charged-iran-linked-plot-assassinate-donald-trump/story?id=115646874](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/3-charged-iran-linked-plot-assassinate-donald-trump/story?id=115646874)), and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department)) report on an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump, with charges against Farhad Shakeri. The plot also included plans to kill two Jewish Americans. <image:10419>, <image:10418>, <image:10423>, <image:10424>, <image:10430>, <image:10431>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the United States' support for Israel in the Gaza war, including financial aid and military assistance, as detailed in a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war)). <image:i> A PBS article ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-the-u-s-militarys-intervention-in-the-israel-iran-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-the-u-s-militarys-intervention-in-the-israel-iran-war)) from June 22, 2025, discusses the U.S. military's intervention in the Israel-Iran war, including U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. <image:10503> An Anadolu Agency article ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218)) from June 26, 2025, discusses the financial impact of the war between Israel and Iran, including the US's direct involvement and the soaring military expenditure of Israel. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump included plans to kill two Jewish Americans. The evidence also shows that the U.S. is providing financial and military support to Israel in the Israel-Iran war, including direct military intervention.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially false. While there is evidence of an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump that included plans to kill two Jewish Americans, the claim that Israel orchestrated the plot is not supported by the evidence. The evidence also supports the claim that the U.S. is providing financial and military support to Israel in the Israel-Iran war. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially false. Evidence indicates an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump, which also targeted two Jewish Americans, but there's no evidence linking Israel to the plot. Furthermore, the U.S. is providing financial and military support to Israel in the Israel-Iran war, as documented by sources like the [PBS article](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-the-u-s-militarys-intervention-in-the-israel-iran-war) and the [Anadolu Agency article](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218).

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza
============================================================

### The video actually shows him at a U.S. The video had been shared close to 4,000 times and viewed more than 700,000 at the time of publishing.

The video, and screenshots from the video, were shared with similar captions across multiple platforms in March 2025.

“I’ve got zero sympathy or respect for this Zionist puppet!!” one Facebook user [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10236160829271032&set=a.1416068811808)
 while another on Bluesky [wrote](https://bsky.app/profile/paulwalker44.bsky.social/post/3ljilv7ute227)
“Libs love Zelensky. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

CNN  — 

[Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-front-lines/index.html)
 and Russia exchanged aerial assaults overnight, just hours after the Kremlin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets, but stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire sought by the US.

President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump [spoke by phone](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/politics/trump-putin-ceasefire-russia-ukraine-war/index.html)
 on Tuesday, with the Russian leader not agreeing to the 30-day truce that Trump has endorsed and Ukraine has agreed to. The White House said a narrower pause on attacking energy targets would go into effect followed by negotiations over a broader ceasefire.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday accused Putin of already breaking his pledge, saying that Russia attacked Ukraine with 150 drones overnight, including strikes on energy facilities.

The Kremlin also condemned an overnight attack on an oil facility in Russia, saying it showed Ukraine’s “lack of will” to reach a deal – although Kyiv was not part of the negotiation talks, and no formal agreement has been signed.

Zelensky said Tuesday that while Kyiv supported the pause in attacks on energy targets, he wanted to know the details behind the proposal that Trump and Putin discussed in their bilateral meeting.

“Putin essentially rejected the proposal of a comprehensive ceasefire. There were strikes on transportation, unfortunately, two hospitals were hit, and on urban infrastructure,” Zelensky said during a news conference in Finland.

Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone had caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya, Reuters reported. According to our data, the enemy’s grouping in the Kursk direction currently consists of 70,000 soldiers.”

Content: "The "first steps toward real peace must include forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks against life,” the Ukrainian leader said.

Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight in a large-scale missile and drone attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday.

At least 10 people, including a child, were wounded, authorities said.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko described the attack as "massive" in a post on Facebook.

“Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,” Halushchenko said.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that energy supplies were a legitimate target in the war, as they were linked to Ukraine's "military industrial complex and weapons production."

The attack came hours after Zelenskyy announced that talks with the US on ending the three-year war would take place in Saudi Arabia next week.

The overnight bombardment comes days after Washington announced it would stop sharing military support and intelligence with Ukraine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for an air and sea truce on Friday after Russia bombarded Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight.

Writing on Telegram, he reiterated that there must be "silence" in the seas and skies over Ukraine. Zelenskyy has also proposed ceasing combat operations in the Black Sea to allow safe shipping.

Zelenskyy's proposals contain elements of those suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron during last week's summit of leaders in London.

In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Macron proposed a four-week truce in the "air, sea and on energy infrastructure" that would not cover fighting along the frontline in the east, as this would be complex to "monitor".

France's Foreign Minister Joel-Noel Barrot reiterated that a temporary pause would allow European allies to determine whether Russia was acting in "good faith" when committing to a true.

"That's when real peace negotiations can start," Barrot said.

Russia has not publicly commented on the French proposals for peace.

Also on Tuesday, the Ukrainian leader announced he was ready to work under US President Donald Trump's "strong leadership" to get lasting peace, signalling a turnaround from when he left the White House following a spat between the two last week.

The US temporarily paused both military aid and [intelligence](https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/05/us-puts-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-on-pause-cia-director-says)
 to Ukraine this week following the public argument, although officials suggested that the latter pause would be lifted if Ukraine quickly came back to the negotiating table.

Zelenskyy has faced intense US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, whilst he has been pushing for security guarantees for Kyiv.

Content: "Two crudely launched artillery rockets were launched from a rural area outside Tasil in western Daraa, traversing approximately 10km and landing inside Israeli territory, where they landed in open territory. Then came three rounds of Israeli airstrikes, hitting targets including the 175th Brigade base near Izraa, Daraa; the 121st Brigade, near Kanaker in Rif Dimashq; and Dahr al-Aswad, near Saasaa in Rif Dimashq. A small convoy of armored vehicles also reinforced the IDF’s forward operating base in Ma’ariyah in western Daraa.

Content: "The lack of transparency has sparked growing resentment and anxiety among residents, particularly given the apparent impunity with which Israeli forces operate.

The July 13 incident follows an airborne operation on July 4, near the town of Yaafour, during which Israeli troops parachuted into Syrian territory—an unusual and provocative tactic that drew alarm even among pro-government circles in Daramsuq (Damascus).

While the Quneitra countryside remains under mounting pressure from Israeli military activity, neighboring Daraa Governorate has become the epicenter of civil unrest and grassroots resistance. <image:10566>\

****QUNEITRA / DARAMSUQ (Damascus) —**** The situation in southern Syria continues to deteriorate as Israeli forces launched yet another ground incursion early Sunday morning, this time targeting the towns of Suwaisa and Ain Zaywan in the southern Quneitra countryside. Over the past week, dozens of residents from the town of Tasil and surrounding areas have taken to the streets in anti-Daesh and anti-Israeli demonstrations, protesting what they describe as the return of former Islamic State operatives and the unchecked violations of Syrian sovereignty.

Protesters held banners reading “No to Terror, Yes to Justice” and “Syria is for Syrians, Not for Mercenaries or Occupiers.” Demonstrators voiced frustration over reports that former Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist fighters have reintegrated into local security forces with the tacit approval of Daramsuq (Damascus).

Eyewitnesses report that demonstrators in Tasil, Inkhil, and Jasim chanted against the resurgence of extremist actors in the region, as well as the lack of accountability for Israeli actions. “But the lack of transparency, the civilian casualties, and the increasing aggression suggest a deeper agenda tied to reshaping post-conflict Syria’s southern border reality.”

The call for independent investigations into both the military incursions and the security policies governing Daraa and Quneitra continues to grow, with activists urging the international community to monitor and intervene diplomatically.

As Israel’s operations in Syrian territory persist and civilian protests in Daraa expand, the Syrian government’s ability to guarantee basic security and sovereignty faces renewed scrutiny. The operation saw Israeli troops raid several homes and fire shots indiscriminately, further deepening local fears and aggravating instability, brfore withdrawing from the area.

According to Yasmin Abu Assaf, a local resident of Ain Zaywan, “a military unit entered the village before dawn, raiding three homes and conducting invasive searches.” The reasons behind the operation remain unclear. <image:10566>](https://syriacpress.com/blog/2025/08/28/protesters-in-suwayda-syria-demand-withdrawal-of-syrian-government-forces-israeli-official-says-city-has-effectively-entered-phase-of-secession/ "Protesters in Suwayda, Syria, demand withdrawal of Syrian government forces, Israeli official says city has ‘effectively entered phase of secession’")

[! The Israeli unit later withdrew without making any arrests.

The situation escalated even further when another Israeli force advanced into the neighboring town of Suwaisa, where it opened heavy fire, causing panic among civilians. “The gunfire caused widespread fear, and many families ran for cover, not knowing what was happening.”

As of now, neither the Syrian government nor the United Nations peacekeeping forces stationed in the Golan region have issued statements on this latest incursion. The absence of any official explanation has only added to mounting speculation about Israeli intentions and the broader implications for the region’s fragile stability.

Israeli operations in Quneitra and surrounding areas have escalated in frequency, becoming almost daily events. In some cases, roadblocks were erected, and clashes briefly erupted between protesters and state-aligned militias attempting to disperse the crowds.

“The people of Daraa are caught between two fires—extremism on one side and foreign occupation on the other,” said a local community leader who asked to remain anonymous."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in the Palestinian territory.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel on Tuesday, October 1, in response to the killings of Iran-backed militant leaders, sending Israelis to shelters and prompting alarm across the region.

"A short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran towards the State of Israel," the Israeli military said in a statement, as sirens sounded across Israel. Israeli strikes against Hezbollah targets in several regions of Lebanon on Tuesday killed 55 people and wounded 156, the country's health ministry said.

Lebanon's disaster management agency had said earlier that 1,873 people had been killed since Israel and Hezbollah began trading cross-border fire after the Gaza war erupted on October 7, 2023.

The Israeli ground offensive came despite growing calls for de-escalation after a week of air strikes that killed hundreds in Lebanon, including Hassan Nasrallah, the powerful leader of Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Reports said between 150 and 200 missiles had been fired in the attack.

It was Iran's second on Israel after a missile and drone attack in April in response to a deadly Israeli air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Agence France-Presse (AFP) journalists reported hearing explosions over Jerusalem, while rescuers said two people were lightly injured by shrapnel in central Israel.

Iran's official news agency IRNA said the Islamic Republic had launched "a missile attack on Tel Aviv," Israel's commercial hub. We absolutely need a ceasefire."

"Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hours after the attack, warning,"Whoever attacks us, we attack them."

Israeli airspace was closed with all flights diverted, a spokesman for the airport authority said. but there are things on which we will be coordinating with our Israeli counterparts."

We’d love to hear your thoughts on Le Monde in English! That remains to be seen." Biden said his team had been in contact throughout the attacks with Netanyahu's and that he would be speaking to the Israeli prime minister himself. "I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias," Harris said.

Japan's PM Shigeru Ishiba says the Iran missile attacks on Israel are "unacceptable."

While Iran-backed groups across the region had already been drawn into the Gaza war, sparked by Palestinian group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, Tehran had largely refrained from direct attacks on its regional foe."

Israel has vowed to respond to Iran’s largest ever attack on the country, fueling fears of a further escalation of conflict in the Middle East.

Iran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel on Tuesday in what Tehran said was a response to the [killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/middleeast/hezbollah-nasrallah-killed-israel-strikes-intl/index.html)

 against the Iran-backed group in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. We will act at the time and place we decide,” he said.

CNN teams in Beirut heard blasts overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.

Thick plumes of smoke were visible in the sky above the capital’s southern suburbs, a CNN photo shows.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier said it is striking Hezbollah targets in several southern suburbs of Beirut and more details of the operation would follow.

It also told residents to evacuate several neighborhoods and buildings in the southern suburbs, where it suggested strikes are planned.

In one of a few messages posted to X after midnight local time, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned that residents are located near “dangerous facilities belonging to Hezbollah against which the Defense Force will act with strength shortly.”

Evacuation orders from the Israeli military have been posted on social media between midnight local time and 3 a.m., likely when many people are sleeping.

An estimated 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced over the past couple of weeks, thousands of them sheltering in Beirut, including in schools on the edges of the southern suburbs of the city.

Israeli authorities were picking through pieces of shrapnel to identify the type of missile used in the aftermath of an attack carried out by Iran on Tuesday.

CNN’s Jeremy Diamond, reporting from the site of an attack near a school in the central Israeli town of Gedera, said the impact of the strike left a wall and the windows of a second-grade classroom shattered, with significant damage seen inside.

Workers and heavy machinery could be seen in the background clearing through debris around a large crater measuring around 8 feet at its deepest portion. Shrapnel pieces could also be seen laid out as they were collected for further analysis.

No casualties were reported but hours before the attack, children had been attending the school.

Remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile, including the guidance section and the warhead, were visible in the images and videos taken by CNN at the site of the crater, according to Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army.

He said it was difficult to identify the exact model due to the lack of reference images.

Iranian missile appears to hit less than a kilometer from Mossad headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, on October 1, 2024, in videos verified by CNN.

Social media

Of the approximately 180 missiles the Israel Defense Forces say Iran fired Tuesday night, at least three apparent targets have emerged from a CNN analysis of geolocated videos of the attack.

It’s still too early to tell whether the attack resulted in any serious damage – that will require daylight and likely satellite imagery – but by analyzing the videos from the attack we have a picture of what Iran targeted.

Footage shows a significant concentration of missiles fell either at, or near, the headquarters of Mossad, Nevatim Air Base and Tel Nof Air Base.

Those locations largely tally with what the US intelligence community, and the Israelis, believed would be targeted. The facility, one of Israel’s largest, was previously hit by Iran during its April 13 attack (the IDF said the damage was minimal.)

In the area of the Tel Nof base, more than 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, another video showed a number of impacts.

Jordan has vowed it “will not be a battleground for anyone,” after an Iranian missile attack on Israel ramped up tensions across the Middle East and compounded fears of a wider conflict.

The Ministry of Interior said missile fragments had fallen in different parts of the country including the capital Amman.

Three people sustained minor injuries from falling missiles and debris, according to al-Momani. It also said it was taking “precautionary measures to build and support front-line units on the border fronts to protect the homeland.”

Jordan’s Air Force intercepted Iranian missiles Tuesday, according to a Jordanian official.

The Kingdom was one of the Arab countries that intercepted Iranian drones and missiles that were part of a previous attack against Israel by Iran on April 13.

Amir Cohen/Reuters

Israel operates a range of defensive systems to block attacks by everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.

The country’s **Iron Dome system** has been in the headlines often since regional hostilities ramped up last year in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the system an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.

Meanwhile, the **Arrow 3** uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.

Content: "<image:4532>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:4533>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:4532>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:4535>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv on Thursday, carrying 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in Hamas captivity in Gaza, demanding a deal to secure the remaining hostages’ release. They had been murdered days before Israeli troops reached them, almost 11 months after they’d been kidnapped from Israel during Hamas’s October 7 attack.

News of the hostages’ execution sparked outrage in Israel, and drew charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been refusing to pursue negotiations with Hamas in earnest, avoiding [concessions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/asked-to-decide-between-hostages-or-philadelphi-netanyahu-said-to-prefer-latter/)
 that might have allowed the Israelis to come home alive but would have endangered his ruling coalition.

As protesters in Tel Aviv gathered at Habima Square ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the [six slain hostages](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hersh-carmel-alex-eden-or-almog-the-6-hostages-murdered-by-hamas-just-days-ago/)
, accused Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shouted: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann said, noting the number of days Gat was held captive. (Adar Ayal)

The hostage families and supporters, carrying the caskets, held a mock funeral procession along Begin Street, in the direction of the Begin-Kaplan intersection, in front of the IDF headquarters.

The Tel Aviv thoroughfare has been a locus of demonstrations for a hostage deal and has been blocked by protesters every night since the slain hostages’ bodies were recovered last weekend.

When the 27 coffins arrived at the intersection, the protest began in earnest, swelling to some 2,000 people, who chanted slogans against the government and in favor of a deal.

“We are all hostages of the government of blood!” protesters yelled. <image:4538>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/WhatsApp-Image-2024-09-05-at-21.29.13.jpeg)

Israelis protest in Tel Aviv with photos of murdered hostages, at a demonstration calling for a deal to secure the release of remaining captives held by the Hamas terror group in Gaza, September 5, 2024. Significant crowds also gathered in Rehovot, Eilat and Jerusalem.

It was the fifth straight night of demonstrations, following the [recovery last Saturday](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-recovers-bodies-of-6-hostages-from-gaza-including-one-previously-presumed-alive/)
 of the bodies of six Israeli hostages. On the other side, cardboard planks spelled out: “Here lie our hostages.”

Inside the crowd, a man in Hasidic garb drew attention and applause as he delivered a philippic against Netanyahu.

“Redeeming the hostages is the entire Torah!” he shouted into a megaphone.

Police arrested six people at the demonstration, according to an organization that represents detained protesters. There was no immediate comment from police.

As the protest wound down, police on horseback rebuffed some 100 protesters who attempted to march outside the demonstration area on Begin Street.

Central Tel Aviv police chief Micah Gafni was seen pushing one protester out of the crowd and snatching his megaphone.

A column of officers later marched into the crowd and confiscated a protester’s drum, eliciting sarcastic applause.

Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, protesters gathered near the homes of Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Knesset Member Aryeh Deri, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, as well as in the city’s central Zion Square.

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

[](#) There were 327 opportunities to bring her back."

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

JERUSALEM — Israel's government said a drone targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as fighting with Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Gaza-based Hamas showed no pause after the [killing of the Hamas mastermind](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

**Drone targets Netanyahu’s house while Israeli strikes in Gaza kill more than 50** **Israel said a drone targeted the prime minister’s house; there were no casualties. Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Hezbollah didn't claim responsibility but said it carried out several rocket attacks on Israel. Group of Seven defense ministers warned against escalation and “all-out war.”  

### New exchange of airstrikes

Israel’s military said about 200 projectiles were fired from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

_CNN’s Eyad Kourdi and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting._

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

On Saturday an Israeli drone strike killed two people driving on the highway in Jounieh, a Christian-majority city north of Beirut, marking the first time the city has been hit. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel)) reports that a drone targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on Saturday, October 19, 2024, amid rocket attacks by Hezbollah. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk)) states that the attack was claimed by Hezbollah and occurred on October 22, 2024, causing damage to the house.

The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon)) also reports the drone attack on Netanyahu's house in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, noting superficial damage and no casualties. The Guardian article does not mention Hezbollah claiming responsibility for the attack. <image:4619>, <image:53>, <image:4623>


### Evidence from `image_search`
Haaretz published an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's house ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-01-19/ty-article/.premium/detailed-building-plan-for-netanyahus-seaside-villa-were-available-online/00000185-c4f6-d279-a9b7-ccf770210000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-01-19/ty-article/.premium/detailed-building-plan-for-netanyahus-seaside-villa-were-available-online/00000185-c4f6-d279-a9b7-ccf770210000)). Siasat.com contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's house ([https://www.siasat.com/hezbollah-drone-flies-over-films-netanyahus-residence-report-3080894/](https://www.siasat.com/hezbollah-drone-flies-over-films-netanyahus-residence-report-3080894/)). The Aviationist published an article about an alleged drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house ([https://theaviationist.com/2024/10/19/netanyahus-house-attacked-by-drone/](https://theaviationist.com/2024/10/19/netanyahus-house-attacked-by-drone/)).

The search results include images of Benjamin Netanyahu's house (<image:10644>, <image:10645>, <image:10646>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely of Benjamin Netanyahu's house. The "geolocate" action indicates that Israel is a possible location. The web search confirms that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. The image search also provides images of Netanyahu's house. However, the exact date of the image and whether it was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 cannot be confirmed with the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house is supported by the evidence. However, the claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not confirmed by the evidence. The drone attack occurred in October 2024. Therefore, the claim is partially false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as confirmed by multiple sources ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), [https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk)). However, the claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence, as the drone attack occurred in October 2024.

Content: "(Ayal Margolin/Flash90)

Israel is “ready to support” Lebanon’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah and will implement a phased reduction of its military presence in Lebanon as a “reciprocal measure,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Monday.

If the Lebanese Armed Forces “take the necessary steps to implement the disarmament of Hezbollah, Israel will engage in reciprocal measures, including a phased reduction of IDF presence in coordination with the US-led security mechanism,” the statement reads.

“Israel stands ready to support Lebanon in its efforts to disarm Hezbollah and to work together towards a more secure and stable future for both nations,” it continued.

The comments issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office come nine months after Israel and Lebanon reached a ceasefire deal following a year of cross-border fighting that escalated in September 2024 before the agreement was signed in November. On Monday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem reaffirmed the group’s refusal to disarm.

The Prime Minister’s Office statement praised leaders in Beirut for their “momentous decision,” calling the move “a crucial opportunity for Lebanon to reclaim its sovereignty and restore the authority of its state institutions, military, and governance—free from the influence of non-state actors.”

The statement came a day after top US envoy Tom Barrack, accompanied by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, reportedly met in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials to discuss Syria and Lebanon.

Barrack said in Beirut last week that [Israel should honor its commitments](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoy-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-next-step-as-beirut-agrees-to-disarm-hezbollah/)
 under a November 2024 ceasefire, in light of Beirut’s decision to work toward Hezbollah’s disarmament.

“I think the Lebanese government has done their part. Israel has maintained a military presence in five key points in southern Lebanon and continues to strike Hezbollah targets in the country.

On Monday, alongside the comments from Netanyahu’s office, a Hezbollah operative was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the southern Lebanon town of Tebnine, the military said.

According to the IDF, the operative was involved in restoring Hezbollah military infrastructure in the nearby town of Beit Lif, which the IDF called a violation of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. <image:6710>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250807__692M8AA__v1__HighRes__LebanonIsraelConflictHezbollahArms-1.jpg)

Supporters of Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group block the streets with burning tires as they rally in cars and motorbikes to protest the government’s endorsement of a plan to disarm it, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, early on August 8, 2025. The US also reportedly pressed Israel to consider withdrawing from one of five outposts the IDF has established inside Lebanon.

Under the November 2024 truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon were to be held only by the state, and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops from the country; however, Israel has remained in those five outposts, and Hezbollah has refused to disarm.

In his Monday speech, Qassem said that the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the November ceasefire before talks on a national defense strategy can take place. Sign in to stop seeing this](//crm.timesofisrael.com/sign-in)

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam this month approved the objectives of a US proposal to disarm Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group that is also a political party in Lebanon, by the end of this year. Hezbollah, which was heavily weakened by the war, has vowed to resist such efforts."

Netanyahu says attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon ‘not the end of the story’

This article is more than 1 year old

Israeli air raids on rocket sites are part of dangerous rise in hostilities, increasing fears a major conflict could erupt

Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli air raids targeting Hezbollah rockets in southern Lebanon in the early hours of Sunday morning were “not the end of the story”, after the two sides [exchanged their heaviest fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-hezbollah-attacks-what-we-know-so-far)
 since the war in Gaza began, raising fears of an all-out regional conflict.

The Israeli prime minister did not specify what further action, if any, was planned after the intense exchanges but he suggested Israel’s moves would be aimed at “changing the situation in the north”.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used 100 jet fighters that [hit more than 40 target sites inside Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-pre-emptive-strikes-lebanon-huge-hezbollah-drone-and-rocket-attack)

----------- Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel.

According to Netanyahu, the raids “destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were designed to attack our citizens and our forces in the Galilee” in northern Israel.

He also said the IDF had “intercepted all of the drones that [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 launched at a strategic target in the centre of the country”.

Netanyahu did not name the target but the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, described it as “a military intelligence base 110km inside Israeli territory” just outside Tel Aviv, an apparent reference to the Glilot military base, home to the Mossad spy agency and military intelligence agencies such as the Unit 8200 electronic surveillance section.

Two [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 fighters and a militant from an allied group were killed in the strikes on Lebanon. “And I reiterate – this is not the end of the story.”

Military observers in Israel believe that some IDF generals and the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, are in favour of further sorties against Hezbollah military positions following Sunday’s apparent success.

Gallant told IDF officers that Hezbollah had been thrown off balance by pre-emptive Israeli action minutes before the Lebanese militia was due to launch its rocket and drone attack.

“We have destabilized Hezbollah, and their operation failed,” he said, according to [Haaretz newspaper](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-25/ty-article-live/idf-launches-wave-of-lebanon-strikes-as-israel-braces-for-major-hezbollah-escalation/00000191-8715-d632-add9-b7778aa50000?liveBlogItemId=373173373#373173373)
. He added that all the drones involved had been successfully launched and had entered Israeli airspace, but did not say how many, if any, had reached their intended target.

The Hezbollah secretary general claimed the Lebanese Shia militia had decided not to respond to the [killing in late July of its commander](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says)
, Fuad Shukr, with attacks on Israeli civilians or infrastructure but to focus on exclusively military targets.

He added that Hezbollah’s arsenal of guided missiles had not been used and had not been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, so could be used in the future. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, also stressed his country did not want an all-out conflict, though it would “act according to developments on the ground”.

[Map](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/08/israel_lebanon_strikes-map/giv-13425f8aHmj5xK1D8/)

However, Netanyahu’s government is under persistent political pressure to create conditions in northern Israel for 80,000 displaced residents to return to their homes. They had been driven out by Hezbollah rocket and artillery fire in solidarity with Hamas, after the Palestinian militant group launched its surprise attack on Israel on 7 October last year.

“Nasrallah in Beirut and \[Iranian supreme leader\] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north, and returning our residents securely to their homes,” Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Sunday. He argued that Israel was at a “strategic crossroads” between possible negotiated solutions to the conflict in Gaza and the confrontation with Hezbollah in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

“We need to use the negotiations to bring about the release of hostages, and through the release of the hostages, also open the possibility of creating a resolution in the north, and later, to calm the region,” the defence minister said.

Meanwhile, Israel was “operating militarily and preparing as if we will not reach a resolution, and we are ready at any moment for war in the north, whatever may come”, Gallant said. The French press agency AFP quoted an unnamed US military official as saying that Washington had helped track incoming Hezbollah attacks but “was not involved in Israel’s pre-emptive strikes”.

Gallant’s office reported that the minister had talked by phone to the UK defence secretary, John Healey, to brief him on the pre-emptive airstrikes and the thwarted Hezbollah attack.

“Minister Gallant discussed the important cooperation with Britain in ensuring Israel’s security,” the ministry statement said. An Israeli navy officer was killed and two other service members injured on a patrol boat off the coast of northern Israel that was hit by shrapnel from an Iron Dome interceptor missile.

On Sunday evening the armed wing of Hamas said that it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv in response to what it said was the “Israeli massacres against civilians”.

The IDF said sirens sounded in Rishon LeTsiyon, about 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, but the rocket landed “in an open area”.

A Hamas official also said on Sunday evening that it rejected new Israeli conditions put forward in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 ceasefire talks, casting further doubt on the chances of a breakthrough in the latest US-backed effort."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may deflect responsibility for failing to prevent the Oct. By August 2024, Hezbollah had fired more than 8,000 rockets and 200 UAVs into Israel, damaging hundreds of homes, incinerating about 56 square miles of vegetation and inflicting billions of shekels in economic losses.

The human cost was growing as well. Most damning, as in Gaza, he misled Israelis into believing that “total victory” was possible.

War with Hezbollah was inevitable, given the Sword of Damocles it held over Israel’s head, but, as in the case of Gaza, Netanyahu was risk-averse.

His security doctrine rested on deterrence — managing the threat rather than eliminating it — because an all-out war was expected to bring massive destruction and thousands of civilian casualties. Hoping to avert a wider war, the president convinced Netanyahu to call off the attack (Netanyahu denied the report).

Hezbollah intensified its bombardment with rockets that Iron Dome could not intercept, forcing tens of thousands of Israelis in more than 40 communities along the border to evacuate. 11, which “could have changed the course of the war” and “eliminated all the chain of command of Hezbollah immediately.” However, Netanyahu opted for delay.

Even that success did not end the fighting. By year’s end, Hezbollah had fired 15,400 rockets.

As he would repeatedly, Netanyahu chose placating his right-wing coalition members over working with former President Joe Biden by rejecting a cease-fire proposal the Americans had coordinated with Israel. I said it because I firmly believe that the Lebanese people do not want war and can no longer bear its consequences or even the language of war.”

In August, Lebanon’s government decided to decommission Hezbollah’s weapons and assert full sovereignty over Southern Lebanon for the first time in more than 50 years.

Yet Hezbollah vows to resist."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel published an article in August 2025 discussing Israel's readiness to support Lebanon in disarming Hezbollah, referencing a November 2024 ceasefire deal and ongoing tensions. The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, about attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, quoting Benjamin Netanyahu. The Washington Jewish Week published an article on August 29, 2025, discussing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, mentioning that Hezbollah had fired more than 8,000 rockets and 200 UAVs into Israel by August 2024.

The articles include images of Hezbollah supporters, US envoy Tom Barrack, the conflict, and the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office <image:56>.
The Guardian article is available at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/netanyahu-says-attacks-on-hezbollah-in-lebanon-not-the-end-of-the-story](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/netanyahu-says-attacks-on-hezbollah-in-lebanon-not-the-end-of-the-story).

### Evidence from `image_search`

Content: The Times of Israel published a photo of Benjamin Netanyahu in his office. <image:7796>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024. The Guardian article, published on August 25, 2024, includes the image. The Times of Israel also published an article that includes the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim that Hezbollah captured and published the image cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm Hezbollah's involvement in capturing and publishing the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Truth behind Hezbollah drone photo of Netanyahu revealed
========================================================

Published :  

09-08-2024 10:14|

[MENA](/section/2)

An image surfaced, purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone, shows "Israeli" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office.

The image in question shows Netanyahu seated in what appears to be his office, with the photo seemingly taken through a window from outside the building. 

The accompanying social media caption asserts that "Hezbollah captured this image of the Israeli Prime Minister.”.

However, an investigation by Agence France-Presse (AFP) revealed that the image is not as it seems. 

Search engines and image verification tools have determined that the photo is a composite, created from an older original image published in 2009.

The authentic photo shows Netanyahu with his father at their residence in Jerusalem on February 8, 2009, according to Getty Images. 

The circulating image has been manipulated to give the false impression that it was taken from outside an office building.

His spokesperson said the prime minister was not in the vicinity at the time of the attack and there were no casualties.

Afif said that if in the previous attack Netanyahu was not hurt, “the coming days and nights and the \[battle\]fields are between us.” Afif appeared to be hinting that Hezbollah might carry out similar attempts in the future.

He also said there would be no negotiations with Israel while fighting continues and acknowledged that some Hezbollah fighters have been taken captive by the Israeli military.

“Israel does not adhere to the ethics of war, and we hold it responsible for the safety of our prisoners in its custody,” Afif said.

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel published an article in August 2025 discussing Israel's readiness to support Lebanon in disarming Hezbollah, referencing a November 2024 ceasefire deal and ongoing tensions. The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, about attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, quoting Benjamin Netanyahu. The Washington Jewish Week published an article on August 29, 2025, discussing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, mentioning that Hezbollah had fired more than 8,000 rockets and 200 UAVs into Israel by August 2024.

The articles include images of Hezbollah supporters, US envoy Tom Barrack, the conflict, and the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office <image:56>.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/shortly-after-strike-pms-office-releases-photo-of-netanyahu-at-military-hq/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published a photo of Benjamin Netanyahu in his office. <image:7796>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024. The Guardian article, published on August 25, 2024, includes the image. The Times of Israel also published an article that includes the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim that Hezbollah captured and published the image cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm Hezbollah's involvement in capturing and publishing the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Royanews.tv published an article on August 9, 2024, discussing an image purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone showing Benjamin Netanyahu in his office, stating that the image is a composite created from an older image published in 2009 <image:10656>. Al Jazeera published an article on October 22, 2024, stating that Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday residence <image:7796>.


## Elaboration
The evidence now suggests that Hezbollah was involved with an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Royanews.tv reported that an image, purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone, was a composite created from an older image. This supports the claim that Hezbollah was involved in the image's dissemination.

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building. <image:5685>

[**Iran Takes an Important Step: WhatsApp and Google Play Unblocked, Signaling Progress in Digital Access**](#1anchor)

=======================================================================================================================

**In a significant move toward increased internet freedom, Iranian officials and social media users confirmed the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play on Wednesday, December 25.** The decision, implemented following a directive from the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, aligns with President Masoud Pezeshkian’s campaign promise to reduce censorship and improve digital access for citizens.

**IRNA**, **Iran’s official news agency, announced that access to WhatsApp and Google Play is now unrestricted across all internet providers.** Many users on X confirmed that they could now use the services without a VPN, marking a major shift in digital accessibility. For Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Kurds, and others, the longest night is always followed by the promise of longer, brighter days – a sentiment that resonates deeply during these challenging times.

[**Israel Admits to Killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran**](#4anchor)

==================================================================

**On Monday, December 23, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted Israel’s responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran.** This marks the first official acknowledgment by Israel of its involvement in the killing, which occurred earlier this year.

**Speaking on the matter, Katz declared, “In these times, as the terrorist organization Houthis launch missiles toward Israel, we intend to send them a clear message.”** He continued, “We defeated Hamas, Hezbollah, and blinded Iran’s defensive systems, damaging their missile production facilities.” Katz further warned, “What we did in Gaza, Lebanon, and Tehran, we will also do in Sanaa and Hodeidah, targeting the Houthis’ strategic infrastructure. Iravani emphasized, “This is the first time Israel has openly accepted its responsibility for this heinous crime.” He further described Katz’s statements as an “unprecedented escalation” and called on the international community to condemn Israel’s actions.

**Iranian officials also reiterated their commitment to seeking justice for Haniyeh’s assassination,** framing it as an attack on a prominent figure in the resistance against Israeli aggression and highlighting its implications for regional stability.

[**Ongoing Crackdown on Activists in Iran: Heavy Sentences and Repression**](#5anchor)

=======================================================================================

**The Iranian government continues its systematic repression of activists and dissenters, with harsh sentences handed down to prominent individuals in recent weeks.** These cases highlight the ongoing challenges faced by civil society and the harsh measures employed to silence voices advocating for human rights and freedom within Iran.

**Zeinab Zaman,** **a feminist activist, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined 500 million rials, and barred from social interactions with politically or socially active individuals for five years.** Her lawyer and brother, Abuzar Zaman, revealed that the charges were initially for “propaganda against the regime” but were later changed to “spreading false information.” Zeinab’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when she was summoned to the District 33 Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency later reported that Haniyeh had been targeted by a projectile while staying on the fourth floor of a building in the affluent district of Tehran.

**The Islamic Republic of Iran reacted strongly to Katz’s admission.** Iranian officials characterized the statements as a “brazen confession” and condemned the assassination as a “heinous crime.”

**Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on Tuesday, December 24, denouncing the attack**. However, proponents of the decision argue that these discussions are part of a broader effort to strike a balance between digital governance and public freedom.

**At this current juncture, the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play represents a meaningful stride in enhancing digital access in Iran.** It sets a hopeful precedent for further advancements in internet freedom that are still deeply needed in tandem with careful, inclusive policy-making. 

[**Iran and China: A Strategic Partnership and Challenges Ahead**](#2anchor)

=============================================================================

**Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has traveled to Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials.** Upon his arrival, Araghchi remarked to IRIB News that Iran’s nuclear file will require intensified consultations with China as the expiration of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement approaches in October 2025.

**During his visit, Araghchi published an article in** **_People’s Daily_****, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, expressing optimism for a “new chapter” in Iran-China relations.** In his article, Araghchi emphasized the mutual stance of both nations against “unilateralism and hegemonic practices” and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy approach. Despite these efforts, the bravery and resilience of activists like Zeinab Zaman and Majid Tavakoli remain symbols of defiance in the face of repression.

[**Italian Journalist Cecilia Sala Detained in Tehran**](#6anchor)

===================================================================

**The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the detention of Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old journalist, in Tehran.** Sala, known for her work with the Italian newspaper _Il Foglio_ and her popular podcast at Cora Media, was detained on December 19, 2024, during a reporting trip in Iran.

**According to the ministry’s statement on December 27, Sala was stopped and arrested by Iranian authorities while working on a series of stories.** She is currently held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, a facility notorious for housing political prisoners and journalists. They have called on the press to advocate for her freedom.

**Sala is not the first journalist to face detention in Iran for reporting.** Over the years, several foreign and dual-national reporters, including Roxana Saberi, Jason Rezaian, Roger Cooper, and Maziar Bahari, have been arrested, highlighting the precarious conditions for journalists in the country.

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to the Tehran Times, Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024. The article also mentions that Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has been criticized for allegedly facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign. ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)) <image:k>

An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:5685> The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024. ([https://niacouncil.org/12-27-24/](https://niacouncil.org/12-27-24/)) <image:5697>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024, as stated by his son, according to the Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). Additionally, there are unconfirmed reports that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)).

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the bne Gulf bureau article mentions the possibility of WhatsApp being used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware, which is an unconfirmed report.

To verify the claim, more information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

([https://niacouncil.org/12-27-24/](https://niacouncil.org/12-27-24/)) <image:5697>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024, as stated by his son, according to the Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). Additionally, there are unconfirmed reports that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)).

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the bne Gulf bureau article mentions the possibility of WhatsApp being used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware, which is an unconfirmed report.

To verify the claim, more information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported on June 17, 2025, that an IRGC-affiliated media report claimed Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran using mobile tracking ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)). Modern Diplomacy, in an article published on August 4, 2024, suggests that Israeli intelligence may have used spyware, potentially like Pegasus, to track Haniyeh's location and intercept communications via WhatsApp ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/)). <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional insights. The Jerusalem Post cites an IRGC-affiliated media report claiming Israel used mobile tracking to kill Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

While the evidence doesn't definitively confirm the claim, it strengthens the possibility that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The Modern Diplomacy article specifically mentions the potential use of spyware to intercept communications on WhatsApp.

The claim is likely true, but further verification would require confirmation from independent sources.

Content: "When Israel’s intelligence detects a larger collection of phones than usual in a particular area, it can conclude that there’s an unusual event — like a Hezbollah meeting, for example — and deploy missiles, he added.

Has Israel issued such warnings before?
---------------------------------------

During the current war, Israel has so far dropped pamphlets to alert Lebanese border communities of an impending bombing campaign.

But it has in the past also been accused of hacking Lebanese telecommunications networks.

In 2018, Amal Mudallali, Lebanon’s permanent representative to the United Nations, [accused](https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n18/437/18/pdf/n1843718.pdf)
 Israel of hacking mobile lines and sending recorded messages to civilians in Kafr Kila village, warning them of imminent explosions amid [tensions](/features/2018/12/22/lebanons-border-tense-as-israel-excavates-hezbollah-tunnels)
 between Hezbollah and Israel that year.

“This constitutes a new and extremely serious attack on the security and safety of the citizens of Lebanon, whereby Israel is violating the dignity and privacy of individuals and making a direct threat against their lives,” Mudallali wrote in a letter to the UN Security Council, asking for condemnation of Israel’s “hostile” behaviour.

Israel is also known for its [strong](/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-pagers-explode-has-israel-carried-out-such-attacks-before)
 capabilities in breaking into electronic devices using malware.

Pegasus, one type of such malware, was developed by the Israeli company NSO Group and has been used by multiple countries [to spy](/news/2022/2/8/what-you-need-to-know-about-israeli-spyware-pegasus)
 on their citizens, according to a 2021 investigation by Amnesty International, Forbidden Stories and a host of media houses.

Illegal data gathering in Lebanon likely dates back to 2007, when Mossad spy networks’ focus on communications systems were first uncovered in Lebanon, Magnier said. While Israel didn’t claim responsibility, most experts concluded it was behind those explosions.

While experts believe Israel planted explosives in those devices months before they were detonated, the ability to send targeted warnings to individuals in specific parts of Lebanon suggests that Israel has access to real-time information about Lebanese civilians — not just its supposed enemies in Hezbollah.

That’s not surprising, said Elijah Magnier, a risk and conflict analyst.

Magnier, who closely watches Israel’s conflicts in the Middle East, told Al Jazeera that Israel had hacked Lebanese networks way before October 8.

“They have access to landlines, car plate numbers, mobile phones — to the point that they are able to communicate to anyone in the south of Lebanon exactly as they are able to do in the West Bank or Gaza,” he said.

Sophisticated spyware technology and equipment means that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency can map exactly who lives where, what phone numbers they have and who frequents their homes, Magnier said.

Spies, he added, can collect thousands of IP addresses in towns and cities just by driving on the streets with their equipment. 7 Hamas attack,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli academic, wrote in the publication New Lines Magazine.

Is Lebanon’s data privacy framework weak?
-----------------------------------------

As powerful as Israel’s technological capabilities are, weaknesses in Lebanon’s data security structures haven’t helped its citizens either, experts and privacy rights groups say.

At times, Lebanese state actors have themselves contributed to data breaches.

Lebanese embassies reportedly exposed the personal data of thousands of Lebanese citizens in the diaspora who had registered to vote in the run-up to the 2018 general election, [according](https://privacyinternational.org/state-privacy/1081/state-privacy-lebanon)
 to the monitoring website Privacy International.

In the same year, the Lebanese security intelligence agency was found to have run several hacking campaigns since 2012, stealing thousands of gigabytes of data from users of messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to researchers from the mobile security firm Look Up and the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. While the 1999 Telecommunications Act protects people against surveillance and tapping (except in criminal investigations), a 2013 directive also requires internet service providers, cafes and other internet-enabled stores to keep user data for at least a year.

This month, Lebanese publications reported increasing cases of attempted WhatsApp hacking, with people receiving messages to click on suspicious codes and links and then receiving alerts that their WhatsApp had been opened on another device. Commenters on the social platform Reddit also reported the same.

According to information [posted](https://faq.whatsapp.com/479314433984258)
 on WhatsApp’s frequently asked questions page (FAQs), the application sends a verification code to users when someone is trying to register another WhatsApp account with the same numbers.

“When you receive this notification, it means that someone has entered your phone number and requested the registration code,” WhatsApp says."

The article also mentions that the Lebanese security intelligence agency was found to have run several hacking campaigns since 2012, stealing data from messaging apps like WhatsApp. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel possesses the capability to hack electronic devices using malware, including Pegasus ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/get-away-from-hezbollah-has-israel-hacked-lebanons-telecoms-networks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/get-away-from-hezbollah-has-israel-hacked-lebanons-telecoms-networks)). This, combined with previous evidence suggesting the potential use of spyware to track Haniyeh's location and intercept communications via WhatsApp, strengthens the likelihood that Israeli intelligence could have used such methods.

The claim is likely true, given the evidence of Israel's capabilities and the reports of potential spyware use.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence may have tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp, potentially using spyware. While there is no definitive proof, reports from multiple sources, including Modern Diplomacy and The Jerusalem Post, indicate the possibility. Given Israel's known capabilities in hacking electronic devices and the reports of potential spyware use, the claim is likely true. `true`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is likely true. Evidence from sources like the Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)) and Modern Diplomacy ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/)) suggest that Haniyeh used WhatsApp and that Israeli intelligence may have used spyware, like Pegasus, to track his location and intercept communications. Furthermore, Al Jazeera reports that Israel is known for its capabilities in breaking into electronic devices using malware, including Pegasus.

Vote on a Draft Resolution on the War in Gaza\*
===============================================

Tomorrow morning (20 November), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
, which was put forward by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. The remaining 14 members voted in favour.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

The United Nations Security Council has failed to pass a United States draft resolution calling for, but not demanding, a ceasefire in [Israel’s continuing war on Gaza](/tag/israel-palestine-conflict/)
 after two permanent members chose to veto it.

The draft put before the Council on Friday received 11 votes in favour, three against – from Russia, China and Algeria – and one abstention by Guyana.

Russia and China both exercised their veto against the resolution, which would have spoken of the “imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire” and condemned the [October 7](/news/2024/3/21/october-7-forensic-analysis-shows-hamas-abuses-many-false-israeli-claims)
 attack by Hamas.

Moscow accused Washington of a “hypocritical spectacle” that does not pressure Israel.

Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said the draft was exceedingly politicised and contained an “effective green light” for Israel to mount a military operation in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering.

Nebenzia said there was no call for a ceasefire in the resolution’s text and accused the US leadership of “deliberately misleading the international community”.

China’s representative, Zhang Jun, said the draft “dodged the most central issue, that of a ceasefire” through its “ambiguous” language.

“Nor does it even provide an answer to the question of realising a ceasefire in the short term,” he added.

No ‘demand’ for ceasefire
-------------------------

While the US promoted the measure as calling for a ceasefire, critics pointed out that the draft falls short of demanding an end to the war.

The proposal backs the “imperative” for “an immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians on all sides”, differing from previous draft resolutions vetoed by Washington, which demanded an unconditional ceasefire.

The US draft resolution also ties the ceasefire to the ongoing talks to secure a truce deal that would see the release of Israeli captives in Gaza.

“It says it’s important that there is a ceasefire; it doesn’t seem to be demanding one,” Al Jazeera’s diplomatic correspondent James Bays, who had obtained a copy of the draft resolution, said earlier this week.

“And it’s also linking this ceasefire directly with the release of the remaining captives being held by Hamas and other groups in Gaza.”

After Friday’s vote, US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Russia had prioritised politics over progress by using its veto, adding that both Russia and China were doing nothing meaningful to advance peace.

Alternative draft resolutions
-----------------------------

The US, Israel’s closest ally, has vetoed three resolutions demanding a ceasefire, the most recent being an Arab-backed measure supported by 13 council members with one abstention on February 20.

A day earlier, the US had circulated a rival resolution, which went through major changes during negotiations before this Friday’s vote.

It initially would have supported a temporary ceasefire linked to the release of all hostages, and the previous draft would have supported international efforts for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal.

On Friday, Algeria’s UN ambassador, Amar Bendjama, said that had the Council passed its February resolution, thousands of innocent lives could have been saved. More than 32,000 Palestinians – mostly women and children – have been killed since the war began last October.

These figures represent lives and “hopes that have been destroyed”, Bendjama said, adding that the US text made no mention of Israel’s responsibility for their deaths.

Speaking to reporters later in the day, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said there was “nothing new” in the US draft resolution, stressing that it expressed Washington’s long standing position of backing a temporary ceasefire in Gaza as part of a hostage deal.

Kirby accused Russia and China of rejecting the proposal “simply” for being authored in the US.

Meanwhile, the 10 elected members of the Security Council have been drafting their own resolution, which demands that an immediate humanitarian ceasefire for the holy month of [Ramadan](/podcasts/2024/3/11/the-take-observing-ramadan-against-the-backdrop-of-war)
, which began March 10, be “respected by all parties leading to a permanent sustainable ceasefire”.

It also demands “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages ” and emphasises the urgent need to protect civilians and deliver [humanitarian aid](/features/longform/2024/3/21/a-jordanian-flight-across-israel-an-airdrop-over-gazas-ruins)
 throughout the Gaza Strip.

France will also work on a new UN resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.

“Following Russia’s and China’s veto a few minutes ago, we are going to resume work on the basis of the French draft resolution in the Security Council and work with our American, European and Arab partners to reach an agreement,” Macron said at the end of a European Union leaders summit in Brussels.
