## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image in the claim is from the September 2023 issue of Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games held between September 23 to October 8, 2023. The article from [Source](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/china-has-not-chosen-a-design-inspired-by-the-palestinian-flag-for-the-paris-olympics-2024/) is labeled as "Misleading". The image does not show Chinaâ€™s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games. The Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games will be held from July 26 to August 11, 2024.

The article from [Source](https://factly.in/an-old-photo-from-vogue-china-magazine-is-being-falsely-shared-as-showing-chinese-athletes-wearing-the-colours-of-the-palestinian-flag/) also mentions that the photo was taken for the Hangzhou Asian Games. ![image 8577](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511871-131581.jpg), ![image 8578](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511871-592812.jpg), ![image 8579](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511872-953621.jpg), ![image 8580](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511876-462170.jpg), ![image 8581](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511878-921272.jpg), ![image 8602](media/2025-08-29_23-58-1756511908-319624.jpg), ![image 8596](media/2025-08-29_23-58-1756511893-685454.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is misleading. The image is from the September 2023 issue of Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics. The colors in the image are similar to the Palestinian flag, but the image's context is unrelated to the Olympics.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false because the image is from Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics. The image is being misrepresented in a new context. `false`
