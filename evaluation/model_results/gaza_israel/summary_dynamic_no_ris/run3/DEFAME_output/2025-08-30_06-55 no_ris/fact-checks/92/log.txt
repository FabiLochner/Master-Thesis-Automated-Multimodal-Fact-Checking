Content: Reuters published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby saved from the rubble in Gaza after the mother was killed in an Israeli strike. <image:10858>

Content: Newsweek published an article about a child rescued from the rubble in Gaza. <image:10859>

The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image likely depicts a Palestinian child under rubble in Gaza, as confirmed by the geolocation and search results. The evidence indicates that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, and there have been rescue efforts. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but lacks specific date verification.

So, the overall veracity is: false
