Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218): 
Content: The Anadolu Agency published an article on June 26, 2025, discussing the financial impact of the war between Israel and Iran. <image:k> The article mentions that the US was directly involved in the conflict, with strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. The US operation involved 125 military aircraft and cost between $1 billion to $2 billion. The article also mentions that Israel's military expenditure soared, with the cost of operating missile defense systems costing up to $285 million per day. The cumulative impact of missile damage, reconstruction, and compensations could inflate Israel’s financial burden to double-digit billions.

The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. Evidence indicates an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump, which also targeted two Jewish Americans, but there's no evidence linking Israel to the plot. Furthermore, the U.S. is providing financial and military support to Israel in the Israel-Iran war, as documented by sources like the [PBS article](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-the-u-s-militarys-intervention-in-the-israel-iran-war) and the [Anadolu Agency article](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218).

So, the overall veracity is: false
