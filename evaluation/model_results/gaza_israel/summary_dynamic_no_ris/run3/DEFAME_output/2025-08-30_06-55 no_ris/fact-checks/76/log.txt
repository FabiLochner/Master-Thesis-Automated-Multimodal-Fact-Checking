The claim '<image:47> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic social media post from Mel Gibson saying that Israel will end soon and therefore destroy everything in its way together with a flag in the color of Israel that shows an hourglass.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
