The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which was about the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters," was altered to falsely depict a question about soldiers and rape, as confirmed by multiple sources ([Source](https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/), [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/), and [Source](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza)).
