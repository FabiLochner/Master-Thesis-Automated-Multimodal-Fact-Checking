The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a man in an orange jacket in rubble, likely from the Turkey earthquake, as indicated by geolocation data and image search results, which contradicts the claim that it shows a man from Gaza.
