Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/plante-served-over-pro-palestinian-electronic-signs/article_e0143fdc-d532-5ecf-9a66-095ad0ee8ab9.html): 
Content: The Suburban published an article stating that Mayor Valérie Plante was served by bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists. The signs displayed messages such as "Free Palestine. Valérie Plante needs to take concrete action." <image:956> The article mentions that the signs were claimed by a group called Clash MTL. The article also includes an image of a sign that says "INTIFADA NOW". <image:956> The article was written by Joel Goldenberg.

Useful result: From [Source](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/four-arrested-after-protesters-attacked-concordia-threw-molotov-cocktails-at-police): 
Content: The Montreal Gazette reports on a pro-Palestinian protest in Montreal on September 30, 2024, where demonstrators vandalized Concordia University and luxury stores. Mayor Valérie Plante described the protest as "unacceptable." <image:13> The article mentions the SPVM making arrests. The article was published on September 30, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/plante-anti-nato-protest-1.7392719): 
Content: CBC News published an article on November 25, 2024, about an anti-NATO protest in Montreal. The article mentions Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemning the actions of protesters. <image:1>. The protest was organized by the Divest for Palestine collective and anti-capitalist group CLAC.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is misleading.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message. However, the sign was hacked and the city considered it an act of vandalism, not authorized by Mayor Valérie Plante, who condemned the action, as reported by the [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809) and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
