The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. The image in question, <image:65>, is likely AI-generated or digitally altered, as indicated by the "IN VISUAL ART" watermark and a fact-check article that debunks the image as AI-generated. The claim misrepresents the image as an authentic depiction of an attack.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
