## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.N. Security Council authorized continued reporting on attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region, as reported by [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/council-authorizes-continuing-vigilance-attacks-yemens-houthi-rebels-123789548). The attacks are described as an effort to end Israel’s offensive against Hamas in Gaza. ![image 841](media/2025-07-20_09-57-1753005470-058256.jpg), ![image 842](media/2025-07-20_09-57-1753005470-356594.jpg)

An international military operation, Operation Prosperity Guardian, began on December 18, 2023, to protect Red Sea shipping, involving the United States Navy, Royal Navy, and other countries, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Prosperity_Guardian). The article mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire, where the Houthis ceased attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but would continue targeting Israel and Israeli-linked vessels. On May 6, 2025, President Donald Trump announced that the Houthis had "capitulated" and promised not to attack commercial vessels. The U.N. extended monitoring of Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, as reported by [Safety4Sea](https://safety4sea.com/u-n-extends-monitoring-of-houthi-attacks-in-the-red-sea/), with demands for the cessation of Houthi attacks against vessels and the release of detained crew members.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Fox News reports that Trump halted military strikes on Houthis, but the Houthis violated their pledge to stop attacks in the Red Sea (![image 856](media/2025-07-20_10-00-1753005628-255199.jpg), ![image 855](media/2025-07-20_10-00-1753005627-008725.jpg), ![image 857](media/2025-07-20_10-00-1753005629-347982.jpg), ![image 884](media/2025-07-20_10-00-1753005647-108572.jpg), ![image 885](media/2025-07-20_10-00-1753005647-302721.jpg)). The Atlantic Council discusses the challenges of the US strategy towards the Houthis in Yemen, mentioning the Trump administration escalating US military strikes against the rebel force over their attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea.

In May, Trump announced that the Houthis "just don't want to fight…and we will honor that. We will stop the bombings." The articles do not mention the final cessation of military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis pledged to cease attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea in 2025, during Trump's presidency, but later violated this pledge. While Trump announced the end of bombings, the evidence does not support the claim that the Houthis announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. The evidence suggests that the Houthis continued targeting Israeli and Israeli-linked vessels.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 election. While there was a temporary cessation of attacks on commercial shipping, it was later violated. The claim misrepresents the situation. `misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While there was a 2025 ceasefire where the Houthis ceased attacks on commercial shipping, they continued targeting Israeli vessels, and later violated their pledge, as reported by [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/). The evidence does not support the claim that the Houthis announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.
