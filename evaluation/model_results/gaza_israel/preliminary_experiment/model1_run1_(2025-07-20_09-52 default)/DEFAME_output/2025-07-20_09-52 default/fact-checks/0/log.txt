Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg): Found exact image on website with title: File:Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg
Content: The image is from Wikimedia Commons and is titled "Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg". The image shows two soldiers in Babil Province Iraq in 2007. The image was uploaded on June 21, 2011, and is in the public domain. <image:1>

The claim '<image:1> This image shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the U.S. Army, which has died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim is a photograph of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, taken in 2007, as evidenced by the [Wikimedia Commons entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg). The claim incorrectly identifies the individuals and the location, making it misleading.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
