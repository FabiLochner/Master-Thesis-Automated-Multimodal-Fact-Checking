No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The provided image shows a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that has been damaged, with a pickaxe lying nearby.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized with a pickax, and the star was placed in 2007. ([https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2018/07/25/trumps-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-vandalized/11314069007/](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2018/07/25/trumps-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-vandalized/11314069007/)) The Jerusalem Post reported that Gal Gadot's star was vandalized, including a photograph of the vandalized star. ([https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-855930](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-855930))

FOX 11 reported that Gal Gadot's star was vandalized with the words "baby killer" and a sticker that read "Israeli snipers target children." ([https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized](https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized)) The article states that Gadot received the star in March of the same year. The American Jewish Committee posted a photo of the vandalized star online. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 966](media/2025-07-20_10-05-1753005945-688940.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. The image search results show a picture of the damaged star, which matches the image in the claim. The web search results from FOX 11 and The Jerusalem Post confirm the vandalism and provide additional details, including the words "baby killer" and a sticker. The evidence also indicates that Gadot received her star in March of the same year.

The claim is partially accurate. The image does show a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the evidence confirms that it was Gal Gadot's star. However, the claim that the vandalism occurred in March 2025 is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim shows a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is confirmed to be Gal Gadot's star. However, the claim that the vandalism occurred in March 2025 is not supported by the evidence.

`misleading`
