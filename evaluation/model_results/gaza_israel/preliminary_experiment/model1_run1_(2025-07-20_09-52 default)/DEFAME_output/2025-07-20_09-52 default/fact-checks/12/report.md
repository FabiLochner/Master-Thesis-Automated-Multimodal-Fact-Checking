## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The court found Israel's continued presence in the territory unlawful, by a vote of 11 to 4, and obligated Israel to end its presence as quickly as possible. The UN Secretary-General's report on this opinion was published on December 19, 2024.

The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The article mentions a UN General Assembly resolution that gave effect to the ICJ's opinion. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law. ![image 756](media/2025-07-18_21-40-1752874842-948189.jpg)

## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, stating that Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. The ICJ did not declare Israel an "illegal state," but rather found its presence in the territory to be unlawful.

The evidence supports the claim that the ICJ issued a ruling in July 2024 regarding Israel's actions. However, the claim misrepresents the nature of the ruling. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but found its presence in the occupied territory unlawful.


## Final Judgement
The claim is misleading because it misrepresents the ICJ's ruling. While the ICJ did rule on Israel's actions in July 2024, it did not declare Israel an illegal state. Instead, it found Israel's presence in the occupied territory unlawful. `misleading`
