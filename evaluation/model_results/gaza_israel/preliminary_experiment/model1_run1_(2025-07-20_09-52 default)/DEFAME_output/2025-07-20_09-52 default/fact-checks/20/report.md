## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press fact-checked the claim that $50 million was designated for condoms in Gaza, stating there is no evidence to support it. The article mentions a USAID grant to the International Medical Corps (IMC) for medical services, including contraceptives, but the IMC stated no US government funding was used for condoms. The White House announced that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza," with the White House press secretary calling it a waste of taxpayer money. The Washington Post reported that the White House claimed $50 million in aid for Gaza was suspended, including family planning programs.

## Elaboration
The Associated Press fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support that $50 million was designated for condoms in Gaza ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)). The White House stated that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza" ([https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt)). The Washington Post reported that the White House claimed $50 million in aid for Gaza was suspended, including family planning programs ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/)).

The evidence suggests a discrepancy. While the White House claimed the funds were for condoms, the AP fact-check found no evidence to support this. The claim is therefore partially supported, as the White House did halt a payment, but the specific allocation of funds to condoms is disputed.

The claim's veracity is uncertain due to conflicting information.


## Final Judgement
The claim is misleading because it presents a specific detail (funding for condoms) that is not fully supported by the evidence. While the White House did halt a payment, the direct allocation of funds to condoms is disputed. `misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While the White House stated that a $50 million payment was halted, the Associated Press fact-check found no evidence that the funds were specifically designated for condoms in Gaza ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)).
