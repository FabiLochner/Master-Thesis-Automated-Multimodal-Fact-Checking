## Elaboration
The claim is partially verifiable. The image does show the President of FC Barcelona, Joan Laporta, with representatives holding an Israeli flag. However, the evidence indicates this event occurred in February 2023, not September 2024. The evidence also does not explicitly state whether the Gaza war was ongoing at the time of the meeting.



## Final Judgement
The image is of FC Barcelona's president with Israeli representatives holding an Israeli flag. The event occurred in February 2023, not September 2024, as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is misleading because it misrepresents the date of the event.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image depicts FC Barcelona's president with Israeli representatives holding an Israeli flag, which occurred in February 2023, not September 2024 as the claim suggests. Therefore, the claim is misleading due to the incorrect date.
