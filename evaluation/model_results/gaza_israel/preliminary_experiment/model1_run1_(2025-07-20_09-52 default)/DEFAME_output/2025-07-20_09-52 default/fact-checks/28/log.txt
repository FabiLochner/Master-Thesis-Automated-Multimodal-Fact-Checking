Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/african-union-israel-ambassador-evicted-rwanda-genocide-f22033810dc019bd632deed7bb9fab25): 
Content: The Associated Press reports that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia was ejected from an African Union event this week. The ejection was at the request of AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Youssouf. The ambassador, Avraham Nigusse, asserted on social media that the chairperson chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements. The article was published on July 11, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia Avraham Neguise was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa. Neguise has served as ambassador to Ethiopia since August 2024. <image:1050>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting): 
Content: The Tasnim News Agency published an article on April 7, 2025, reporting that the Israeli ambassador was removed from an African Union meeting. <image:1051> The article mentions that the removal occurred during a session focused on the Rwandan genocide and that the ambassador's presence was objected to by several African countries.

The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is misleading.
Justification: The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union event in April 2025, as reported by the [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting). However, the evidence indicates that the removal was at the request of the AU Commission Chairperson and objected to by several African countries, not an expulsion by Ethiopia.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
