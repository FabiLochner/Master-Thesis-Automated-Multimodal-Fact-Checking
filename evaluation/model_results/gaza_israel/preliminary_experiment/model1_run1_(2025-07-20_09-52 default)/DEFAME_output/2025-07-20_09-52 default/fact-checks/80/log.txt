Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article on September 5, 2024, about a protest in Tel Aviv. <image:49> shows mock coffins used by protesters demanding a deal to free hostages in Gaza. The article mentions 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas, and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir. <image:2228> shows Israelis mourning the return of the bodies. The article mentions that the hostages were seized on October 7, 2023. <image:2227> shows a Red Cross vehicle.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on September 5, 2024, reports on a protest in Tel Aviv where demonstrators carried makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. <image:49> The protesters are angry with the Israeli government.

The claim '<image:49> This image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September, 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, as reported by [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/) and [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages), to symbolize hostages held in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
