## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, a global tech outage caused by a software update from CrowdStrike impacted airlines and airports, leading to flight cancellations and delays. The Times of Israel reported that Ben Gurion Airport was expected to be affected. Reuters also reported on the global tech outage affecting airlines and airports.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that on July 19, 2024, a global tech outage affected airlines and airports, including Ben Gurion Airport. This could have caused delays and congestion. However, there is no information to confirm that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts a crowded airport, and while there was a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024, and a global tech outage affecting airports on the same day, there is no evidence to confirm that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack. `not enough information`

### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While a Houthi attack and a global tech outage affecting airports occurred on July 19, 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The image search results show crowded airports in Israel, but do not link the image to the specific event.
