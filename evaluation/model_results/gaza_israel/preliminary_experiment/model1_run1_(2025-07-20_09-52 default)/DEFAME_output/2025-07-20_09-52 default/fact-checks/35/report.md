### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader)) and The Washington Post ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/)) both report that an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024, killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite)) also discusses the airstrikes.

## Elaboration
The image (![image 24](media/35.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image shows the ring of Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Damascus, not Hassan Nasrallah. The claim also incorrectly states the date and location of the event.

`misleading`
