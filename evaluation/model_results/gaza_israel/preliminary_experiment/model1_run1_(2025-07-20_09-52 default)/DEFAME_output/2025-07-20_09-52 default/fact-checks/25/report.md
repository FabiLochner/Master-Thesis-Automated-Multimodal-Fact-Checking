## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Keir Starmer stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024. While the evidence indicates that Starmer has expressed concerns about the situation in Gaza, called for a ceasefire, and is facing calls for stronger action, including sanctions, there is no mention of a complete diplomatic boycott.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Keir Starmer has commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including calls for a ceasefire and considering further actions, but there is no evidence of him stating the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

`false`
