## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from jpost.com discussing technological lessons learned from the Iran war, published on July 20, 2025 (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). Another source, a Wikipedia article, mentions that Iran launched over 120 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, 2024, and Israel's defensive efforts destroyed 99 percent of the incoming weapons.

A report from JINSA, published on December 6, 2024, states that Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, resulting in minimal damage. The report estimates the cost of the attack to Iran at $2.3 billion.

## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information regarding the interception rate of ballistic missiles. The Wikipedia article states that 99% of the incoming weapons were destroyed, while the jpost.com article does not specify an interception rate. Therefore, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News Hour reported that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90% during the Iranian missile strike on October 2, 2024, when Iran fired over 180 missiles at Israel. The Associated Press published an article discussing the Iranian missile strikes on Israel, with images of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles. The article mentions that the Iron Dome is not foolproof and that interception rates are generally high, but enemy missiles can penetrate. The article was published on June 19, 2025.

## Elaboration
The PBS News Hour article states that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% during the Iranian missile strike on October 2, 2024. This supports the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles. However, the Associated Press article mentions that the Iron Dome is not foolproof, and enemy missiles can penetrate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from PBS News Hour supports the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted over 90% of the missiles during the Iranian missile strike on October 2, 2024. The Associated Press article also supports the claim, but it also mentions that the Iron Dome is not foolproof.

`true`

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
The claim is supported by evidence from a PBS News Hour article, which states that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% during the Iranian missile strike on October 2, 2024. An Associated Press article also supports the claim, although it notes that the Iron Dome is not foolproof.
