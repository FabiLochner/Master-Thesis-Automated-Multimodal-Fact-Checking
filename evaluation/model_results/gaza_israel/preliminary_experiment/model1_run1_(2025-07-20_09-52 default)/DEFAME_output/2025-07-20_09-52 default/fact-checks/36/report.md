### Evidence from `web_search`
PesaCheck fact-checked a claim that Yoav Gallant was killed in the October 1, 2024 Iranian attack on Israel and found it to be false, stating that Gallant met with Israeli military officers on October 4, 2024 (<image:k>). An NPR article from November 5, 2024, reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (![image 1377](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007113-580397.jpg), ![image 1378](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007113-709368.jpg), ![image 1379](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007114-670145.jpg), ![image 1380](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007116-909576.jpg)).

Gallant resigned from the Knesset on January 5, 2025.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, as reported by Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)). The attack was in response to Israeli actions, and Israel, with its allies, intercepted most of the missiles <image:k>. The NPR article also mentions the killing of Hezbollah's leader ![image 1381](media/2025-07-20_10-26-1753007205-209336.jpg), ![image 1382](media/2025-07-20_10-26-1753007207-358310.jpg), ![image 1383](media/2025-07-20_10-26-1753007207-687521.jpg), ![image 1384](media/2025-07-20_10-26-1753007207-812187.jpg), ![image 1386](media/2025-07-20_10-26-1753007210-012130.jpg).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and Critical Threats Project (CTP) also reported on the attack ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)). The ISW report does not mention Yoav Gallant.


## Elaboration
The claim that Yoav Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is false. PesaCheck fact-checked the claim and found it to be untrue. Furthermore, evidence indicates that Gallant met with Israeli military officers on October 4, 2024.

The evidence also shows that Gallant was fired as Defense Minister by Prime Minister Netanyahu on November 5, 2024, and resigned from the Knesset on January 5, 2025.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Yoav Gallant was not killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, and was alive and active in the following months. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including a PesaCheck fact-check, confirms that Yoav Gallant was not killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. Furthermore, he was active after the attack, meeting with military officers on October 4, 2024, and later being fired as Defense Minister in November 2024.
