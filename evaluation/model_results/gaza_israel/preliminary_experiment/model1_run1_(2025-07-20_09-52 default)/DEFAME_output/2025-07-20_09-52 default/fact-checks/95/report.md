## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows a father, Mesut Hancer, holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. The earthquake occurred in February 2023.

The image was published by The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)), SBS News ([https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl)). ![image 62](media/95.jpg), ![image 2593](media/2025-07-20_11-14-1753010065-006939.jpg), ![image 2599](media/2025-07-20_11-14-1753010067-105265.jpg), ![image 2601](media/2025-07-20_11-14-1753010073-859878.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023, not a bombing in Gaza in July 2024. The evidence includes links to news articles from The Independent, SBS News, and CNN.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a father in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in February 2023, not a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin, content, and meaning of the image.
