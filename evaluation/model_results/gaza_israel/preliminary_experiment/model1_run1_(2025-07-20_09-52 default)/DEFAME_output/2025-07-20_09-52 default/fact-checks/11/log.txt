Content: The Associated Press (AP) published an article stating that a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, October 13, without mentioning the name of the chief of the IDF, Herzi Halevi. <image:i>

The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack occurred on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, reports from The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) debunked rumors of Herzi Halevi's death. Additionally, The Times of Israel reported on government criticism of Halevi without mentioning his assassination ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/)).
