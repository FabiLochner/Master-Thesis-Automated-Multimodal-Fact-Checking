Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-urged-aid-yemen-anti-112626822.html): 
Content: Fox News reports that Trump halted military strikes on Houthis.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/can-donald-trump-completely-annihilate-the-houthis-in-yemen/): 
Content: The Atlantic Council discusses the challenges of the US strategy towards the Houthis in Yemen. The article mentions that the Trump administration is escalating US military strikes against the rebel force over their attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea. It also mentions that the US is working to cut off Iranian shipments to the Houthis. The article does not mention the cessation of military operations in international waters.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-urged-aid-yemens-anti-houthi-forces-terror-group-escalates-attacks-shipping): 
Content: Fox News reports that in May, Trump announced that the Houthis "just don't want to fight…and we will honor that. We will stop the bombings." However, the Houthi terrorists appear to have violated their pledge to Trump to stop attacks in the Red Sea. <image:884>, <image:885>. The article also mentions that Israel exchanged missile fire with Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on Monday, targeting the group's ports and other facilities.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there was a 2025 ceasefire where the Houthis ceased attacks on commercial shipping, they continued targeting Israeli vessels, and later violated their pledge, as reported by [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/). The evidence does not support the claim that the Houthis announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
