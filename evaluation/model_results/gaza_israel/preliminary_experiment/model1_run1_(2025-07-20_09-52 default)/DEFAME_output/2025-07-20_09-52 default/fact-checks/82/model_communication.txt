"There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Channel 12. official told CBS News that Saturday had been a busy day of "almost all-out war" between Israel and Hezbollah. 

Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met [separately with President Biden](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-netanyahu-speech-meeting-israel-hamas-war/)

, former President Donald Trump, at Mar-a-Lago.Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordon, said on social media Sunday that the vice president had been briefed and is closely monitoring the situation.

"She condemns this horrific attack and mourns for all those killed and wounded," he added.

White House officials have feared a "nightmare scenario" of an errant rocket or missile causing unintended consequences such as mass casualties and forcing a heavier Israeli response.

Biden White House officials have been working the phones trying to de-escalate and contain the response.  But U.S. Israel's military said its air force targeted a Hezbollah arms depot in the border village of Kfar Kila, adding that militants were inside at the time.

Hezbollah said its fighters carried out 10 different attacks using rockets and explosive drones against Israeli military posts, the last of which targeted the army command of the Haramoun Brigade in Maaleh Golani with Katyusha rockets. In recent weeks, the exchange of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified, with Israeli airstrikes and rocket and drone attacks by Hezbollah striking deeper and farther away from the border.

Israel's military confirmed it had launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets "deep inside Lebanese territory."

JERUSALEM/BEIRUT, July 27 (Reuters) - A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/article/world/what-is-the-significance-of-the-golan-heights-idUSKCN1R22IR/)

The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has [raised fears](/world/middle-east/lebanon-border-israel-hezbollahs-deadly-game-patience-2024-07-24/)
 of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.

The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.

"Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office.

In a written statement, Hezbollah said: "The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard".

Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions.

The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers.

"They were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter...it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter).

The Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.

Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1.

Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters.

In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel.

Netanyahu's far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.

Item 1 of 6 Soccer pitch in Majdal Shams, a Druze village in Golan Heights, July 27, 2024. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.

The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers.

Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel "to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm".

A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war.

ATTACKS FROM LEBANON
--------------------

Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October.

Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.

The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.

At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said.

Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.

The United States "will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority," the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama'a Islamiya.

The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday."

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:51>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
I am unable to verify the claim because I have no information about the image. I need more information to determine if the image depicts Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.


## Actions

On 25 August 2024, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in one of the most intense exchanges of fire since October 2023. The Israeli military said it had targeted hundreds of rocket launchers to thwart what it described as an imminent large-scale attack by Hezbollah,[1](javascript:void(0))

Despite the heavy exchanges, both sides still seem intent on avoiding a full-scale war, and the much-feared larger and more intense escalation was averted for the time being.

#### [Ameneh Mehvar](/author/amenehmehvar/)

Dr. While Israel’s preemptive strike likely prevented a large part of Hezbollah’s planned retaliation, the Lebanese group did not attempt to target civilians or use new tactics and weaponry, including precision missiles that could have triggered a much harsher Israeli retaliation. Early that morning, more than 100 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) jets launched airstrikes on approximately 40 locations in southern Lebanon. The group claimed to have successfully targeted 11 military bases in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, as well as an intelligence unit in central Israel."

Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia backed by Iran, have engaged in [some of their heaviest cross-border air attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/24/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war)
 in months. Israeli aircraft bombarded southern Lebanon on Sunday to stop what Israel said were preparations for a major Hezbollah attack. The Israeli news media circulates footage showing Israeli air defenses intercepting rockets fired from Lebanon and describes the barrage as longer than has been typical in the months of intensified launches by Hezbollah.

**6:09 a.m.:** Hezbollah [confirms](https://t.me/C_Military1/58135)
 that it launched an attack as part of an “initial response” to the Israeli assassination of Fuad Shukr, one of the group’s most senior commanders, last month. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, later said it had fired hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel as retribution for Israel’s killing of a senior commander in July, though Israel said there had been little damage.

Here’s a look at how the latest strikes unfolded on Sunday morning in Israel and Lebanon (times are local and approximate):

**5 a.m. Eastern on Saturday):** The Israeli military says that its fighter jets have begun bombarding targets in Lebanon belonging to Hezbollah. The military “identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory,” it says.

In a video statement, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, says that Israel had begun “a self-defense act to remove these threats,” describing Hezbollah’s preparations as “extensive.” Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv is closed to flights.

**5:32 a.m.:** Air-raid sirens blare across northern Israel, warning of an incoming rocket barrage. The group says it targeted Israeli military bases and aerial defense batteries, and fired drones toward a significant but unspecified military target.

**6:20 a.m.:** Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, announces that a state of emergency is in place, limiting public gatherings. Austin III to update him on Israeli actions “to thwart an imminent threat against the State of Israel.”

* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:51>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
I am unable to verify the claim because I have no information about the image. I need more information to determine if the image depicts Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich bomb shelter Hezbollah attack")
web_search("Hezbollah attack Israel August 25 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image <image:51> is old and was taken on October 7, 2023, during a government session in Tel Aviv when sirens sounded, according to an article from Kashif.ps ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/)). The article also mentions that the photo was shared on "X" on August 25, 2024, with the claim that it was taken during Hezbollah's recent bombing of sites in Israel.

CBS News ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golan-heights-attack-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golan-heights-attack-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes/)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/)) report on a Hezbollah rocket attack on a Golan Heights soccer field on July 27, 2024, which killed at least 12 children and teens (<image:2249> and <image:2255>). The articles mention Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the August 25, 2024, attacks between Israel and Hezbollah. The attacks included air strikes, rocket barrages, and the closure of Ben-Gurion International Airport. Hezbollah claimed to have hit military bases, while the IDF claimed to have intercepted most of Hezbollah's rockets and drones. Casualties were reported on both sides. (<image:i>, <image:1>)

The New York Times reported on the cross-border attacks, which were in response to the assassination of a Hezbollah commander. The ACLED Insight article mentions that one Israeli soldier, two Hezbollah fighters, and a Hezbollah-allied member of the Amal Movement were killed during the hostilities.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image <image:51>

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from October 7, 2023, and not from August 25, 2024, as the claim states. The image was taken during a government session in Tel Aviv when sirens sounded. Therefore, the claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`misleading`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is misleading. The image used in the claim, depicting Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, was taken on October 7, 2023, during a government session in Tel Aviv, and not on August 25, 2024, as the claim suggests, as reported by [Kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/).

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)
 in May.

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

> "The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from city councils around the world"

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”.

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")
" as well as “flagrant and systematic violation of human rights.” The choice was made less than a year after [Barcelona's](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv")
 twinning program with St. Petersburg was stopped in opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Laporte invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against the Manchester United team as part of the European League and to give the embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

Representatives of Israeli Embassy with FC Barcelona PresidentIsraeli Embassy in Spain

Joan Laporta, president of the FC Barcelona soccer team, on Thursday sent a message of support for Israel, after [Barcelona announced](/news/367176)
 it would be cutting ties with Israel and ending its twin city agreement with Tel Aviv.

Laporta invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against Manchester United, and gave the Embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

In a ceremony held before the game, Laporta emphasized the club's long-standing commitment to the excellent relations with the State of Israel and the people of Israel.

The Israeli diplomats presented Laporta with an Israeli flag and thanked him for years of support for Israel, friendship and joint activity in building a bridge between nations through sport.

The meeting comes a week after Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau stated that she is suspending all of the city’s ties with Israel, citing what she called “the repeated violations of human rights of the Palestinian population and non-compliance with United Nations resolutions.”

She added that Barcelona will maintain relations with “Israeli and Palestinian entities that continue to work for peace and against apartheid.”

Tourism Minister Haim Katz [sent a letter](/news/367204)
 to his Spanish counterpart, María Reyes Maroto Illera, asking her to reverse Barcelona’s decision.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) foreign affairs bureau, meanwhile, [welcomed Barcelona’s decision](/news/367241)
.

Barcelona’s city council this week [held a vote](/news/367511)
 rejecting Colau’s stated intention last week to un-twin the city with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel, but the vote was only symbolic, as council members do not have the power to veto Colau’s decision.

 as a replacement for Barcelona.

In a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai and during a press conference, Martínez-Almeida said the twinning is a “great opportunity to show Madrid’s commitment to strengthening relations with a democratic and a law-abiding state like Israel.”

Protesters wave Israeli national flags in support of soldiers being questioned for detainee abuse, outside of the Sde Teiman military base, on Monday, July 29, 2024 \[Tsafrir Abayov/AP\]

By [Simon Speakman Cordall](/author/simon-speakman-cordall)

Published On 9 Aug 20249 Aug 2024

Video has emerged of a gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by guards at the Sde Teiman detention facility in the Negev desert, southern Israel.

The video, which has been verified by Al Jazeera, shows the prisoner being selected from a larger group lying bound on the floor. Some observers, including a local rights group and two UN agencies, have voiced concerns about the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.

However, for some, including the country’s far-right finance minister, the outrage has centred on the “crime” of recording the video, rather than the alleged rape itself.

Taking to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday night, Bezalel Smotrich demanded “an immediate criminal investigation to locate the leakers of the trending video that was intended to harm the reservists and that caused tremendous damage to Israel in the world and to exhaust the full severity of the law against them”.

Others, including the hard right and ultranationalist politicians, such as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, within Israel, have argued that any action – even gang rape – is permissible if it is undertaken for the security of the state.

Defending the indefensible
--------------------------

Following the arrest of the reservists on July 29, far-right mobs, some of which included government ministers, stormed the facility at Sde Teiman in southern Israel later the same day.

Unable to find and free the imprisoned soldiers, they then turned to the base at Beit Lid, 60km away, where the soldiers were being held for questioning, to call for the soldiers’ release.

That unrest continued during a high court hearing, convened on Wednesday to hear the petitions of Sde Teiman prisoners who are alleged to have been tortured. The same day, Smotrich, who had been among the right-wing mob to storm the prison, published a video message, saying that “IDF soldiers deserve respect” and must not be treated as “criminals”.

On being asked by Ahmad Tibi, one of the Arab MPs within the Israeli Knesset last week if it was legitimate “to insert a stick into a person’s rectum”, Hanoch Milwidsky, a member of Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, [responded](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/)
: “If he is a Nukhba \[Hamas militant\], everything is legitimate to do! This kind of abuse is systematic,” he said.

‘At odds with international law’
--------------------------------

Allegations of the systematic abuse of prisoners within a justice system which critics say is fundamentally at odds with international law have also been detailed in a separate report published on Monday by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR), and in an [unpublished report](/news/2024/3/13/after-the-unrwa-report-more-accounts-of-israels-torture-in-gaza)
 – seen by Al Jazeera in March – from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).

Responding to warnings of overcrowding within the prison system from the security agency Shin Bet in early July, Ben-Gvir repeated his call for Palestinian prisoners to be executed, tweeting that one of his principal goals since attaining office had been to “worsen the conditions of the terrorists in the prisons, and to reduce their rights to the minimum required by law”.

He said: “Everything published about the abominable conditions” of the Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons “was true”.

Human rights up for debate
--------------------------

The United States, Israel’s principal ally, called the allegations of sexual abuse of Palestinian prisoners “horrific”, saying Israel must investigate “swiftly” and “fully”.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told the media on Wednesday: “There ought to be zero tolerance for sexual abuse, rape of any detainee. Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the EU’s diplomatic service, told Politico: “The EU is gravely concerned by the allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including torture and sexual abuse of Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman military facility in Israel and elsewhere.”

Nevertheless, many within Israel continue to defend the conditions in which Palestinian prisoners are being held, as well as the rape alleged to have been carried out by the soldiers at Sde Teiman.

“Look, the question really isn’t about rape,” Ori Goldberg, a Tel Aviv-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera. The victim is then escorted to a wall, where guards, using their shields to hide their identity from the camera, proceed to rape him.

The attack is believed to have been so brutal that, after he was transferred to hospital, Israeli media reported that the [victim was unable to walk](/news/2024/7/29/israeli-far-right-politicians-protest-arrest-of-soldiers-suspected-of-abuse)
.

Ten soldiers were ultimately arrested for the rape on July 29, in a case that has rocked Israeli society. The proceedings were interrupted by demonstrators, who included victims of the October 7 Hamas-led attack, who shouted “Disgrace” and “We are the sovereign”.

Israeli pressure group Guarding the Soldiers – a new organisation formed in defence of the soldiers accused of rape – was quoted in Israeli media as saying: “The hearing in the high court this morning is absurd and a gift to \[Hamas leader Yahya\] Sinwar and murderers.”

Israeli politicians, including cabinet members, have also defended the accused. Everything!”

‘Just the tip of the iceberg’
-----------------------------

The video of the alleged gang rape at Sde Teiman is the latest piece in a growing body of evidence of abuse, sexual assault and the systematic withholding of food and medical care that Palestinians endure within the Israeli prison system.

A report titled Welcome to Hell, published this week by the Israeli human rights advocacy group, B’Tselem, includes interviews with 55 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli detention centres since October 7. The soldiers belong to a unit known as Force 100, which is tasked with guarding the Sde Teiman facility, according to Haaretz.

Military prosecutors released three of the arrested soldiers on August 4, adding to the two previously released by investigators following a military court hearing in Kfar Yona on July 30, at which protesters gathered in support of the soldiers under arrest.

The video has shocked many within Israeli society. In firsthand accounts, the prisoners, the majority of whom were later released without charge at locations across the occupied Palestinian territory, Gaza and within Israel, recount being assaulted, insulted and sexually abused by guards.

“The conditions at Sde Teiman aren’t unique."

A spokesperson for the INSS, which carried out the survey, told Reuters in an email: “As the official chart shows, the wording used on the social media post differs from what we published.” The survey, available in Hebrew https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-saying-soldiers- should-rape-prisoners-2024-08-30/ In your opinion, if it is found that there is a basis for suspicions against the five suspects, how should they be treated: (% Jews).” Referring to the Hebrew-written answers, the X post falsely stated: “65% of Israelis believe that IDF soldiers should be able to rape Palestinian prisoners 14% of Israelis are undecided if they should rape prisoners 21% of Israelis believe that Israelis should stop raping Palestine prisoners.” However, the three answers relate to how Jewish Israelis believe soldiers who commit abuses should be disciplined, not whether abuses are acceptable. According to a Reuters translation, the screenshot shows 65% of Jewish Israelis answered: “They should be dealt with disciplinarily at the command level only.” An estimated 21% answered: “They should be brought to criminal trial," while 14% answered: “I don’t know.” None of the answers in the screenshot mention “rape” or “Palestinian prisoners,” and no other results in the survey support the claims made in the social media post."

From [Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/): 
Content: "Israelis have been rattled by the events, which have highlighted the deep political divisions in the country.

A member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, speaking Monday at a meeting of lawmakers, justified the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners, shouting angrily at colleagues questioning the alleged behavior that anything was legitimate to do to "terrorists" in custody.

Lawmaker Hanoch Milwidsky was asked as he defended the alleged abuse whether it was legitimate, "to insert a stick into a person's rectum?"

"Yes!" he shouted in reply to his fellow parliamentarian. Jill Gralow/REUTERS

Other senior Israeli officials, however, including Netanyahu and army commander Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, condemned the attack on the army base by the far-right protesters.

"Breaking into a military base and disturbing the order there is severe behavior that is not acceptable in any way," Halevi said in a statement, adding: "We are in the midst of a war and actions of this type endanger the security of the state."

Netanyahu called for calm, adding his own strong condemnation of the protesters for attempting to break into the IDF base, while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that "even in difficult times, the law applies to anyone — nobody may trespass into IDF bases or violate the laws of the state of Israel."

United Nations agencies and human rights organizations, along with officials in Hamas-run Gaza and former prisoners interviewed by international news agencies, have all alleged abuse of Palestinians in Israeli detention facilities.

Israel's military insists that its detention centers are run in accordance with international law.

When questioned on Tuesday by the Saudi channel al-Hadath, Lebanese General Wehbe Katicha proposed that sending the ships was perhaps "a way to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as on Iran and Hezbollah, to avoid further escalation."

"These ships are here to contain the situation and not to engage in military actions because no one wants an extended war," he added.

What do we know about these three American fleet ships?

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

BALTOP24 ships at sea

240608-N-JC445-1024 BALTIC SEA (June 8, 2024) Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024. BALTOPS24 is the premier maritime-focused exercise in the Baltic Region. The exercise, led by U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa and executed by Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO, provides a unique training opportunity to strengthen combined response capabilities critical to preserving freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea.

BALTIC SEA  –  

Twenty NATO Allies concluded the 53rd iteration of exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS-24) in Kiel, Germany, June 20, 2024.

During their time in port, Allies gathered to reflect on the accomplishments and success achieved throughout the 21-day Baltic Region exercise involving more than 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel.

Vice Adm. Thomas Ishee, Commander of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO) and U.S. 6th Fleet, reflected on the critical nature of the NATO Alliance in the region, and how integral BALTOPS-24 is in advancing Allies' shared objectives in the Baltic.

"BALTOPS-24 is not only the largest iteration in its 53-year history, but the first in nearly 30 years that all participants are NATO Allies," Vice Adm. Ishee said. "NATO Nations account for nearly all 8,000 km of Baltic coastline. That's eight of nine Baltic Sea Nations who share values for Freedom of Navigation and the legitimate use of the Baltic Sea.

The exercise began with a pre-sail conference June 4 in Klaipeda, Lithuania, where exercise staff and senior leaders met to finalize the scenario and operations, and discuss the unique maritime challenges and opportunities of the Baltic Region.

"Beginning in 1972, BALTOPS continues to build trust, foster understanding and enhanced interoperability across the maritime, air, land, and space domains," said Vice Adm. Ishee. "But more importantly, the gathering of so many nations demonstrates our collective strength, resolve and commitment to Baltic Sea regional security."

June 8 marked the beginning of the underway portion of exercise, with 30 NATO warships sailing alongside each other in one of the largest maritime formations in the region's history.

This year saw the largest assembled coalition of amphibious forces in the Baltic Sea, with four Amphibious Task Groups (ATG) and Multinational Task Units exercising amphibious capabilities in Skrunda, Latvia; Gotland, Sweden; Utska, Poland; and Putlos, Germany. Each area presented unique challenges to integrated amphibious operations, which were leveraged by the multinational amphibious assault teams to practice competencies together.

At-sea, the U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), and San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS New York (LPD 21), the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), and the French Navy amphibious assault ship FS Mistral (L 9013) were central to the integration of BALTOPS-24 amphibious capabilities. On land, armed forces from more than eight NATO nations conducted urban warfare training; tactical recovery of personnel; aerial insertions; beach landings; forest navigation; deployment of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System; free-jumping into simulated contested territory and full-scale amphibious assaults on an opposing force.

"\[BALTOPS-24\] is a multidisciplinary exercise, comprising several warfare domains. specifically, amphibious operations, which is a very important part of LHD Mistral," said French Navy Capt. Olivier Roussille, commanding officer of the FS Mistral. "The objective \[of the exercise\] is to contribute to NATO reassurance in the area, and build a sustainable legacy to the benefit of collective defense, while strengthening our ties and interoperability with the Allied navy sailors."

This iteration of BALTOPS-24 also hosted the largest assembled coalition of mine countermeasure (MCM) forces in NATO, leading to a robust docket of MCM activity throughout the 21-day exercise. Deploying more than 700 personnel, 20 surface ships, 20 unmanned systems, and two MH-60S Seahawk helicopters, Swedish, French, Norwegian, Dutch, and U.S. forces scanned the seabed to develop an operating picture, practiced locating mines with surface assets, deployed the Airborne Mine Neutralization System for aerial mine recovery, and finalized their multinational MCM collaboration with an MCM combat rehearsal.

"BALTOPS allows us to sharpen the sword of our MCM capabilities, but also brings together all of the NATO partners that may go in and remove that mine threat," Capt. Scott Hattaway, director of Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), and lead for all MCM activity during BALTOPS 24. "No one country goes into an MCM operation by themselves. We practice now as an international cohort in order to prepare for when we do it for real."

At sea, NATO warships conducted tactical maneuvering drills, anti-submarine warfare training, gunnery and small caliber live fire events, and air defense exercises. Of significant note, the alliance practiced the integration of medical capabilities, with the USS Wasp, USS New York, the Royal Netherlands Navy Rotterdam class landing platform dock ship HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61) simulating a mass casualty drill and patient transfers between vessels.

In addition to medical readiness, the NATO team also practiced the integration of its spiritual readiness staff. Seventeen chaplains, Religious Program Specialists, and assistants from 10 NATO nations participated in a conference aboard the USS Mount Whitney to learn about NATO Spiritual Support Interoperability (SSI) initiatives. Later, Dutch, Finnish and U.S. chaplains would meet aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt to discuss how multinational chaplains could support a multinational force.

Also at-sea, Royal Navy, Lithuanian Navy, and U.S. Navy service members conducted joint personnel recovery operations. During the operation, a Royal Navy small craft placed both a mannequin and a Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) specialist into the Baltic Sea. After receiving a simulated recovery request, Lithuanian Navy Ship LNS Skalvis (P14) recovered the dummy, a MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter attached to HSC-28 deployed a rescue swimmer into the water and recovered the live survivor, who then was dropped off onto one of the Royal Navy vessels, HMS Example.

All of these events - whether at-sea, ashore, or in the air - were planned and coordinated by a substantial multinational coalition of liaison officers and augmentees operating out of the STRIKFORNATO headquarters in Oeiras, Portugal. These liaison officers were the conduit through which directives, intelligence, and requests flowed, bridging the gap between command levels, operational units, and supporting elements, and acting as the beating heart of exercise BALTOPS-24.

Of special significance, for the first time in BALTOPS history, nearly all of the 8,000 kilometers of the Baltic Coastline is safeguarded by NATO Allies. This is only possible due to the accession of Finland in 2023, and the more recent accession of Sweden on March 7, 2024.

"Since we joined three months ago, it's important for Sweden to show that we, as a nation, contribute to the security and stability in the Baltic Sea region as it is our home turf as well," says Lt. Tobias Irebro, liaison officer with the Swedish Navy. "It also lets us show that we are a willing contributor as a newly joined ally. It's also very important for the Baltic countries to exercise security and stability in the region as they depend on the sea as a main logistics asset for importing and exporting."

Looking towards the future, preparations have already begun for next year's exercise, which will take into account the valuable lessons gleaned from BALTOPS-24 and aim to expand upon its achievements in BALTOPS-25.

STRIKFORNATO, headquartered at Oeiras, Portugal, is a rapidly deployable and scalable headquarters, under the operational command of SACEUR, capable of planning and executing full spectrum joint maritime operations including maritime Ballistic Missile Defence, primarily through integration of U.S. and other nations' carrier and amphibious forces into NATO operations to provide assurance, deterrence, and collective defence for the Alliance.

Headquartered in Naples, Italy, NAVEUR-NAVAF operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and combined naval operations.

BALTOPS 24 Concludes In Kiel, Germany
=====================================

24 June 2024

From U.S. 6th Fleet & Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO Public Affairs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

BALTIC SEA — Twenty NATO Allies concluded the 53rd iteration of exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS-24) in Kiel, Germany, June 20, 2024.

 [![Download Icon](/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Styles/Navy2/download-icon-white.png) Download](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jun/22/2003490725/-1/-1/0/240608-N-JC445-1024.JPG)

During their time in port, Allies gathered to reflect on the accomplishments and success achieved throughout the 21-day Baltic Region exercise involving more than 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel.

Vice Adm. Thomas Ishee, Commander of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO) and U.S. 6th Fleet, reflected on the critical nature of the NATO Alliance in the region, and how integral BALTOPS-24 is in advancing Allies' shared objectives in the Baltic.

"BALTOPS-24 is not only the largest iteration in its 53-year history, but the first in nearly 30 years that all participants are NATO Allies," Vice Adm. Ishee said. "NATO Nations account for nearly all 8,000 km of Baltic coastline. That's eight of nine Baltic Sea Nations who share values for Freedom of Navigation and the legitimate use of the Baltic Sea.

The exercise began with a pre-sail conference June 4 in Klaipeda, Lithuania, where exercise staff and senior leaders met to finalize the scenario and operations, and discuss the unique maritime challenges and opportunities of the Baltic Region.

"Beginning in 1972, BALTOPS continues to build trust, foster understanding and enhanced interoperability across the maritime, air, land, and space domains," said Vice Adm. Ishee. "But more importantly, the gathering of so many nations demonstrates our collective strength, resolve and commitment to Baltic Sea regional security."

June 8 marked the beginning of the underway portion of exercise, with 30 NATO warships sailing alongside each other in one of the largest maritime formations in the region's history.

This year saw the largest assembled coalition of amphibious forces in the Baltic Sea, with four Amphibious Task Groups (ATG) and Multinational Task Units exercising amphibious capabilities in Skrunda, Latvia; Gotland, Sweden; Utska, Poland; and Putlos, Germany. Each area presented unique challenges to integrated amphibious operations, which were leveraged by the multinational amphibious assault teams to practice competencies together.

At-sea, the U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), and San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS New York (LPD 21), the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), and the French Navy amphibious assault ship FS Mistral (L 9013) were central to the integration of BALTOPS-24 amphibious capabilities. On land, armed forces from more than eight NATO nations conducted urban warfare training; tactical recovery of personnel; aerial insertions; beach landings; forest navigation; deployment of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System; free-jumping into simulated contested territory and full-scale amphibious assaults on an opposing force.

"\[BALTOPS-24\] is a multidisciplinary exercise, comprising several warfare domains. specifically, amphibious operations, which is a very important part of LHD Mistral," said French Navy Capt. Olivier Roussille, commanding officer of the FS Mistral. "The objective \[of the exercise\] is to contribute to NATO reassurance in the area, and build a sustainable legacy to the benefit of collective defense, while strengthening our ties and interoperability with the Allied navy sailors."

This iteration of BALTOPS-24 also hosted the largest assembled coalition of mine countermeasure (MCM) forces in NATO, leading to a robust docket of MCM activity throughout the 21-day exercise. Deploying more than 700 personnel, 20 surface ships, 20 unmanned systems, and two MH-60S Seahawk helicopters, Swedish, French, Norwegian, Dutch, and U.S. forces scanned the seabed to develop an operating picture, practiced locating mines with surface assets, deployed the Airborne Mine Neutralization System for aerial mine recovery, and finalized their multinational MCM collaboration with an MCM combat rehearsal.

"BALTOPS allows us to sharpen the sword of our MCM capabilities, but also brings together all of the NATO partners that may go in and remove that mine threat," Capt. Scott Hattaway, director of Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), and lead for all MCM activity during BALTOPS 24. "No one country goes into an MCM operation by themselves. We practice now as an international cohort in order to prepare for when we do it for real."

At sea, NATO warships conducted tactical maneuvering drills, anti-submarine warfare training, gunnery and small caliber live fire events, and air defense exercises. Of significant note, the alliance practiced the integration of medical capabilities, with the USS Wasp, USS New York, the Royal Netherlands Navy Rotterdam class landing platform dock ship HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61) simulating a mass casualty drill and patient transfers between vessels.

In addition to medical readiness, the NATO team also practiced the integration of its spiritual readiness staff. Seventeen chaplains, Religious Program Specialists, and assistants from 10 NATO nations participated in a conference aboard the USS Mount Whitney to learn about NATO Spiritual Support Interoperability (SSI) initiatives.

The exercise involved over 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel from NATO allies. The USS Mount Whitney arrived in Kiel, Germany on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24.

The image is from the U.S. Navy website. BALTOPS 24 concluded on June 20, 2024, in Kiel, Germany. The photo was taken by Petty Officer 2nd Class Mario Coto.


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The exercise concluded on June 20, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is misrepresented. The image shows ships participating in the BALTOPS 24 exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.

`misleading`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is misrepresented. The photo shows the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search. While the U.S. did send warships to the Mediterranean in August 2024, as reported by The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html)), the image does not depict this event.

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election on July 5 in Tehran, Iran.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

The military wing of Hamas said it had carried out “two shooting operations” near the city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday in response to the killing of the group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh.  

The Al Qassam Brigades said it was “the beginning of a swift response to the cowardly assassination of our great national leader, the martyr Ismail Haniyeh.”

“Hebron will lead the way in carrying out qualitative operations in the coming days, by the will of Allah,” it added.

The Israel Defense Forces said a civilian was in the hospital after being shot at and stabbed northeast of Hebron.

Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said a 50-year-old man was hospitalized in serious condition after being stabbed on Route 60 near Kiryat Arba, a settlement on the outskirts of Hebron."

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS
=============================================================

![Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh attends a meeting with members of international media in Gazaa](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/442230)

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/holcoursepopup.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

The Palestinian digital rights group Sada Social on Saturday [called for](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 an investigation into Israel’s alleged use of WhatsApp user data to target Palestinians with its AI system, Lavender.

The group, which is affiliated with the Al Jazeera Media Institute and Access Now, accused Meta, which owns WhatsApp, of fueling “the ‘Lavender’ artificial intelligence system used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinian individuals within the [Gaza](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/gaza)
 enclave.”

As _Common Dreams_ [reported](https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-ai-targets)
 in April, the [Israel](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/israel)
 Defense Forces has relied on AI systems including Lavender to target people Israel believes to be Hamas members.

At _+972 Magazine_, Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham [wrote](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)
 that a current commander of an elite Israeli intelligence unit pushed for the use of AI to choose targets in Gaza. “The Israeli Lavender system, supported by artificial intelligence, identifies Palestinians by tracking their communications via WhatsApp or the groups they join.”

The mention of Israel’s use of WhatsApp data in Abraham’s reporting also caught the attention last month of Paul Biggar, founder of Tech for [Palestine](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/palestine)
.

“There’s a lot wrong with this—I’m in plenty of WhatsApp groups with strangers, neighbors, and in the carnage in Gaza you bet people are making groups to connect,” [wrote](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/meta-and-lavender/)

_Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The commander wrote in a guide book to create the system that “hundreds and thousands” of features can be used to select targets, “such as being in a WhatsApp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.”

Sada Social asserted that it had found the Lavender system uses WhatsApp data to select targets.

“The reports monitored by the Sada Social Center indicate that one of the inputs to the ‘Lavender’ system relies on data collected from WhatsApp groups containing names of Palestinians or activists who are wanted by ‘Israel,'” [said](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 the group in a press release. Meta has been promoting WhatsApp as a ‘private’ social network, including ‘end-to-end’ encryption of messages.”

“Providing this data as input for Lavender undermines their claim that WhatsApp is a private messaging app,” he wrote. No social network should be providing this sort of information about its users to countries engaging in ‘pre-crime.'”

Others have pointed out that Israel may have acquired WhatsApp data through means other than a leak by Meta.

Journalist Marc Owen Jones said the question of “Meta’s potential role in this is important,” but noted that informants, captured devices, and spyware could be used by Israel to gain Palestinian users’ WhatsApp data.

Bahraini activist Esra’a Al Shafei, founder of Majal.org, [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 the _Middle East Monitor_ that the reports that WhatsApp user data has been used by the IDF’s AI machine demonstrate why privacy advocates warn against the collection and storage of metadata, “particularly for apps like WhatsApp, which falsely advertise their product as fully private.”

“Even though WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, and claims to not have any backdoors to any government, the metadata alone is sufficient to expose detailed information about users, especially if the user’s phone number is attached to other Meta products and related activities,” Al Shafei said. “This is why the IDF could plausibly utilize metadata to track and locate WhatsApp users.”

While Meta and WhatsApp may not necessarily be collaborating with Israel, she said, “by the very act of collecting this information, they’re making themselves vulnerable to abuse and intrusive external surveillance.”

In turn, “by using WhatsApp, people are risking their lives,” she added.

A WhatsApp spokesperson [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 _Anadolu_ last month that “WhatsApp has no backdoors and we do not provide bulk information to any government,” adding that “Meta has provided consistent transparency reports and those include the limited circumstances when WhatsApp information has been requested.”

Al Shafei said Meta must “fully investigate” how WhatsApp’s metadata may be used “to track, harm, or kill its users throughout Palestine.”

“WhatsApp is used by billions of people and these users have a right to know what the dangers are in using the app,” she said, “or what WhatsApp and Meta will do to proactively protect them from such misuse.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024")

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, by an Israeli attack (<image:i>). The article also mentions that Israel's Defense Minister confirmed Israel's responsibility in the assassination in December 2024. The CNN article, updated August 1, 2024, reports that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:i>).

The CNN article states that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. <image:1> Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. <image:1>

The sources are: [https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/), [https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), and [https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

Content: "Since October 7, Israel has been promoting a new generation of armed attacks that rely on algorithmic targeting.

On the night of July 30-31, Israel targeted the Haret Hreik area in Beirut’s southern suburbs, Dahyeh, assassinating Fouad Shokr, a senior advisor to Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and an exclusive veterans’ facility belonging to the Revolutionary Guards in northern Tehran, where Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, was also assassinated.

In 1992, locating targets was far more complex due to the “miserable state of Israeli intelligence on Hezbollah,” as described by New York Times journalist Ronen Bergman in his book _Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations_.

Bergman details the difficulties Israeli intelligence faced in gathering information about the residence of Hezbollah’s former Secretary-General, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi. thesis on Hezbollah, and then recruited agents to gather intelligence on al-Musawi, paving the way for his assassination.

This is not the first time Israel has employed artificial intelligence; it previously [used](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/4/5/israel_ai)
 these technologies during its war on Gaza in 2021 and in the ongoing conflict.

Israel operates what former Israeli army officers describe as a “[mass assassination factory](https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/)
,” where children in Gaza are not seen as “collateral damage.” According to these officers, every victim is killed based on algorithms and calculations known to the military.

The Israeli secret intelligence service, the Mossad, also uses artificial intelligence to carry out assassinations in Iran, exploiting the country’s entanglement in international sanctions, which hinder its ability to counter such programs.

An Iranian security source told [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/07/haniyeh-assassination-iran-choice/679304/)
 that “Israel used AI technology to track Ismail Haniyeh in preparation for his assassination, the same system it used in 2020 to assassinate a senior security official near Tehran.”

In October 2020, Israel assassinated Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard officer and nuclear scientist, with a bullet fired via satellite command. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html)
 reported, citing an intelligence official familiar with the plan at the time, that “Israel chose a special model of the Belgian-made FN MAG machine gun, equipped with an advanced robotic system and multiple cameras to assassinate the nuclear scientist, and this ‘[killer robot](https://www.mc-doualiya.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7/20210921-%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%88-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA-%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87)
,’ capable of firing 600 rounds per minute, was operated via satellite.”

Media reports [indicate](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 that Israel assassinated Ismail Haniyeh with a bomb hidden in his room for nearly two months.

Axios, citing sources, [reported](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/01/haniyeh-assassination-mossad)
 that the bomb was in a high-tech device using artificial intelligence, and it was detonated remotely by Mossad agents on Iranian soil.

Lebanon, due to its limited financial resources, cannot develop its technology, telecommunications, and cybersecurity capabilities, which exposes its citizens to data leaks and potentially being added to the list of AI-determined assassination targets.

Experts have [revealed](https://www.almarkazia.com/ar/news/show/530841/%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81)
 that Israel has infiltrated Lebanon’s telecommunications network and is using data such as voice recognition to identify targets.

Machines Decide Who Lives and Who Dies
--------------------------------------

Since the beginning of the October 7 attacks, Israel has revealed three target-generation systems: The Gospel for infrastructure targets, Lavender for individual human targets, and Where is Daddy?—a system designed to track and target suspected individuals when they are at home with their families.

In 2021, Yossi Sarel, the [current commander](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/top-israeli-spy-chief-exposes-his-true-identity-in-online-security-lapse)
 of the Israeli intelligence unit 8200, argued in his [book](https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Human_Machine_Team_How_to_Create_Syn.html?id=hjl1zgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y)
 for the design of a machine capable of analyzing vast amounts of data to generate thousands of military targets. While EU regulations indicate the need for designers and controllers to implement measures to protect individuals’ data, such as data encryption, questions remain about what “encryption” means and whether AI programs are designed to identify the data owners in the first place.

Even though Israel has not signed on to EU regulations, its responsibility remains, given that most of those it monitors are civilian citizens, many of whom hold foreign, including European, nationalities.

In its war on Gaza, Israel has recorded a new breach of international law and human rights, not only through the use of AI in mass killings but also by intruding into the lives of civilians in the Middle East.

Israel’s response to the Majdal Shams incident, which it claimed was orchestrated by Hezbollah, was not surprising. Israeli intelligence began by tracking Lebanese press reports, consulted a Ph.D. According to an [investigative report](https://www.972mag.com/hamas-fatah-elections-israel-arrogance/)
 cited by _The Guardian_, this machine is indeed operational under the name Lavender.

Since the October 7 attacks, Lavender has turned Israeli soldiers into mere “rubber stamps,” as they are required to spend just 20 seconds reviewing a target and confirming that it is “male and not female” before proceeding with the strike.

Unit 8200, part of Israeli intelligence, designed this system to identify individuals suspected of having ties to the military wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, including those with low ranks, as potential targets for airstrikes.

The program hits 90 percent of its targets and can discern whether individuals have weak ties to the targeted groups, like Hamas, or no connection at all. The system assigns almost every person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, reflecting the likelihood of that person being a combatant.

Lavender evaluates individuals based on a range of data, such as participation in a WhatsApp group with a known fighter, changing mobile phones every few months, photos, phone numbers, social media friendships, and frequent changes of address.

The system even adds individuals with communication patterns similar to those of Hamas or Islamic Jihad members—like police officers or civil defense personnel—to the assassination list. The [report](about:blank)
 quotes an intelligence officer saying that the Israeli army “doesn’t waste expensive bombs on unimportant people—it’s too costly for the country, and there’s a shortage of such bombs.”

The Israeli army had previously announced the use of The Gospel (Gospel), an AI technology developed by Unit 8200, in warfare. to [deliver](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/4/5/israel_ai)
 lethal strikes to jihadists as soon as they enter their homes, sending notifications to intelligence officers as soon as a person enters their residence.

Israel has access to AI programs such as [biometric surveillance, predictive policing systems](https://www.accessnow.org/publication/artificial-genocidal-intelligence-israel-gaza/)
, [GPS-based targeting technologies, biometric sensing, and behavior analysis](https://www.almarkazia.com/ar/news/show/530841/%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81)
.

According to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/technology/israel-facial-recognition-gaza.html)
, Israel uses biometric surveillance, a system that employs data from the Israeli company Corsight and Google Photos to identify faces in crowds, even from low-quality drone footage.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. <image:1> Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. <image:1>

The sources are: [https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/), [https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), and [https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. <image:1> Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. <image:1>

The sources are: [https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/), [https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), and [https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

!Félix Maradiaga <image:2366>

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

!Gulbahar Haitiwaji <image:2367>

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

!Sana Seif, on June 14 in Oslo. Behind her, an image of a demonstration in which she demanded the freedom of her brother Alaa. <image:2368>

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

!Abdulrahman Almawwas <image:2369>

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

The child was later transferred to Abu Dhabi's Burjeel Hospital. The image was used by Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to try to whitewash their image.

The image appears in articles from Enab Baladi ([https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), UAE Times ([https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), and El País ([https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html)). <image:59>


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Syrian child named Sham rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, Syria, after an earthquake in February 2023. The claim that the image shows a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024 is false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Syrian child rescued from the rubble in Syria after an earthquake in February 2023, not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin, content, and meaning of the image.

`misleading`

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

U.S. ambassador to the [United Nations](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm)
 [Nikki Haley](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/nikki-haley.htm)
 joined Tillerson in his condemnation of Russia, releasing a paper statement that said, "This attack in Syria should weigh heavily" on Russia's "conscience."

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

International team of doctors visiting a Gaza hospital are stunned by the war’s toll on Palestinian children
============================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 28, 2024 1:59 PM EDT

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza (AP) — An international team of doctors visiting a hospital in central Gaza was prepared for the worst. The majority of its intensive care unit beds are occupied by children, including infants wrapped in bandages and wearing oxygen masks.

“I spend most of my time here resuscitating children,” Haj-Hassan said after a recent shift. But the gruesome impact Israel’s war against Hamas is having on Palestinian children still left them stunned.

One toddler died from a brain injury caused by an Israeli strike that fractured his skull. Beside him was his sister, but he didn’t recognize her because burns covered almost her entire body.

These gut-wrenching casualties were described to The Associated Press by Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive-care doctor from Jordan, following a 10-hour overnight shift at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah.

Haj-Hassan, who has extensive experience in Gaza and regularly speaks out about the war’s devastating effects, was part of a team that recently finished a two-week stint there.

[**WATCH:** Experts warn of ‘imminent’ famine in Gaza with lack of aid reaching Palestinians](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/experts-warn-of-imminent-famine-in-gaza-with-lack-of-aid-reaching-palestinians)

After nearly six months of war, Gaza’s health sector has been decimated. Many bring their children with them to the hospital to keep them close, Abu Qassim said.

“It’s just miserable,” he said.

Thousands of people driven from their homes by the war are also living in the hospital grounds, hoping it will be safe. Now, many Israelis must decide whether to go back](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/they-fled-kibbutzim-after-hamas-attacked-now-many-israelis-must-decide-whether-to-go-back)

Roughly half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are 17 or younger, the U.N.’s agency for children estimates.

Israel holds Hamas responsible for non-combatants’ deaths and injuries because the militants in Gaza operate from within civilian areas. The Israeli government believes around 100 hostages being held in Gaza are still alive.

In the early stages of the war, Israel severely limited the entry of food, fuel and medical supplies into Gaza. Al-Aqsa Martyrs has also been short on anesthetics, meaning surgeries and other procedures are frequently performed without painkillers.

Haj-Hassan says there is only one way to end Gaza’s health care crisis.

“They need the war to stop,” she said.

 Mar 27 Roughly a dozen of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are only partially functioning. “What does that tell you about every other hospital in the Gaza Strip?”

A different team of international doctors working at Al-Aqsa Martyrs in January stayed at a nearby guesthouse."

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. She was 5 days old.

### Increased airstrikes on Rafah kill mostly women and children

The newborn's death comes during an uptick in Israeli airstrikes on Rafah, where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians have sought shelter in the nearly seven-month-long war that erupted Oct. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

### [What to know about a possible Israeli military offensive in Rafah](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1246857306/rafah-gaza-israel-military-offensive)

Israel's military says it is planning an [assault on Rafah](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1246857306/rafah-gaza-israel-military-offensive)
 to go after Hamas, but it has not said when that might happen. The [Biden administration says](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/18/1239298104/biden-speaks-with-netanyahu-as-tensions-rise-over-the-war-in-gaza)
 it is concerned about the toll an offensive in Rafah could have on civilians, even if they are told to evacuate.

Israel has said that Hamas battalions operate in Rafah. Women says, on average, two mothers have been [killed per hour](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/press-release/2024/01/press-release-two-mothers-are-killed-in-gaza-every-hour-as-fighting-exceeds-100-days)
