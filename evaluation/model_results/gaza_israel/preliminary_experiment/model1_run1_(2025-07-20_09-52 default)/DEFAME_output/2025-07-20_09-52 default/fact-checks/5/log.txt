Useful result: From [Source](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east): Found exact image on website with title: Gaza under fire: Israeli jets strike Hamas targets after Tel Aviv attack
Content: The search result from Arab News PK contains an image of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares over the Gaza Strip on March 25, 2019. <image:590>. The article is titled "Gaza under fire: Israeli jets strike Hamas targets after Tel Aviv attack" and was updated on March 26, 2019. The article also mentions that Israeli warplanes attacked targets across the coastal enclave.

Reverse image searches reveal that the image is related to events in Gaza in 2019, as reported by [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/), [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03), and [Arab News PK](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east).
