Useful result: From [Source](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/more-50000-children-killed-or-injured-gaza): 
Content: The UNICEF USA published an article on May 28, 2025, stating that more than 50,000 children have been reported dead or injured in Gaza since October 2023. The article mentions that 10 siblings under age 12 were pulled from the rubble of their family's home in Khan Younis. <image:i>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents): 
Content: PBS News reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, in March 2025, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. <image:1757> A month-old baby girl was pulled from the rubble, while her parents and brother were killed in the strike. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, and has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.democracynow.org/2025/5/27/dr_alaa_al_najjar_gaza): 
Content: Democracy Now! published a story on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike on the home of a Palestinian pediatrician in Gaza, killing nine of her ten children. <image:1758>

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza as the claim suggests, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as/)).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
