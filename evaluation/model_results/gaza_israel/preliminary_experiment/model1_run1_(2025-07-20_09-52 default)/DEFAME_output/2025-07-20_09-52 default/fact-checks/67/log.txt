The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While the Turkish President did call for international intervention regarding Israel's actions in Syria, as reported by the [Arab Weekly](https://www.thearabweekly.com/turkey-grapples-over-answer-israels-destabilising-intervention-syria-agendas-collide), this occurred in February 2025, not March 2025 as the claim states.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
