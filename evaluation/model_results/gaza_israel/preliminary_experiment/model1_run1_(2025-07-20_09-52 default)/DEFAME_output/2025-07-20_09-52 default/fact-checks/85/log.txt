Content: The search result is a fact-check by Reuters, published on August 30, 2024, regarding a mistranslation of an Israeli opinion poll. The original poll, conducted by INSS, asked about the treatment of soldiers suspected of abuse, not whether rape is acceptable. The fact-check includes the original Hebrew question and clarifies that the social media post misrepresented the poll's findings. <image:54>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/): 
Content: The CBS News article discusses the detention and questioning of nine Israel Defense Forces reservists suspected of raping and abusing a Palestinian prisoner. The article mentions that some senior government officials justified the abuse of Palestinian prisoners. <image:2296>, <image:2297>. The article was written by Debora Patta.

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. A Reuters fact-check ([https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fact-Check-Israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-as-saying-soldiers-%E2%80%98should-rape-prisoners-poll-conducted-by-Mora-Deitch-Rebecca-Meller-Idit-Shafran-and-Anat-Shapira-in-Reuters-for-site-.pdf](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fact-Check-Israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-as-saying-soldiers-%E2%80%98should-rape-prisoners-poll-conducted-by-Mora-Deitch-Rebecca-Meller-Idit-Shafran-and-Anat-Shapira-in-Reuters-for-site-.pdf)) reveals that the poll's question was mistranslated, and the original poll did not ask about the acceptability of rape.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
