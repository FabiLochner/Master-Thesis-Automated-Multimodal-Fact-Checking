Useful result: From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/09/22/733773/explainer-hezbollah-struck-ramat-david-airbase-rafael-arms-factory-haifa): 
Content: The Press TV website reports that Hezbollah launched a barrage of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets targeting the Ramat David airbase and military airport southeast of Haifa on September 22, 2024. The article mentions that the airbase has three runways and covers an area of six square kilometers. The article also mentions that the attacks followed the assassination of Aqil and other senior Hezbollah officials in an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The article includes images <image:2202>, <image:2211>, <image:2213>, <image:2214>, <image:2216>.

The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified because, while there is evidence of a Hezbollah rocket attack on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, the provided image has not been found in any of the search results ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel), [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/), [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267), [Press TV](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/09/22/733773/explainer-hezbollah-struck-ramat-david-airbase-rafael-arms-factory-haifa)).
