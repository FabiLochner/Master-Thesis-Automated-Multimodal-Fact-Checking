The image ![image 65](media/99.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source, from Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)), describes an incident from December 2011 where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a Palestinian woman. The article includes a photo of a dog attacking a woman.

Another source, from Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), published on January 6, 2025, discusses an attack by an Israeli combat dog on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023. The image ![image 65](media/99.jpg)

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The web search revealed two incidents involving Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, but neither of them matches the image in the claim. One incident occurred in December 2011, and the other in late October 2023. The claim states the image is from June 2024.

Based on the evidence, there is no information to verify the claim that the image is authentic.
