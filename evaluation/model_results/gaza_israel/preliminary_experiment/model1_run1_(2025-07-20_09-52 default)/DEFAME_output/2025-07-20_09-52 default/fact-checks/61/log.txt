Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bridgemanimages.com/en-US/noartistknown/a-palestinian-girl-hangs-clothes-in-front-of-hole-made-by-tank-rocket-in-rafah-2000-09-28-photo/photograph/asset/7814171): 
Content: The search result from Bridgeman Images includes a photograph of a Palestinian girl hanging clothes in front of a hole made by a tank rocket in Rafah on September 28, 2000. <image:1744>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/displaced-lives-struggle-survival-gaza): 
Content: The search result from Doctors Without Borders includes an image of Palestinian women. <image:1745>

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is not enough information.
Justification: The provided evidence does not verify the claim. While the search results include articles about events in Gaza and images of Palestinian women, they do not contain the image of the tank with clothes drying on it. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
