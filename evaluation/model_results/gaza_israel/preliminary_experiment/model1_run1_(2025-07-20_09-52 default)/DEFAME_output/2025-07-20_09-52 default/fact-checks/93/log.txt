Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk): 
Content: The CNN article, updated on July 19, 2024, reports on a global tech outage caused by a software update from CrowdStrike, impacting airlines, banks, businesses, schools, and government services. The article mentions flight cancellations and delays. <image:2545>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/tech-outage-disrupts-global-air-travel-and-banking-impacts-israeli-hospitals/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports on a global technology outage on July 19, 2024, impacting banks, airlines, and hospitals. Ben Gurion Airport was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted. <image:2563>, <image:2564>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-tech-outage-delays-flights-disrupts-services-around-world-2024-07-19/): 
Content: The Reuters article, published on July 19, 2024, reports on a global tech outage affecting various sectors, including airlines and airports. The article mentions that a computer systems "incident" at all Spanish airports may cause flight delays. <image:2545>
The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While a Houthi attack and a global tech outage affecting airports occurred on July 19, 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The image search results show crowded airports in Israel, but do not link the image to the specific event.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
