## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows a Syrian child named Sham who was rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib countryside, Syria, after an earthquake on February 6 or 7, 2023. The child was later transferred to Abu Dhabi's Burjeel Hospital. The image was used by Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to try to whitewash their image.

The image appears in articles from Enab Baladi ([https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), UAE Times ([https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), and El País ([https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html)). ![image 59](media/92.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Syrian child named Sham rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, Syria, after an earthquake in February 2023. The claim that the image shows a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024 is false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Syrian child rescued from the rubble in Syria after an earthquake in February 2023, not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin, content, and meaning of the image.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image depicts a Syrian child rescued from the rubble in Syria after an earthquake in February 2023, not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024. The image was used by Asma al-Assad to try to whitewash their image. The image appears in articles from Enab Baladi, UAE Times, and El País.
