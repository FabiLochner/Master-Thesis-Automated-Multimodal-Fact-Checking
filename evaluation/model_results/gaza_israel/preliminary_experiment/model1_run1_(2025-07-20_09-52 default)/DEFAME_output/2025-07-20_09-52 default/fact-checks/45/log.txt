Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html): 
Content: The New York Post reports that Greta Thunberg was filmed saying "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany in December. <image:396>

The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While Greta Thunberg did say "f–k Israel" at a rally in December 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that she held a sign with the words "FUCK ISRAEL" in November 2024. The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)) reported on her statement.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
