Some protesters carried pro-Palestinian messages <image:i>. The BBC News article discusses protests in France after President Macron refused to nominate a government led by the left-wing New Popular Front alliance (NFP) following the parliamentary elections. The NFP wanted Lucie Castets as prime minister, but Macron sought to form a government excluding both the far-right National Rally and the radical France Unbowed. The article also mentions a planned demonstration on September 7. ![image 3803](media/2025-08-23_00-36-1755909375-639200.jpg), ![image 3804](media/2025-08-23_00-36-1755909376-271717.jpg), ![image 3806](media/2025-08-23_00-36-1755909376-873885.jpg)
