### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1247453317/gaza-baby-girl-mother-killed-israel-airstrike](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1247453317/gaza-baby-girl-mother-killed-israel-airstrike)) discusses a baby girl in Gaza who died after an Israeli airstrike, including images of the baby in an incubator ![image 4778](media/2025-08-23_01-09-1755911389-613447.jpg)

## Elaboration
The reverse image search confirms the existence of the image. The web search reveals an NPR article about a baby girl in Gaza who died after an Israeli airstrike. However, the article does not contain the image in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024, holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. The evidence does not confirm the details of the claim. More information is needed to verify the claim.
