Useful result: From [Source](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/): Found exact image on website with title: Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily
Content: The image <image:649> is found on Harapan Daily, in an article titled "Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran". The article discusses the Israeli aggression against Gaza, the role of the United States and the West, and the Iranian factor. The article mentions an Iranian drone and missile operation targeting Israeli military installations in April 2024.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, as evidenced by sources like "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)" and "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max/)", which label it as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area. The claim's assertion of an October 26, 2024, event involving Israel and Iranian military targets is not supported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
