## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency ([Source](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting)) reported on April 7, 2025, that the Israeli ambassador was removed from an African Union meeting. The article mentions that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from the meeting during an annual session focused on the Rwandan genocide.

The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/)) reported that Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia Avraham Neguise was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa. JNS ([Source](https://www.jns.org/israeli-envoy-ejected-from-african-union-event-on-rwandan-genocide/)) reported on April 8, 2025, that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was ejected from an African Union meeting in Addis Ababa. Neguise has served as ambassador to Ethiopia since August 2024. ![image 3795](media/2025-08-23_00-36-1755909364-099939.jpg), ![image 3807](media/2025-08-23_00-36-1755909378-578799.jpg), <image:k>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union meeting in Addis Ababa in April 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador. It only mentions the removal from the meeting.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests a removal from a meeting, not an expulsion.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union meeting in April 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador. It only mentions the removal from the meeting.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union meeting in April 2025, as reported by [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/), and [JNS](https://www.jns.org/israeli-envoy-ejected-from-african-union-event-on-rwandan-genocide/), the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.
