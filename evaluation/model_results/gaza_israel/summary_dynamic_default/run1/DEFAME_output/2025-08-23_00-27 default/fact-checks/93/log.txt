Content: The Euronews article, published on July 19, 2024, discusses flight delays and cancellations. <image:4819>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/travel-chaos-as-ben-gurion-airport-briefly-shut-foreign-airlines-nix-flights/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article about travel chaos at Ben Gurion Airport, including an image of a crowded airport. <image:4820>

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there was a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, and the airport was crowded, the image provided in the claim has not been verified. The image search and web search results do not match the image in the claim. The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured)) reported on the drone attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
