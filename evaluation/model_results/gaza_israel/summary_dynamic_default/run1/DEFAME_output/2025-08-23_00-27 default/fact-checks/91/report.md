### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 58](media/91.jpg) appears in multiple sources. One source, from LBC Group ([https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en)), describes an explosion in a Tel Aviv building on July 19, 2024.

Another source, from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/)), uses the image in a live blog about the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. A third source, from India.com ([https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/](https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/)), published on October 22, 2024, reports on Hezbollah firing rockets at Tel Aviv.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack, which targeted an apartment building, was claimed by the Houthi movement. The drone was not intercepted due to human error. Another source mentions a long-range Iranian-made drone was used in the attack. ![image 58](media/91.jpg)

Additionally, the New York Times reports a missile attack by Houthi militants in Tel Aviv in December 2024. The missile landed in a playground. The Houthis claimed the attack was to aid the Palestinian people.
