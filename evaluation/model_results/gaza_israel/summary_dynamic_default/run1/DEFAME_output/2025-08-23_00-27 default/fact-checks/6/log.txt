Content: The Times of Israel reports that Benjamin Netanyahu underwent prostate removal surgery in December 2024 and was recovering in a fortified recovery ward. <image:3671>, <image:3672>, <image:3673>. The article also mentions that in November 2024, Netanyahu was in the Knesset.

Useful result: From [Source](https://cedmohub.eu/doctored-photo-does-not-show-israeli-pm-netanyahu-hospitalised-with-covid/): 
Content: The search result from AFP, published on March 8, 2024, debunks a claim that a photo shows Benjamin Netanyahu hospitalized with a mutated strain of coronavirus. The image is digitally altered, with Netanyahu's face inserted onto the body of another person. The original photo was taken in October 2015 and shows Netanyahu's wife visiting a wounded patient. <image:3675>, <image:3676>, <image:3678>.

The claim '<image:7> This is an authentic image of Benjamin Netanyahu being hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024 due to a serious health issue.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image is AI-generated and was used to falsely claim Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized, as reported by the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html) and debunked by AFP.
