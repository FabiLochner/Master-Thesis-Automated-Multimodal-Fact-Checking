Useful result: From [Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000): 
Content: The Haaretz article from July 3, 2025, by Zvi Bar'el, discusses President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and mentions events in August 2025. It does not contain information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: Based on the evidence, while Turkish President Erdogan discussed Syria with the U.S. President in March 2025, there is no supporting evidence to confirm that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel regarding its intervention in Syria. The search results from Reuters and Haaretz ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/)) do not mention such a request.

So, the overall veracity is: false
