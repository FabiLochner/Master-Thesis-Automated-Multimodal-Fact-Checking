[AP Fact Check](https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check)

Mel Gibson did not post on social media about ‘the end’ of Israel
=================================================================

             ![FILE - Mel Gibson arrives at the 89th Academy Awards Nominees Luncheon in Beverly Hills, Calif. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor’s publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the “Braveheart” star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn’t quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The “post” features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

But Alan Nierob, Gibson’s publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor “did not make the post.” Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson “doesn’t have any public social media accounts.”

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel <image:4515>

Alberto E. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

The post apparently referenced the fact that Israel had [continued to conduct airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-b084e9c453cc99f7bec6f66d7b5913d9)
 in Gaza while at the same time preparing its military for a ground assault. Further, the first few words of the caption appeared to have been a poor translation to English by the person who created the post.

While it's true that Gibson had [expressed](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
 some anti-Semitic views in the past, the post in question was fake.

Ryder called her alleged encounter with Gibson "a painful and vivid memory"

**Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder have become embroiled in a row after she claimed he made anti-Semitic comments to her.**

The actress said he referred to her as an "oven dodger" in an apparent reference to her Jewish background.

Gibson's representative said Ryder's allegations, which she made in 2010 and repeated in a recent interview with The Sunday Times, were "100% untrue".

Ryder responded by asserting again that she and a late friend had been "on the receiving end of his hateful words".

The Stranger Things actress described the alleged encounter as "a painful and vivid memory".

Ryder first made the claims [in an interview with GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/winona-ryder-forever-black-swan-star-trek)
 in 2010. [She told this weekend's Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/winona-ryder-on-turning-50-missing-keanu-reeves-and-being-saved-by-normal-people-07rppmj3t)
: "We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we're all talking and he said to my friend, who's gay, 'Oh wait, am I gonna get Aids?'

"And then something came up about Jews, and he said, 'You're not an oven dodger, are you?'"

Ryder, 48, said Gibson, 64, had tried to apologise to her at a later date.

Ryder said Gibson made the remarks to her and her late friend, make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin

The Braveheart star's representative disputed Ryder's version of events, however, accusing her of "lying" about both the alleged comments and apology.

Gibson, he claimed, "did reach out to \[Ryder\], many years ago, to confront her about her lies and she refused to address it with him".

Ryder responded by offering more details, including that the encounter occurred "around 1996".

"I believe in redemption and forgiveness and hope that Mr Gibson has found a healthy way to deal with his demons, but I am not one of them," [she said in a statement](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/winona-ryder-response-mel-gibson-anti-semitic-homophobic-1234647217/)
.

"Only by accepting responsibility for our behaviour in this life can we make amends and truly respect each other, and I wish him well on this life-long journey."

Ryder, whose father is Jewish, was born Winona Laura Horowitz in 1971.

! In the Sunday Times she said she was "not religious" but identified as Jewish.

Chicken Run sequel
------------------

It is not the only time Gibson has been accused of using the offensive term, which alludes to the mass murder of Jews in Nazi death camps during World War Two.

In 2012 screenwriter Joe Eszterhas [accused the actor](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17692563)
 of using it while they were working on a film about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee.

Gibson, who [made widely documented anti-Semitic comments](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5234142.stm)
 when he was arrested for drink-driving in 2006, called Eszterhas's claims "utter fabrications".

This week it was announced that Britain's Aardman Animations is teaming up with Netflix to make [its upcoming Chicken Run sequel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43922140)
.

It has not been confirmed whether Gibson, who voiced rooster Rocky in the 2000 original, will return to the role.

[According to The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/mel-gibson-chicken-run-role-recast-sequel/)
, however, he will not be invited back when the film goes into production next year. If you have a story suggestion email_ [entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk](mailto:entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk)

The first memorials to the victims of the [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks")
 in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of [webmasters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/webmaster "wikt:webmaster")
 posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
 Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The first reading of the names of the victims of 9/11 took place at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2002.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Names-2)

The _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ was the first major physical memorial at the [World Trade Center site](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site "World Trade Center site")
. A permanent memorial and museum, the [National September 11 Memorial & Museum](/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum "National September 11 Memorial & Museum")
 at the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
, were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with 30-foot (9.1 m) waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials have been constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was [Pier A](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Pier_A_Park "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
 in [Hoboken, New Jersey](/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey "Hoboken, New Jersey")
. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called [Hoboken Island](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Hoboken_Island "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
, was chosen in September 2004.

 in New York City from 1971 until the terrorist attacks on [September 11, 2001](/wiki/September_11,_2001 "September 11, 2001")
. The artefact, weighing more than 20 tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers after the attacks. Since then, the bronze sphere, primarily known in the United States as _The Sphere_, has been transformed into a symbolic memorial to commemorate [9/11](/wiki/9/11 "9/11")
. Having become a major [tourist attraction](/wiki/Tourist_attraction "Tourist attraction")

The [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
 was a temporary memorial at Ground Zero.

Soon after the attacks, temporary memorials were set up in New York and elsewhere.

*   On October 4, Reverend Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest, blessed the [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")

*   Also on October 13, The [September 11 Photo Project](/wiki/September_11_Photo_Project "September 11 Photo Project")
     was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community-based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historic preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled "The September 11 Photo Project" in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
*   On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture _[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
    _, formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in [Battery Park City](/wiki/Battery_Park_City "Battery Park City")
    .[\[3\]](#cite_note-Sphere-3)
    

#### In other countries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In other countries")\
\]

In Europe, annually a commemoration of September 11 to never forget, [Nissoria](/wiki/Nissoria "Nissoria")
 was one of the first public places that dedicated a memorial to September 11 in Europe. Nissoria is in a small town located in the Province of Enna in Sicily, Italy. Two family members of this community, Vincenzo DiFazio and Salvatore Lopez, died on Sept 11 at the World Trade Center.

The then-mayor Dr. Marco Murgo along with the Chiara family Benito Sr. and son Mario developed the project to dedicate a small plot of land adjacent to a local school and museum that was entitled “Parco 11 Settembre”. The Commanding Officer of the nearby U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella met with this delegation from Nissoria and embraced this truly heartfelt initiative.

Ever since its dedication, and thanks to the present-day Mayor of Nissoria Dott. Armando Glorioso and Dott. Alberto Lunetta who continues this important event, a representation of both American and Italian military personnel from the nearby Military base NAS Sigonella comes to visit and annually commemorate along with all local Italian Authorities, Dignitaries and citizens who truly will never forget this tragic event.

*   According to [Radio Farda](/wiki/Radio_Farda "Radio Farda")

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. [Zuccotti Park](/wiki/Zuccotti_Park "Zuccotti Park")
    , Liberty Street between Broadway and Church Streets. Four moments of silence were observed to commemorate the times when each plane hit and each tower fell, starting at 8:46 a.m.
*   At sunset, the _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
    _ dual search light lit the skies above New York City for the night of September 11, 2011.
*   Liquid Church[\[98\]](#cite_note-98)
     held memorial worship services in three cities in New Jersey: [Montclair](/wiki/Montclair,_New_Jersey "Montclair, New Jersey")
    , [Morristown](/wiki/Morristown,_New_Jersey "Morristown, New Jersey")
    , and [New Brunswick](/wiki/New_Brunswick,_New_Jersey "New Brunswick, New Jersey")
     on September 11, 2011, at 9:30 am and 11:30 am in each city. The church also commissioned and recorded a tribute song written by Dave Pettigrew & Frank Di Minno called, "There is Hope."
*   In Radcliff, Kentucky at the Kentucky Veteran's Cemetery Central, a committee of local citizens worked on a memorial effort taking only 8 weeks from the time of receipt of a piece of steel from the World Trade Center to the Tenth Anniversary remembrance ceremony. In that time they developed a concept design, found companies willing to donate time, labor, technical expertise, and material, and began a fundraising effort which allowed a memorial to be erected solely on private funding. This memorial completed phase I in these 8 weeks and now enters phase II. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. It was in this climate that former President [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush")
 said in a speech at the Shanksville memorial that both foreign and domestic extremists were "children of the same foul spirit", a comparison which angered some right-wing politicians and media figures. President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
, former presidents [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama")
 and [Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton")
, and their respective first ladies attended a memorial ceremony together at the [National September 11 Memorial](/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum "National September 11 Memorial & Museum")
, where the World Trade Center towers fell two decades prior. Biden then went on to visit the other two 9/11 crash sites, stopping at the national memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and finally, the Pentagon. Former President [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")

Memorial at [Fort Bragg](/wiki/Fort_Bragg "Fort Bragg")
 in 2019, featuring over 7,000 boots, representing military service members killed since the September 11 attacks

The National 9/11 Flag was made from a tattered remains of a 30-foot (9.1 m) American flag found by recovery workers in the early morning of September 12, 2001. It was hanging precariously from some scaffolding at a construction site next to Ground Zero. Because of safety reasons the flag could not be taken down until late October 2001. Charlie Vitchers, a construction superintendent for the Ground Zero cleanup effort, had a crew recover the flag. It was placed in storage for seven years.[\[109\]](#cite_note-dnainfo.com-109)

The flag has made a number of appearances across the country, including a Boston Red Sox Game, a New York Giants Home Opener, and the USS _New York_ Commissioning Ceremony. It also appeared on the CBS Evening News and on ABC World News Tonight "Persons of the Week."[\[110\]](#cite_note-110)

The flag began a national tour on Flag day, which was on June 14, 2009. It visited all 50 states where service heroes, veterans, and other honorees each added stitching and material from other retired American flags in order to restore the original 13 stripes of the flag. The flag now resides at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)
[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)
[\[113\]](#cite_note-113)

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for "learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future." The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor's POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)"To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001." (2)"To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered." (2)"To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: "This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them" The Flag of Heroes reads: " This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan's Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks.[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)
 The flags were also featured on [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")
's _[Today](/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program) "Today (American TV program)")
_[\[115\]](#cite_note-115)
 and on [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")
 affiliate [WVEC](/wiki/WVEC "WVEC")
 in Norfolk, Virginia.[\[116\]](#cite_note-116)

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

Virtual memorials
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Virtual memorials")\
\]

The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as _[Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life")
_ has led to the construction of permanent virtual memorials and exhibits. Examples include:

*   Celestial Requiem NYC (Second Life)[\[117\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-117)
     is a virtual recreation of a submitted physical memorial proposal:

> On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")

[![9/11 memorial in Israel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.israelpharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9-11-memorial.jpg)
We wanted to share something with you, something that is not widely known to many Americans (and not all Israeli’s either).  
In Israel we have a dedicated memorial to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Not only does it stand out poignantly on a hill in the middle of Israel, near Jerusalem, but the base is made out of 9/11 twin tower wreckage. It cost more than $2 million to make and was orchestrated by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).  
Unfortunately Israel knows how to build memorials and monuments. In this small country with so much turbulence, we know only too well the suffering of those who die needlessly in these terrorist attacks. This memorial is known simply as the “9/11 Memorial Plaza”.  
Here are some interesting facts about the 9/11 Memorial Plaza.

*   The memorial Plaza was completed in 2009 for $2 million, by the JNF.
*   It sits on 5 acres of hillside, 20 miles from the center of Jerusalem, not a small monument at all. It overlooks Jerusalem’s largest cemetery, Har HaMenuchot.
*   The memorial monument is in the shape of a 30-foot, bronze American flag that has been built in the shape of a flame to commemorate the flames of the Twin Towers.
*   The base is made out of melted twin tower wreckage.
*   Surrounding the main monument are plaques listing the names of all the people who died as a result of the attacks. Even though the memorial stands in Israel and only 5 Israel citizens died as a result of the attacks the memorial lists ALL the victims who perished. It is the only memorial outside the US which lists ALL of those who died in the attacks.

Times are turbulent and the entire Middle East is going through vast changes. Some say the relationship between the US and Israel is in trouble…… whatever happens, there will always be a special relationship between the US (in particular New York) and Israel.  
A powerful memorial… so the world never forgets.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The search results show that there are multiple 9/11 memorials outside the US, not just the one in Israel.


## Final Judgement
The image shows the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. However, the claim that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is false. Multiple sources confirm the existence of other 9/11 memorials outside the US.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. However, the claim that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is false, as multiple sources, such as Memorial Mapping, list other 9/11 memorials located outside the United States.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

German Reconnaissance Company

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

Two US aircraft carriers to stay in Middle East after Hezbollah attack
======================================================================

###### The Abraham Lincoln is outfitted with F-35C and F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets and will replace the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.

In addition to Lincoln, [another fighter jet squadron, and other assets have also been rushed to the region.](https://www.militarytimes.com/breaking-news/2024/08/02/us-to-boost-military-presence-in-middle-east-amid-growing-tensions/)
 The Georgia, a ballistic missile submarine, is still on its way to CENTCOM, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday.

Ryder didn’t say how long the Roosevelt would be extended or exactly when the decision was made, only saying Austin chose to do so over the weekend.

The surge seeks to provide some gray-hull deterrence after Israel launched two strikes in late July that heightened regional tensions — one in Lebanon’s capital that came in retaliation for an earlier strike from Hezbollah, and another in Tehran, killing the political leader of Hamas.

Since then, the U.S. The first came this weekend in an attack involving more than 230 rockets fired from Lebanon, [according to the Israeli military](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1828086019633406063)

The Pentagon has extended the deployment of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group after a largely failed attack by the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah on Israel over the weekend.

Choosing to keep the second carrier in the Middle East means there will now be two carriers and their warships available for U.S. Central Command amid the threat of a full regional war erupting.

The TR arrived in the Middle East in early July, while fellow carrier Abraham Lincoln steamed into the region last week.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced the decision [in a statement over the weekend.](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3883992/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)

Theodore Roosevelt replaced the carrier Dwight D. Preemptive strikes from Israel mainly thwarted the salvo, and both sides signaled that they were deescalating afterward.

When asked in a morning press conference with reporters Monday whether America’s surge in forces to the region had worked as intended, Ryder agreed.

“I think that the additional forces in the theater send a very clear message to all actors in the region that were serious when it comes to supporting the defense of Israel,” he said.

Ryder said the U.S. had helped Israel spot incoming rockets from Hezbollah but hadn’t participated in Israel’s preemptive strikes in Lebanon."

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

**Family “didn’t know”**
------------------------

As recordings of Asma Assad’s call with Sham circulated, local webpages and activists shared the recording of the father, who denied knowing Asma Assad’s phone call, saying: “I was not in the hospital at the time. , I don’t know about this call, I’ve heard of it just like you.”

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Preparing for the Possibility of a Draft Without Panic
------------------------------------------------------

Taren Sylvester and Katherine Kuzminski

August 8, 2024

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)

 alike. In August 2016, [Norway](https://warontherocks.com/2016/06/norways-gender-neutral-draft/)
 implemented a universal conscription model — including, for the first time, a requirement for women. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)

, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)

 that the nation is on a wartime footing. These concerns are unfounded, but Americans’ confusion and anxiety over the use of the draft is understandable. Was the threat existential to America’s existence, requiring the level of conflict necessary to use a draft? For many, the answer to both questions was “no.” Any use of a draft in a future conflict will require addressing the errors of Vietnam.

For several reasons, the United States actively [decided](https://www.nixonfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/The-Report-Of-The-Presidents-Commission-On-An-All-Volunteer-Armed-Force.pdf)
 to move from a mixed force of conscripts (draftees) and professional service members to the all-volunteer force in 1973. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future."

Content: "The system is designed to induct draftees within 193 days of authorization.

### No Current Plans for Reactivation

In 2024, [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/10/trump-military-draft-mandatory-service/)
 that "a cluster of influential former administration officials and GOP lawmakers ... have mused aloud about a national service mandate and other measures to remedy what they see as a 'crisis' facing the all-volunteer military." However, Donald Trump responded that it was a "ridiculous idea."

The same year, in an analysis for [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/10/military-draft-conscription-soldiers-technology-nato-europe-russia-ukraine/)
, political scientist Raphael S. It would require formal legislation passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the president.

There's no existing authority -- even for a sitting president -- to bring back the draft unilaterally without that legal action. Any attempt to bypass Congress would be unconstitutional and almost certainly trigger massive legal, political and public pushback, including court challenges.

Until that happens, registering is a precaution, not a signal that anyone's about to get called up.

### Legal Framework for Reinstating the Draft

  
Any attempt to bring back the draft would typically be in response to the declaration of a national emergency or a large-scale war that would overburden the U.S. Cohen wrote: "After decades of becoming increasingly rare, the military draft is back in the debate."

Cohen noted that, despite the fact that modern warfare often emphasizes technology and drones, many countries are reintroducing or reconsidering the military draft, because large-scale conflicts still require a significant number of people. Despite occasional public anxiety during times of global tension or military escalation, there have been no formal moves by Congress or the executive branch to bring back the draft.

What Could Trigger a Return to the Draft?
-----------------------------------------

Although returning to the draft wouldn't happen lightly or without significant cause, possible scenarios that might trigger it include:

*   A large-scale ground war that requires a big increase in troop numbers
*   Multiple military conflicts going on around the world simultaneously, stretching U.S. Simply put, people who are medically unfit, already serving, conscientious objectors (with approval) or otherwise legally exempt cannot be drafted.

If a draft were to return, those selected would undergo a classification process to determine their eligibility and to see whether there are any deferments or exemptions. The process would look something like this:

*   **Physical and Mental Assessments:** Registrants would be evaluated at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) to check their physical and mental fitness for military service.
*   **Eligibility Verification:** Factors such as age, health and legal status would be reviewed to confirm eligibility.
*   **Deferments and Exemptions:** Depending on the person, some may qualify for deferments (temporary postponements) or exemptions (permanent exclusions) from service.

Again, classification would only occur if Congress and the president decide to resume a draft. At that time, those qualified for induction would have the opportunity to file claims for exemptions, deferments and postponements from military service.

### Appeals and Conscientious Objection

  
Those who believe they should not be inducted due to personal beliefs or circumstances have avenues to appeal:

*   **Local Draft Boards:** Registrants could present their case to a local board, which will decide whether to grant or deny their claim.
*   **Appeal Process:** If the local board denies the claim, the individual could appeal to a district appeal board. If the district board were to deny the claim, and the vote wasn't unanimous, further appeal to the national appeal board would be possible.

Those whose objections are based on moral or religious grounds -- aka conscientious objectors -- could (if approved) be assigned to noncombatant roles within the military or, in some cases, to civilian service contributing to the national health, safety or interest.

For more information on conscientious objection, visit the [Conscientious Objectors](https://www.sss.gov/conscientious-objectors/)
 page on the Selective Service System's website.

You may be wondering, "What happens if you get drafted and refuse to go?" Refusing to comply with a draft order can lead to legal penalties, including fines and possible jail time.

The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question: Vote on a Draft Resolution\*
=================================================================================

This afternoon (4 June) at 4 pm EST, the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
 that was initiated by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). The draft text in blue demands an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire in Gaza; the immediate, dignified, and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups; and the immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory.

Conditions in Gaza have continued to deteriorate amid Israel’s escalating military operation following the expiry of its ceasefire agreement with Hamas in March and the country’s decision to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory. Alleging aid diversion by Hamas, Israel and the US have advanced a plan coordinated by a new private entity called the [Gaza Humanitarian Foundation](https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/wcm_upload_files/2025/05/08/BJbxp4cgel/Gaza_Humanitarian_Foundation_Overview__1_.pdf)
 (GHF) that would bypass the existing delivery architecture run by the UN and its humanitarian partners. While there was apparently some debate about the appropriate language to use in reference to certain elements—including Hamas and the release of hostages—it seems that the elected members agreed on the key provisions of a draft resolution. It seems that the US expressed reservations about the draft and made several proposals that it considered prerequisites for further engagement, including a condemnation of Hamas and expression of support for the GHF. Other P5 members apparently signalled overall support for the resolution but suggested certain revisions: France and the UK also sought language condemning Hamas, while Russia proposed several edits, including the deletion of references to the IPC report and to [resolution 2735](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4051310?ln=en&v=pdf)
 of 10 June 2024—on which Russia abstained—that welcomed the 31 May 2024 ceasefire proposal announced by the US.

As several of the proposed changes were unacceptable to other members, the E10 apparently viewed their initial draft as the most balanced reflection of positions. Despite the possibility of a US veto, however, it seems that the E10 chose to move forward with the vote as a political signal to emphasise the need for Council action as the ceasefire negotiations have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough and the humanitarian toll of the conflict continues to rise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

_\*\*Post-script:_ On 4 June, the Security Council voted on the draft resolution submitted by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). On 19 May, Israel [announced](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/904878/)
 that it would restore limited access to allow a “minimum” amount of humanitarian aid to enter the territory until a new aid delivery mechanism that Israel and the US have developed was operational.

Most Council members remain concerned about that mechanism. The GHF has begun delivering aid at designated distribution sites secured by US contractors and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)."

Throughout the war, the Israeli military has severed the north from the rest of Gaza by holding the so-called Netzarim Corridor, a belt across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. Negotiations over it are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire.

Phase two’s broad outlines are laid out in the draft: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a “sustainable calm.”

But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues.

Without a deal within those 42 days to begin the second phase, Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas – even as dozens of hostages remain in the militants’ hands.

Hamas has agreed to a draft of the ceasefire deal, two officials confirmed, but Israeli officials say details are still being worked out, meaning some terms could change, or the whole deal could even fall through. By the end of the phase, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed.

On the first official day of the ceasefire, Hamas is to free three hostages, then another four on the seventh day. Protesters said they see little hope in a “hypocritical” U.S.–backed peace plan.

## Claim
Claim: "The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war."

## Actions
```
web_search("US draft reinstituted 2024")
web_search("US military draft Israel-Hamas war")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The War on the Rocks published an article on August 8, 2024, discussing the possibility of a draft in the U.S., mentioning that conscription is being discussed among U.S. allies and adversaries. It also mentions recent proposals to automate Selective Service System registration and expand it to include all Americans, which has led to public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing. (<image:k>) Military.com states that there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024. Any attempt to bring back the draft would require legislation passed by Congress and signed by the president.
