The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified because the search results confirm Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City, as reported by the [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo), but there is no information about a baby named Sham Imad Muhareb.

So, the overall veracity is: false
