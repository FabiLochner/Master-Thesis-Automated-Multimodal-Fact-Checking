Useful result: From [Source](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/): 
Content: The Columbian reports that Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels targeted a United States-flagged container ship in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday. The captain reported an explosion near the vessel off the coast of Nishtun, Yemen. The article is dated August 22, 2025, but the events described occurred in July 2024. The article mentions the Maersk Sentosa was attacked. The article also mentions that Maersk, a Danish firm, did not immediately respond for comment.

The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While a U.S.-flagged Maersk vessel was attacked in July 2024, the attack occurred in the Arabian Sea, not the Gulf of Aden, as reported by Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-reports-nearby-explosion-east-yemens-nishtun-ukmto-says-2024-07-09/)) and VOA News ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-on-u-s--flagged-container-ship-sailing-through-arabian-sea/7692113.html)). A Maersk spokesperson confirmed the ship was U.S.-flagged.

So, the overall veracity is: false
