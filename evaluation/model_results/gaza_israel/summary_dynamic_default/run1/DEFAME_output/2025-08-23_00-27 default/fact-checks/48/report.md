Newsweek ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)) reported that Trump allegedly called Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal, but Trump and Netanyahu's office denied the call.

NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/g-s1-16958/gaza-ceasefire-talks-israel-hamas)) published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the Gaza cease-fire talks ![image 4091](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909987-759383.jpg), ![image 4092](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909989-387454.jpg), ![image 4093](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909991-227394.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)). However, the evidence also shows conflicting reports. Newsweek reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu not to make a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denied the call ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)).

The claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign is supported by a report from PBS host Judy Woodruff, as cited in the Newsweek article. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu's offices casts doubt on the claim's veracity.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to conflicting reports and denials. Further verification would require confirmation of the phone call and the specific content of the conversation.

The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6v9jx939o)) reports that Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on July 26, 2024, where Trump criticized Kamala Harris's remarks on Israel.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire.

## Final Judgement
The claim is based on reports that Trump urged Netanyahu to stop a ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris's campaign. While there are reports of the phone call and the discussion of a ceasefire, the specific details about Trump's motivations are disputed, with both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denying the report. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively verified. `false`
