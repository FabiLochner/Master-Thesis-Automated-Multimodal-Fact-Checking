Useful result: From [Source](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/): 
Content: War on the Rocks published an article on August 8, 2024, discussing the possibility of a draft in the U.S. The article mentions that conscription is being discussed among U.S. allies and adversaries. It also mentions recent proposals to automate Selective Service System registration and expand it to include all Americans, which has led to public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/will-the-military-draft-come-back): 
Content: Military.com states that there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024. The Washington Post reported that some officials have discussed a national service mandate, but Donald Trump called it a "ridiculous idea." Any attempt to bring back the draft would require legislation passed by Congress and signed by the president. The article mentions that a large-scale ground war or multiple military conflicts could trigger a return to the draft.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/06/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-vote-on-a-draft-resolution-6.php): 
Content: The Security Council Report published on June 4, 2025, discusses a draft resolution on the war between Israel and Hamas. The US vetoed the resolution. The article mentions the expiry of the ceasefire agreement in March and the decision to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory.

Useful result: From [Source](https://whyy.org/articles/draft-ceasefire-deal-israel-hamas-what-to-know/): 
Content: The article discusses a draft ceasefire deal for the Israel-Hamas war, mentioning potential issues with implementation and the release of hostages. It also mentions that Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza if a deal isn't reached within 42 days. The article was published 1 year ago by WHYY.

The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were discussions about a potential draft in the U.S. in August 2024, as reported by [War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/), there were no actual plans to reinstate it. Furthermore, [Military.com](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/will-the-military-draft-come-back) confirms that there were no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
