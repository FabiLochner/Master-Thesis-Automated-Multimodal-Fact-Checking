The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

Content: "They \[the government\] have to go,” the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza.

Until the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.

[Hezbollah in southern Lebanon](/news/2024/7/17/hezbollah-threatens-to-fire-on-new-israeli-targets)
 has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.

Following the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as “a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters”.

It said the Yemeni fighters were supporting “the heroic” Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending “all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations”.

The group said the fight will not stop until “the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”.

The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also praised the Houthi rebels for “a new heroic operation” against Israel, adding that Palestinians appreciated the “steadfast” support of Gaza.

It claimed that it used a new drone “capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being unable to be detected by radars”.

The Israeli military said it had opened an investigation into the large explosion near the United States embassy office in the city and would determine why the country’s air defence systems were not activated to intercept the “aerial target”.

“We’re talking about a large UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] that can fly large distances,” a military official told a briefing for journalists following the strike. ![People gather at the scene of an deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on July 19, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where police said one person was found dead. The site was sealed off by police tape.

Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.

aj-logo It’s a very densely populated area, a high-security area,” Jamjoom said.

If the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel’s radar systems undetected, “there’s going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means”, said Jamjoom.

“How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable “offensive response”.

Israeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was “further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel”.

“Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv. “We’re not ruling out any possibilities right now.”

Israel’s air force has increased patrols to “protect the country’s skies”, the military said in a post on social media.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised retaliation.

“We will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,” Israeli Army Radio quoted Gallant as saying.

Israeli police said the body of a man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and that the circumstances were being investigated.

Footage from the site of the blast showed broken glass strewn across pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks."

After months of conflict, tourism in Israel is recovering. There are no queues at major attractions, and you can experience the Old City, the Western Wall, and Church of the Holy Sepulchre without the usual rush.

Despite the return of airport crowds, there are ways to reduce inconveniences for those enjoying tourism in Israel right now. Our experienced drivers coordinate seamlessly with the VIP airport team, ensuring a smooth arrival or departure.

Additionally, we offer private transportation services across Israel. Is there any tourism in Israel now? International airlines have resumed flights, and Ben Gurion Airport is operating as usual with its typical crowds and queues.

However, the number of tourists remains significantly lower than before. Group tourism in Israel, in particular, will need more time to reorganise. Sites in Jerusalem that are usually crowded are now quiet. Our fast-track VIP services, available on arrival and departure at Ben Gurion Airport, save you time and stress. If you have many bags, porter service is arranged in advance.

We also provide VIP transfers with Mercedes vans to and from the airport. We also offer private tours led by experienced, licensed guides to ensure you see Israel deeply and comfortably.

**In short:**

*   Tourism in Israel is recovering slowly but steadily.
*   Private tourists benefit from quiet sites.
*   Our VIP services make travel easy, fast, and stress-free.

[![Arrivals hall at Ben Gurion Airport, on August 4, 2024. (Gavriel Fiske/ Times of Israel)

On Sunday afternoon, at the usually bustling Ben Gurion Airport arrivals hall, the crowds were noticeably sparse. He had come to the airport anyway, he said, after a regular client, “a big family,” could not arrive because of a canceled flight from Europe.

Since last week’s [double assassinations](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-braces-for-iran-attack-as-us-works-to-revive-coalition-that-foiled-april-assault/)
 of Hezbollah’s military chief Fuad Shukr in Beirut, claimed by Israel, and of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in a Tehran safe house controlled by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, an event not officially claimed by Israel, [more than 18 airlines have canceled](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iberia-express-air-europa-latest-to-join-list-of-airlines-suspending-tel-aviv-route/)
 or suspended their flights to and from Ben Gurion, in light of the potentially escalating security situation.

This has left some 100,000 Israelis stranded abroad with no quick or easy way to get home, according to a Channel 12 report from Saturday. <image:4795>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-04-at-4.42.33-PM.jpeg)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, was claimed by the Houthis, resulting in one death and multiple injuries (<image:i>). The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander. The attack on Tel Aviv was followed by an Israeli attack on Yemen on July 20, 2024, targeting Al Hudaydah, Yemen.

The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured)) reported on the drone attack. Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen)) discusses both the drone attack and the subsequent Israeli attack on Yemen.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel. One article from Haaretz, published on July 4, 2024, discusses the expected increase in passenger numbers at the airport during the summer, although still lower than pre-war levels. Another article, dated July 2025, discusses the recovery of tourism in Israel, mentioning typical crowds and queues at the airport.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, claimed by the Houthis. The web search results also mention Ben Gurion Airport. However, the provided images from the Times of Israel, dated August 4, 2024, show a different scene than the one in the claim. Therefore, I cannot confirm the claim.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, was claimed by the Houthis, resulting in one death and multiple injuries (<image:i>). The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander. The attack on Tel Aviv was followed by an Israeli attack on Yemen on July 20, 2024, targeting Al Hudaydah, Yemen.

The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured)) reported on the drone attack. Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen)) discusses both the drone attack and the subsequent Israeli attack on Yemen.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel. One article from Haaretz, published on July 4, 2024, discusses the expected increase in passenger numbers at the airport during the summer, although still lower than pre-war levels. Another article, dated July 2025, discusses the recovery of tourism in Israel, mentioning typical crowds and queues at the airport. The Times of Israel published an article on August 4, 2024, about Ben Gurion Airport, mentioning that more than 18 airlines have canceled or suspended flights. The article includes images of the arrivals and departures halls at Ben Gurion Airport on August 4, 2024. <image:4795>, <image:4797>, <image:4798>, <image:4800>.

The first article can be found here: [Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-04/ty-article/.premium/ben-gurion-airport-expects-summer-surge-in-passengers-still-below-pre-war-levels/00000190-7d33-d835-a9fb-ffbb2c030000). The second article can be found here: [Source](https://airfasttrack.com/is-there-any-tourism-in-israel-now-july-2025/). The third article can be found here: [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-war-fears-at-ben-gurion-airport-its-business-as-usual-just-less-of-it/).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, claimed by the Houthis. The web search results also mention Ben Gurion Airport. However, the provided images from the Times of Israel, dated August 4, 2024, show a different scene than the one in the claim. Therefore, I cannot confirm the claim.



# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, and the airport was mentioned in the search results, the provided image does not match the scenes described in the articles. The image's origin and context are not verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, was claimed by the Houthis, resulting in one death and multiple injuries (<image:i>). The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander. The attack on Tel Aviv was followed by an Israeli attack on Yemen on July 20, 2024, targeting Al Hudaydah, Yemen.

The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/drone-attack-on-israels-tel-aviv-leaves-one-dead-at-least-10-injured)) reported on the drone attack. Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen)) discusses both the drone attack and the subsequent Israeli attack on Yemen.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel. One article from Haaretz, published on July 4, 2024, discusses the expected increase in passenger numbers at the airport during the summer, although still lower than pre-war levels. Another article, dated July 2025, discusses the recovery of tourism in Israel, mentioning typical crowds and queues at the airport. The Times of Israel published an article on August 4, 2024, about Ben Gurion Airport, mentioning that more than 18 airlines have canceled or suspended flights. The article includes images of the arrivals and departures halls at Ben Gurion Airport on August 4, 2024. <image:4795>, <image:4797>, <image:4798>, <image:4800>.

The third article can be found here: [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-war-fears-at-ben-gurion-airport-its-business-as-usual-just-less-of-it/).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, claimed by the Houthis. The web search results also mention Ben Gurion Airport. However, the provided images from the Times of Israel, dated August 4, 2024, show a different scene than the one in the claim. Therefore, I cannot confirm the claim.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

The major talent agencies in Hollywood — UTA, CAA and WME — have all taken public stances to stand with Israel and to support Jews.

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)
 to organizations funding relief in Israel and Palestine.

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image is fake. Multiple sources confirm that the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag is fabricated, and a quote associated with the image is also fabricated.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

Variety also reported that Johnson, along with other Hollywood stars, has shown support for Israel amid the Hamas attacks ([Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/)). The sources do not show Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. <image:2699> <image:1> <image:2700>

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

One incident occurred in Hebron in 2011, and another in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, in late October 2023. The image search also provided an image of an Israeli army dog with soldiers. However, none of the provided evidence confirms the authenticity of the image in the claim, nor does it provide any information about the specific event described in the claim.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

Police said the pit bull bit a 65-year-old woman on her calf after two dogs escaped from a nearby yard.

Investigators believe the dogs belong to someone on Wayside Drive. Those dogs are now in ACS custody.

Authorities are working with the victim to build cases against the animals, for them to be deemed as 'dangerous dogs' and added to the city registry.

#### [Woman could lose arms to vicious dog attack](/video/1690799)

Family members say 62-year-old Donna Nguyen is unconscious and on a ventilator at Grady Memorial Hospital. 1 when the dogs attacked.

#### The Brief

*   *   Donna Nguyen, a 62-year-old woman, died after being attacked by dogs in Union City; she was hospitalized for nearly two weeks before passing away.
    *   Four of the five dogs involved in the attack have been euthanized, with the fifth dog remaining in the shelter; the family is calling for accountability and justice.
    *   The Fulton County Police Department is investigating the incident, and FOX 5 Atlanta has requested records of any past incidents involving the owner's address.

**UNION CITY, Ga.** - The 62-year-old woman who was attacked by dogs has died, according to the family. Of course, we want our mother to live, but we’re just hoping we’re making the right decisions," Ingram said.

The family of 62-year-old Donna Nguyen shared these images, some graphic, which show her injuries after vicious dog attack and mauling while walking along Lakeside Drive in Union City on Aug. Four of the five off-leash dogs taken into custody after the attack have been put down, according to animal control officials. 

Donna Nguyen dies at 62
-----------------------

What we know:

Family members say 62-year-old Donna Nguyen was attacked just after 11 p.m. She suffered from dog bits, scratches, and faced losing both of her arms.

Doctors notified the family on Wednesday evening, just after this story was first published, that circumstances regarding her condition had changed, and she would be placed in comfort care. 

She passed away on Thursday, the family and investigators revealed.

Union City dog mauling
----------------------

The other side:

Fulton County officials say animal control officers took three dogs into custody on Aug. 1 and the owner later surrendered two more dogs. 

Video obtained by FOX 5 shows the dogs being removed from the owner's home.

As of Thursday afternoon, four of the five dogs had been euthanized. The fifth dog remains in the shelter.

Family of Nguyen calls for accountability
-----------------------------------------

What they're saying:

Her son, Charles Ingram, speaking to FOX 5 on Wednesday, said he will never forget the phone call from the hospital.

"She explained to me that she’s been mauled and attacked by dogs," he said.

 The injuries are so severe, the family says they are too graphic to show.

"We’re just hoping we’re making the right decisions."

One incident, reported by Al-Haq on December 28, 2011, involved a dog attacking Amira Rahman ‘Awad in Hebron. The article includes a photo of the attack <image:2790>. Another incident, reported by Middle East Eye on January 6, 2025, involved a pregnant woman, Tahrir Husni al-Arian, in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, in late October 2023, which resulted in the loss of her baby. The article includes a photograph of the woman and her daughter <image:i>.
