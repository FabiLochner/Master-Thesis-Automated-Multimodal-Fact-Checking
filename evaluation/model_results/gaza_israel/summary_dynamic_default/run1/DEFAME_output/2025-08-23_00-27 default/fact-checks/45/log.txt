Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html): 
Content: The New York Post reports that Greta Thunberg was filmed giggling as she declared "f–k Germany" and "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany on Dec. <image:396>

The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: Greta Thunberg did express anti-Israel sentiments, including saying "f–k Israel" at a rally, as reported by the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and other sources. However, the evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image or the specific date (November 2024) the image was taken.

So, the overall veracity is: false
