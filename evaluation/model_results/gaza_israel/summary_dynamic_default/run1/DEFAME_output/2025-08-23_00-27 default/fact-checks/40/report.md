The New York Times also reported on the expulsion in an article published on September 25, 1936 ([https://www.nytimes.com/1936/09/25/archives/columbia-hears-plea-for-expelled-student-burke-and-two-other.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1936/09/25/archives/columbia-hears-plea-for-expelled-student-burke-and-two-other.html)) ![image 1415](media/2025-07-20_10-29-1753007361-891648.jpg).

The "Blurred Bylines" article ([https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/](https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/)) and a New York Times article ([https://www.nytimes.com/1936/09/25/archives/columbia-hears-plea-for-expelled-student-burke-and-two-other.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1936/09/25/archives/columbia-hears-plea-for-expelled-student-burke-and-two-other.html)) both corroborate this.

Additionally, Columbia Magazine confirms Burke's expulsion for participating in a mock book burning and anti-Nazi picket.
