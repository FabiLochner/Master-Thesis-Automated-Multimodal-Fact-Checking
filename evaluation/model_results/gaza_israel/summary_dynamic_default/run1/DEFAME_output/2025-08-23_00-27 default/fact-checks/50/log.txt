Useful result: From [Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/): 
Content: The article from Blaer Law, published on February 6, 2024, discusses the use of DNA testing in relation to obtaining Israeli citizenship. It states that secular Israeli authorities do not recognize DNA tests from platforms like 23andMe or Ancestry. DNA tests can be used to establish relationships for legal processes, including immigration cases. DNA testing in Israel requires permission from the Israeli court. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/): 
Content: The website states that DNA tests can be used to confirm Jewish ancestry in Israel. However, the results are only legally valid if the test is conducted pursuant to an order issued by an Israeli court and carried out in accordance with the prescribed legal procedure. DNA testing is conducted exclusively in licensed laboratories in Israel. Tests performed privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts. <image:4114>, <image:4115>, <image:4116>, <image:4117>, <image:4118>.

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: DNA tests are not illegal in Israel, but they are regulated. Legal DNA tests require permission from an Israeli court and must be conducted in licensed Israeli laboratories, as stated by sources like [blaerlaw.com](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/) and [pravoisrael.us](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/). Tests from platforms like 23andMe or Ancestry are not recognized by secular Israeli authorities.

So, the overall veracity is: false
