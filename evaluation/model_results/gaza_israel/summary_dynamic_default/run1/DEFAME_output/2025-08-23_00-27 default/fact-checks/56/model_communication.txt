The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
. The Iran-backed political party and militant group holds Israel responsible for the [strikes that killed at least 29 persons and injured around 2,800 people](/en/lebanon-explosions-stoke-fear-of-hezbollah-retaliation/a-70261978)
.

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim:** "An iPhone was also blown up in Lebanon", [a social media user wrote on X](https://archive.ph/yYA3i "External link — a social media user wrote on X")
 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a destroyed iphone is not related to the current attacks in LebanonImage: X

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")
we find both images: [The image on the left](https://perma.cc/6TAZ-EPZ9 "External link — The image on the left")
, showing burning solar panels, dating back to[an X-post](https://x.com/FSRI_org/status/1215631166226817024 "External link — an X-post")
 from February 2020. In the post, the US-American Fire Safety Research Institute shared an article about the safety of photovoltaic systems along with the image.

The second photo shows a burning house [dates back to December 2020](https://www.saobserver.net/news/update-westside-home-fire-a-total-loss-not-suspicious-3723448 "External link — dates back to December 2020")
. The fire incident took place in Canada and not in Lebanon.

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

If you want to know more about how the explosions in Lebanon happened technically, DW Science explains it [in this article](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)

[!Not just pagers: iPhones, laptops, electronic locks and other devices exploded in Lebanon today <image:343>](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo_2024-09-18_18-09-13.jpg)

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_7420.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7420.mp4)

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/video\_2024-09-18\_17-50-16.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/video_2024-09-18_17-50-16.mp4)

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_8469.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_8469.mp4)

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

​​​​​**GAZA CITY, Palestine/ISTANBUL**   

The Israeli army has killed at least 56 people in attacks across the Gaza Strip on Friday, with the besieged enclave losing another Palestinian baby to starvation, according to medics.

In the latest attack, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in al-Tuffah neighborhood in eastern Gaza City.

Another Palestinian was killed and several others were injured in an Israeli strike that targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in the Al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.

Three more Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on the Jabalia al-Nazla area of northern Gaza, while a fourth Palestinian was killed and several others were wounded in another strike that targeted people waiting for aid near al-Khalidi Mosque in the northwest of Gaza City.

Moreover, one Palestinian was killed in an Israeli strike near Hamad City, northwest of Khan Younis.

Medical sources told Anadolu that 18 people, including women and children, were killed and dozens injured when Israeli artillery shelled a school sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians in the Sheikh Ridwan neighborhood of Gaza City.

Five members of a family, including three children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent for displaced people in the same neighborhood.

The bodies of four Palestinians were retrieved under the rubble of a house destroyed in a previous Israeli strike in the Zeitoun and Sabra neighborhoods of Gaza City.

Another Palestinian was killed in the Tuffah neighborhood, as another woman lost her life in an Israeli drone strike in the Shujaiya neighborhood.

The Israeli army targeted a residential building in the Shati refugee camp in western Gaza City, killing a Palestinian couple and their two daughters.

Israeli aircraft also struck a group of civilians in the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza City, resulting in the death of a mother and son, while another strike on a house in the same area killed and injured several others.

The Israeli army carried out intense bombardment in the vicinity of a medical center and a mosque in the Sabra neighborhood.

In the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed and five others injured when two Israeli drones targeted a residential apartment in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

**Attack on civilians seeking aid**

The Israeli army opened fire on civilians waiting for aid delivery in the southern Gaza Strip, killing three people.

Five more were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent near a university building in Khan Younis.

The Israeli army hit a water desalination plant in the Asdaa city of Khan Younis, killing two people and injuring others among displaced civilians waiting to receive water.

Several Palestinians were also injured in an Israeli strike that targeted an abandoned house in the Khan Younis refugee camp.

A 5-month-old Palestinian baby died of starvation and malnutrition in the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, medics told Anadolu.

According to medics, starvation and severe malnutrition worsened the health of the baby, who had been suffering from congenital diseases, including atrophy, encephalitis (brain inflammation), and cerebral palsy.

Gaza’s Health Ministry said at least 271 people, including 112 children, died of starvation and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip since October 2023.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Friday that famine in Gaza, deliberately created by the Israeli government, is confirmed, after also being formally confirmed by the UN-backed global hunger monitoring system IPC.

Israel has killed nearly 62,300 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023. The military campaign has devastated the enclave, which is facing famine.

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Israeli strike on Gaza residential building kills 29, medics say

Dozens of people were also wounded in the strike on a multi-storey building in Gaza City's Shejaiya neighbourhood

At least 29 Palestinians, including children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a multi-storey residential building in the east of Gaza City, a local hospital says.

The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said warplanes targeted the area near al-Hawashi mosque in the Shejaiya neighbourhood on Tuesday morning.

It initially reported that 23 people were killed but warned its first responders were searching for two dozen others under the rubble. Do they fire rockets at the Israeli army?" an elderly man in Shejaiya told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.

Israel's military said the strike targeted a senior Hamas figure

Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 33 people had been killed in Israeli attacks over the previous 24 hours.

That brought the reported total of those killed since Israel resumed its air and ground campaign against Hamas on 18 March to 1,482.

The Israeli military meanwhile said its aircraft had struck more than 45 "terror targets" across Gaza over the past day, including weapons manufacturing sites and rocket launchers.

It also said ground forces were advancing into Shejaiya as well as the so-called "Morag Corridor" in southern Gaza.

The military corridor is being established by seizing territory between the city of Rafah, whose residents have been ordered to evacuate, and neighbouring Khan Younis.

During a visit to the area on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said: "We are now slicing through the strip, and we are increasing the pressure step by step, so that they \[Hamas\] will give us our hostages." ​

"All of Rafah will be evacuated and turned into a security area. This is what we are doing now," he added, [according to the Ynet news website](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1v6d4vryx)
.

The BBC has asked the Israeli military for comment.

Another 390,000 people have been displaced over the past three weeks, with two-thirds of the territory now designated by the Israeli military as "no-go" zones or placed under evacuation orders, according to the UN.

The UN has also warned that supplies of food, medicine and fuel have dried up because Israel has prevented any deliveries of humanitarian aid for a month to put pressure on Hamas.

On Tuesday, Secretary General António Guterres condemned the Israeli blockade, saying it violated international law and had opened "the floodgates of horror".

"Gaza is a killing field and civilians are in an endless death loop," he added.

The Israeli foreign ministry rejected Guterres' criticism, saying he had "not let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel".

"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip - over 25,000 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip in the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine," spokesman Oren Marmonstein said.

On Monday, the heads of six UN humanitarian agencies had described Israel's assertion there was enough food for Gaza's 2.1 million population as "far from reality on the ground".

They called for the protection of civilians, the facilitation of aid deliveries, the release of the hostages held by Hamas, and the renewal of the ceasefire.

Mediators are continuing to try to resurrect the ceasefire, which started on 19 January and saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages - eight of them dead - and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.

Israel said it resumed its offensive due to Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the ceasefire deal's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Hamas accused Israel of violating the original agreement, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end.

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

More than 50,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

_Correction 10 April 2025: This article originally said the Israeli defence minister was quoted by the Jerusalem Post. In fact, he was quoted by the Ynet website and we have amended this sentence to make that clear._

GAZA, Monday, July 8 2024 (WAFA) – Four Palestinian civilians today were killed in an Israeli airstrike on al-Shujaiya neighborhood, east of Gaza City.

Local sources reported that the occupation warplanes targeted a group of civilians in al-Shuja'iya neighborhood, resulting in the killing of four civilians and the wounding of others.

Meanwhile, Israeli warships fired heavy machine-gun fire at the fishermen’s vicinity, west of Gaza City.

The occupation artillery bombed Khirbet al-Adas area, north of the city of Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, wounding 11 civilians.

The ongoing Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023 has so far resulted in the documented killing of 38,153 Palestinians and injuries to 87,828 others.

Thousands are also believed trapped under rubble and in the streets, inaccessible to ambulance and civil defense crews.

Israel declares ‘state of war’ after Hamas militants launch surprise attack from Gaza (videos)

Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel  on Saturday morning, October 7 in a surprise assault as several gunmen crossed into different Israeli towns while a heavy barrage of rockets are fired from the Gaza Strip.

As at press time, warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem.

At least 40 people have been killed since Hamas launched the surprise attack on Israel, the country’s emergency service said.

Another 779 people have been wounded, according to the Israeli Health Ministry.

  
Israel’s military said it was on a war footing and the defense minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a “grave mistake” by declaring war on Israel, in retaliation, Israeli military launched air strikes into Gaza.

  
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said Hamas had “launched a war against the State of Israel”. Israeli “troops are fighting against the enemy at every location”, he said.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313160-1696661234669-gettyimages-1711150149-20090101231007-911-002189_1696674381.jpeg)

  
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.

> “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel’s police chief said there were “21 active scenes” in southern Israel.

  
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of war ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

  
Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313161-1696664544161-gettyimages-1711245488-AFP_33XP63Y_1696674371.jpeg)

  
“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from a Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said militants had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.

>   
> “They just came in again, please send help,” she said. “There are a lot of homes harmed … My husband is holding the door closed … They are firing rounds of bullets.”

Palestinian media reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.

  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in  a speech this morning said the country was in war. His office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours.

  
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.

  
“We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,” said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.

  
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

After massive rocket fire in Southern Israel, Armed Palestinians were reportedly seen on the streets of Israel<br><br>  <br>Source: _MuhammadSafZal_  <br>  <br><br>> Palestinian fighters have infiltrated areas of southern Israel as a barrage of rockets launched from the Gaza Strip killed at least one woman and injured 15 others, according to Israeli medical workers.  <br>>   <br>> The rocket fire began from multiple locations in Gaza starting at 06:30 am local time (03:30 GMT) on Saturday and continued for nearly half an hour, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported.  <br>>   <br>> Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, announced the start of a military operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.  <br>>   <br>> Deif said the rockets fired marked the start of “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm”, according to reports. “We’ve decided to say enough is enough,” Deif said as he urged all Palestinians to confront Israel.  <br>>   <br>> “This is the day of the greatest battle \[to\] end the last occupation,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.  <br>>   <br>> Israel’s military told Israelis living around the Gaza Strip to stay in their homes and warned that Hamas “will pay heavy price for its actions”.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli media reported that armed fighters had opened fire on passersby in the town of Sderot, in southern Israel, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show clashes in city streets.  <br>>   <br>> Videos posted on social media showed what appeared to be uniformed Palestinian fighters inside the Israeli border town of Sderot. Another video appeared to a crowd of Palestinian men dancing around and on top of a burning Israeli tank. The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to meet with his top security officials on Saturday morning.  <br>>   <br>> Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the “element of surprise” in the early morning attack which appeared to involve Palestinian fighters in trucks inside Israel and on paragliders, in addition to the rocket fire, will leave Israelis “shocked and stunned”.<br><br>  <br>[SOURCE](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports)<br><br>**10 Likes** **3 Shares**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740638_img20231007063148_jpeg0756aad4954d77978ecd178fbbf6930c)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740639_screenmaster20231007063416_jpeg8a2723256f4e323049af97dfa8770b6f)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740640_img20231007064058_jpeg7dcde991e6026c7a8397b6e3a5f2cf93)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740641_img20231007064203_jpeg6ab49057eb636386ec9a67b195b39b00) |

| I want to believe no terrorist will moan when the mighty hand of Israel hit them hard. I've always said it, these religious lot are nothing but a bunch of barbarians. Give 'em an inch and they'll sink your country like the Titanic. Just look at what's been going on up north in Nigeria. The whole point of their religion seems to be causing trouble and chaos, so it's no surprise that their followers are just as bad.  <br>  <br>They're a bunch of hypocrites, aren't they? They blow things up, run and hide, then come out crying when the Israelis strike back. They use civilians as human shields, the bloody cowards! It's like they have no shame. All they know how to do is make trouble, then play the victim when things go south. They're a bunch of chancers, the lot of them. Bloody cowards!  <br>  <br>I 'ope these ruddy terrorists know that the Israelis don't muck about when it comes to lookin' out for their own. If any of their Yank cousins got caught up in it, it'd be a right proper problem for them. I think they've forgotten about what happened in Munich, and the consequences after that. This could be right nasty, if you get my drift.

    **আল-কাসসামের সফল অপারেশন: খান ইউনিসে ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের দুটি ট্যাংক ধ্বংস**
    
    ! <image:4221>
    
      
      
      
      
    ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা ও অত্যাচারের বিরুদ্ধে ফিলিস্তিনি মুজাহিদদের সংগ্রাম অব্যাহত রয়েছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস তাদের সর্বশেষ অপারেশনে ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক ধ্বংস করেছে। খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় সংঘটিত এই অপারেশনে ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও সাইড আইইডি ব্যবহার করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীদের উপর কঠোর প্রতিশোধ নেওয়া হয়েছে।  
      
    আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবার এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে যে তাদের যোদ্ধারা কেন্দ্রীয় খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক লক্ষ্য করে দুটি ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও একটি সাইড আইইডি’র বিস্ফোরণ ঘটিয়ে সেগুলো সফলভাবে ধ্বংস করেছে। এই অপারেশনটি গাজা উপত্যকায় ইসরায়েলের অব্যাহত গণহত্যা, ধ্বংসযজ্ঞ ও মানবতাবিরোধী অপরাধের জবাব হিসেবে পরিচালিত হয়েছে।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনী ২০২৩ সাল থেকে গাজায় নৃশংস হামলা চালাচ্ছে। আন্তর্জাতিক আদালতের রায় উপেক্ষা করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীরা গাজায় অবরোধ দিয়ে, খাদ্য ও ওষুধের সংকট সৃষ্টি করে মানবিক বিপর্যয় ডেকে এনেছে। এমনকি বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা (WHO) ও জাতিসংঘ বারবার সতর্ক করেও ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা বন্ধ করতে পারেনি।  
      
    এই পরিস্থিতিতে আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের মতো ফিলিস্তিনি প্রতিরোধ গ্রুপগুলোর অপারেশন ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের জন্য ক্রমাগত চ্যালেঞ্জ হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে। গত জুলাই মাসেও আল-কাসসাম ও আল-কুদস ব্রিগেডস যৌথভাবে ইসরায়েলি সেনাদের ওপর মর্টার হামলা চালিয়ে যানবাহন ধ্বংস করেছিল।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর নৃশংসতা যতই বাড়ছে, ফিলিস্তিনি জনগণের প্রতিরোধের চেতনা ততই শাণিত হচ্ছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবারের সফল অপারেশন প্রমাণ করে যে, অন্যায়ের বিরুদ্ধে সংগ্রাম কখনই থামানো যায় না। ইসরায়েলের অভ্যন্তরে বেড়ে চলেছে হতাশা নেতৃত্বহীনতার অভিযোগ। যুদ্ধের সময় যত গড়াচ্ছে, ততই স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠছে—যারা একদিন দখল নিতে এসেছিল, তারা আজ নিজেরাই দিশেহারা।

    **কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে যুগান্তকারী বাণিজ্য সহযোগিতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া**
    
    ! <image:4223>
    
      
      
    দ্বিপক্ষীয় অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক জোরদার করতে কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে একটি ব্যাপক অর্থনৈতিক পদক্ষেপ হাতে নিয়েছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তান। এই উদ্দেশ্যে একটি বিস্তারিত রোডম্যাপ প্রণয়ন ও সমঝোতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে উভয় পক্ষ। সম্প্রতি ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শিল্প ও বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রী নূরুদ্দিন আজিজি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ’র কিরগিজস্তান সফরকালে এই চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এই সময় বাণিজ্য সম্পর্ক সম্প্রসারণ ও ব্যবসায় বাধা অপসারণ করতে কিরগিজ প্রতিনিধিদের সাথে ব্যাপক আলোচনা উপস্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এছাড়া যৌথ বাণিজ্য কাউন্সিল গঠন, নিয়মিত বৈঠক আয়োজন এবং অগ্রগতি পর্যবেক্ষণের জন্য একটি যৌথ ওয়ার্কিং গ্রুপ গঠনের বিষয়ে উক্ত সভায় আলোচনা হয়েছে।  
      
    ট্রেড হাউস ও বাণিজ্যিক কেন্দ্র চালু করা, অর্থনৈতিক ফোরাম, প্রদর্শনী এবং আফগানিস্তানে যৌথ বিনিয়োগ সম্প্রসারণের পরিকল্পনা উত্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    দ্বিপাক্ষিক ট্রানজিট করিডোর, বাণিজ্য ও ট্রানজিট উন্নয়ন চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর এবং উজবেকিস্তান ও তাজিকিস্তানকে জড়িত করে ত্রিপক্ষীয় সহযোগিতায় কাজ করতে উভয়ে সম্মত হয়েছে।  
      
    নতুন এই চুক্তিতে কিরগিজ প্রশাসনের পক্ষ থেকে আফগান ব্যবসায়ীদের বাণিজ্যিক ভিসা, ব্যাংকিং সংযোগ ও পরিবহন রুট সহজতর করার প্রতিশ্রুতি রয়েছে।  
      
    আফগানিস্তান দক্ষিণ এশিয়া, মধ্য এশিয়া এবং মধ্য প্রাচ্যকে সংযোগকারী ট্রানজিট হাব হয়ে উঠার প্রবল সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে। তাই কৌশলগত অবস্থানকে কাজে লাগিয়ে মধ্য এশিয়ার রাষ্ট্রগুলোতে বাণিজ্য সম্প্রসারণ করছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া।  
      
    উক্ত সমঝোতা স্মারক দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কের ক্ষেত্রে একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য মাইলফলক হিসেবে অভিহিত করেছেন উভয় পক্ষ। এর মাধ্যমে উভয় দেশের মধ্যে ব্যবসা বৃদ্ধি ও অর্থনৈতিক সংহতির পথ প্রশস্ত হবে বলে প্রত্যাশা করা হচ্ছে।

    **আমেরিকার প্রচারিত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে রাজনৈতিক সুর বিদ্যমান: জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ**
    
    ! <image:4228>
    
      
      
    ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তানে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সরাসরি উপস্থিতি নেই, তারা আফগানিস্তান সম্পর্কে প্রত্যক্ষ জ্ঞানও রাখে না, তা সত্ত্বেও মানবাধিকার ইস্যুতে নিজেদের ইচ্ছে মতো মূল্যায়ন প্রকাশ করে যাচ্ছে ওয়াশিংটন। মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্র দপ্তরের মানবাধিকার বিষয়ক বার্ষিক প্রতিবেদনের প্রতিক্রিয়ায় এসব মন্তব্য করেন ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার মুখপাত্র জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ।  
      
    উক্ত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে দাবি করা হয়, তালিবান সরকারের অধীনে আফগানিস্তানে মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষা উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে হ্রাস পেয়েছে। নারী অধিকার ও মত প্রকাশের স্বাধীনতা লঙ্ঘিত হয়েছে।  
      
    জবাবে মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ বলেন, আফগানিস্তানে কোনও মার্কিন দূতাবাস নেই। তাই তাদের পক্ষে আফগানিস্তানের বাস্তবতা, অগ্রগতি বা মানবাধিকারের বিষয়গুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করা চলে না। এই প্রতিবেদনগুলোর সাথে রাজনৈতিক উদ্দেশ্য জড়িত, অধিকাংশ প্রতিবেদন ষড়যন্ত্রের হাতিয়ার হিসেবে প্রকাশ করা হয়ে থাকে।  
      
    তিনি জোর দিয়ে বলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উচিত মার্কিন দখলদারিত্বের সময়ের সাথে আফগানিস্তানের বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি তুলনা করা, মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে কোন সময়কালটি অধিক উত্তম সেটা তারা অনুধাবন করুক।  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, আফগান ইস্যু নিয়ে আমেরিকার উদ্বিগ্ন হওয়া উচিত নয়, কেননা নাগরিকদের অধিকার সম্পর্কে বর্তমান সরকার অবগত আছে। আফগানিস্তানের একটি একটি ধর্মীয় ও আইনি দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি রয়েছে, নাগরিকদের অধিকার নিশ্চিত করতে এখানে ধর্মীয় বাধ্যবাধকতা রয়েছে।

    **ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার চার বছরের অর্জন: সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক দু’ক্ষেত্রেই বিজয়**
    
    ! <image:4231>
    
      
      
      
    আফগানিস্তানে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শাসন পুনঃপ্রতিষ্ঠার চার বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। এ উপলক্ষে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার কর্মকর্তারা সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রে নিজেদের অর্জনের ওপর আলোকপাত করেছেন।  
      
    গত ১৩ আগস্ট কাতারে অবস্থিত ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার দূতাবাসের ভারপ্রাপ্ত প্রধান সুহাইল শাহিন হাফিযাহুল্লাহ জানান, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার বিজয় অর্জনের ফলে শত্রুদের রাজনৈতিক ও কৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ব্যর্থ হয়েছে এবং দেশের প্রশাসনিক কাঠামো আরও মজবুত হয়েছে।  
      
    তিনি বলেন, ‘এই বিজয়ের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া শুধু সামরিক নয়, রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রেও সফলতা অর্জন করেছে। এই উদ্যোগ আফগানিস্তানে ইসলামি শাসন প্রতিষ্ঠার পথকে সুগম করেছে।’  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার সদস্যদের প্রচেষ্টা ও আফগান জনগণের ত্যাগের কারণে বিশ্ব শক্তি ও তাদের মিত্ররা পরাজিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এর আগে, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার জ্যেষ্ঠ নেতা আনাস হাক্কানি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ দোহা চুক্তিকে আফগানিস্তানে আমেরিকার পরাজয়ের লিখিত স্বীকৃতি হিসেবে বর্ণনা করেন। তিনি বলেন, চুক্তির মাধ্যমে আমেরিকা ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তর করতে বাধ্য হয়েছিল, যদিও শুরুতে তারা আলোচনা এড়িয়ে গিয়েছিল। হাক্কানি জানান, তালিবান পারস্পরিক সমঝোতার মাধ্যমে ক্ষমতায় আসতে চাইলেও সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট আশরাফ ঘানির হঠাৎ পলায়ন সেই পরিকল্পনায় পরিবর্তন আনে।

**Residents say there has been heavy fighting in Jabalia in northern Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops are conducting a new ground operation.**

The Israeli military said it had killed 20 “terrorists” there over the past day, and that one of its soldiers had also been killed in the north.

Hamas said its fighters had targeted Israeli forces in Jabalia and its refugee camp, while the Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli strikes had killed 19 people.

Civilians in Jabalia and nearby Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia have been told to evacuate south by the military, which said on Sunday that intelligence indicated Hamas was trying to “rebuild its operational capabilities” in the region.

It warned that the operation would involve “systematic strikes and the radical destruction of terrorist structures”.

Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday evening that Israeli forces were besieging the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia and that it would run out of fuel within hours.

It also said patients and medical personnel had been asked to evacuate the hospital, as well as the nearby Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.

Israeli forces launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken as hostages.

More than 41,960 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry

This is the third time Israeli forces have gone into Jabalia and its refugee camp over the past year, with [the last operation in May displacing tens of thousands of people, killing hundreds and causing widespread destruction](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cl44v6e8461o)
.

On Monday, Jabalia resident Asmaa Tayeh told the BBC that [she and her family had had to leave their home for the fourth time in a year](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c728vj21qepo)
.

They have returned to her grandparents’ house in the al-Nasr district of Gaza City and, like many civilians in the north, are reluctant to move south, fearing that if they do they will not ever make it home.

Despite Israeli assurances, Palestinians fear the military is planning to implement a plan, proposed by the former head of Israel’s national security council, to completely empty northern Gaza of the 300,000 to 500,000 civilians believed to be living there.

According to Giora Eiland’s plan, the north would then be declared a “closed military zone” and the estimated 5,000 Hamas fighters there would be put under siege in order to force the group to release the remaining Israeli hostages.

“The situation is getting so dangerous that we don’t have so much hope that we’ll go back,” Asmaa said.

The Israeli military also ordered civilians in parts of the southern city of Khan Younis to evacuate after Hamas fired rockets towards Israel from there on Monday, lightly wounding two women in Kfar Chabad in central Israel.

In central Gaza, the civil defence agency said 17 people, including children, were killed when a three-storey home in Bureij refugee camp was hit in an Israeli strike overnight.

Medics at a hospital in nearby Nuseirat refugee camp confirmed the death toll, according to AFP news agency.

The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas operatives in the camp and that it “conducted a precise strike on a structure from which a terrorist cell planned terror activities”.

, it had yet to be hit by Israeli jets.

The camp, just north of the city of the same name, was established in 1948. As well as the large open market at its centre, there were restaurants and schools, two football teams, bakeries and clinics.

Between 10.30am and 11.30am on 9 October last year, five Israeli airstrikes tore through the market, killing dozens of people.

[Aftermath of an airstrike in al-Trans area on 9 October 2023](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops2.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops2.mp4)

They were the opening salvoes of a devastating Israeli campaign, conducted in three waves, that has left the camp an unrecognisable wasteland of rubble.

“This year is one of the worst I have experienced,” said 33-year-old Ahlam al-Tlouli, who comes from the Tal al-Zaatar area of the camp. The deadliest, on 31 October, [killed scores of people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/jabalia-camp-airstrike-gaza)
 and left large craters in the ground at a busy junction.

Israel said the camp was a command centre for Hamas’s northern brigade and that it had identified Hamas tunnel systems under the camp. In late January, Israel withdrew from the camp.

‘All the houses were in ruins’
------------------------------

**The second offensive: May 2024**

Intermittent clashes continued throughout January despite Israeli claims that Hamas had been defeated in Jabaliya. This footage from April shows damage to buildings along two roads in the camp.

[Damaged buildings in Jabaliya refugee camp.](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops4.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops4.mp4)

On 11 May the IDF reported that Hamas had managed to reconstitute its military capabilities, and it issued a new round of evacuation orders to civilians. We passed through the centre of the camp next to the main market, along Awda Street to the Khadamat football club.”

By the time Israeli troops had withdrawn three weeks later – once again claiming to have dismantled Hamas – it was reported that 70% of the camp’s buildings had sustained heavy damage. “No house, person, tree or stone was spared.”

‘Jabaliya is like hell’
-----------------------

**The third offensive: October 2024 – ongoing**

The heavy damage inflicted on Jabaliya during the second offensive paled in comparison with the destruction levelled since 5 October, when Israeli forces returned in large numbers for a third time.

Over the course of the offensive – which targeted Jabaliya city as well as the camp – whole groupings of buildings have been demolished, replaced in some areas by bulldozed lanes to accommodate Israeli armour and tank berms. It has an awful momentum.”

Other observers detect a more deliberate agenda in Jabaliya and across northern Gaza: the slow enactment of a scorched earth policy known as the “generals’ plan”, aimed at driving out civilians from areas by declaring them “closed military zones” where anyone who stays is considered a combatant and all aid and other supplies are cut.

Regardless of the intention, whole-scale destruction of neighbourhoods has taken place across the north of Gaza, including in the camp.

[Satellite image of Jabaliya refugee camp from 12 Nov 2024](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/jabaliya_12-nov-2023_tue_final/giv-4559UcmYNSAvUq79)

A document circulated to Israeli combat soldiers in recent weeks, [revealed by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-11-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-gearing-up-to-remain-in-gaza-until-end-of-2025-at-least-this-is-what-it-looks-like/00000193-2230-d76d-a7db-637196a00000)
, talks of “exposing large areas” – a euphemism, the paper says, for destroying buildings and infrastructure in such a way that Hamas fighters cannot hide in them but no one can live in them either.

Nadia Hardman, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said HRW had identified a pattern in Jabaliya and across the north of Israeli forces clearing territory for buffer zones and security corridors.

“People can argue whether the campaign of bombing is reckless destruction or part of the hostilities, but taking control of an area and intentionally destroying it looks far more systematic,” Hardman said.

In a statement, the IDF said: “The IDF is currently operating in northern Gaza against terrorist targets due to Hamas’s efforts to restore its operational capabilities in the area … The IDF targets only military objectives. “Homes, streets, health and educational facilities – everything is gone.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was heavy fighting in Jabalia, northern Gaza, involving Israeli tanks and troops, as well as Hamas fighters. The BBC reported on this on October 8, 2024. The Guardian reported on the destruction of the Jabalia refugee camp by Israeli forces, with the third offensive starting on October 5, 2024.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024. While the evidence confirms fighting in Jabalia involving Israeli tanks and Hamas fighters in October 2024, it does not explicitly confirm that the tank in the image was ambushed by Hamas, nor does it confirm the destruction of multiple vehicles or casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the specific details about the ambush, the number of vehicles destroyed, and casualties are not confirmed. More information is needed to verify these specific details.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms fighting in Jabalia involving Israeli tanks and Hamas fighters in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the tank in the image was ambushed by Hamas, nor does it confirm the destruction of multiple vehicles or casualties.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024. While the evidence confirms fighting in Jabalia involving Israeli tanks and Hamas fighters in October 2024, it does not explicitly confirm that the tank in the image was ambushed by Hamas, nor does it confirm the destruction of multiple vehicles or casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the specific details about the ambush, the number of vehicles destroyed, and casualties are not confirmed. More information is needed to verify these specific details.

The new evidence provides additional context. Sky News published a video showing a burning tank after a Hamas attack. This supports the claim that Hamas fighters targeted Israeli tanks. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact location, the number of vehicles destroyed, or the casualties.

Three partially functioning hospitals treating severely wounded patients and sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza are now out of service after coming under intense Israeli fire, a Gaza health official told Al Jazeera, as [the siege on Jabalia](/news/2024/10/12/several-killed-in-israeli-strikes-on-northern-gazas-jabalia)
 enters its third week, with at least 33 more people killed in the northern area.

[Israeli forces](/news/liveblog/2024/10/19/live-israeli-attack-kills-at-least-33-in-north-gazas-jabalia-refugee-camp)
 bombed al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia early on Saturday, and have also shelled Kamal Adwan and the Indonesian hospitals in Beit Lahiya over the past few hours, Al Jazeera correspondents have reported.

“We cannot count the number of those killed. They said that the smell of death is in every corner of the Jabalia refugee camp,” he added.

“We have to remember that Jabalia is already under a crippling siege with no food and water entering the area for the 15th day now,” Abu Azzoum said.![INTERACTIVE-LIVE-TRACKER-GAZA_1400GMT-2024_1080x1350](/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/INTERACTIVE-LIVE-TRACKER-GAZA_LEBANON-OCT16_2024_1400GMT-2024_1080x1350-GAZA-1729263613.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C963&quality=80)

Communications and internet services had also been completely been cut off, disrupting rescue operations, he said, adding that Israeli forces have been advancing further into the centre of Jabalia and fighting with Hamas forces.

Meanwhile, Palestinian authorities warned the death toll from the latest strikes on Jabalia could rise, as some people were believed to be still trapped under the rubble.

The Palestinian official news agency, Wafa, said children were among the 33 confirmed dead. At least 85 others were wounded, some critically, raising fears of more fatalities.

The Israeli military said its operation in Jabalia is intended to stop Hamas fighters regrouping for more attacks. The numbers are terrifying,” the official told Al Jazeera.

At least one person has been killed and several others were wounded in the strike at the entrance of the laboratory of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.

The Palestinian news agency Wafa also reported that because of the military siege, two intensive care unit patients at the Indonesian Hospital have died on Saturday.

In another Israeli attack on central Gaza’s Maghazi refugee camp, at least 16 people were killed, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said on Saturday, adding that there are still missing people under the rubble.

At least seven people were also reported killed in a separate Israeli strike on a school sheltering Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp, just west of Jabalia. In Jabalia itself, an air strike on Saturday afternoon killed five more people.

Another four people were reported killed in another Israeli strike in al-Nuseirat refugee camp, according to our Al Jazeera team from Gaza.

In Rafah city, southern Gaza Strip, two people were killed in an Israeli drone airstrike on the Khirbet area.

In all, the death toll has surpassed the 67 killed in [Israeli attacks across Gaza](/tag/israel-palestine-conflict/)
 in the last 24 hours, as earlier reported by health authorities in the enclave. At least 450 have been killed since the siege began two weeks ago.

Al Jazeera’s Tarek Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said witnesses in northern Gaza told him the second and third floors of the Indonesian Hospital, as well as its courtyard, have been hit, resulting in “a number of casualties”.

At least 40 patients are trapped inside the hospital and Israeli tanks have surrounded it, he said.

Meanwhile, the attack on al-Awda Hospital cut power to the medical facility. Witnesses also told Abu Azzoum the situation in other parts of Jabalia had “severely deteriorated” since Friday.

“They said that they are surrounded by Israeli tanks and that destruction is everywhere."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:34>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, including airstrikes and sieges, starting on October 9, 2023, and continuing through May 2024. The BBC reported on heavy fighting in Jabalia, northern Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops are conducting a new ground operation, with the Israeli military stating they killed 20 "terrorists" there, while Hamas claimed its fighters targeted Israeli forces. The article mentions an Israeli evacuation order from October 6, 2024. The Guardian published an article on December 18, 2024, discussing the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza by Israeli forces, mentioning three offensives, with the third one starting on October 5, 2024, and ongoing.

The BBC article was published on October 8, 2024. The Guardian article includes satellite images and videos showing the destruction. The IDF stated that they target only military objectives. <image:34>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was heavy fighting in Jabalia, northern Gaza, involving Israeli tanks and troops, as well as Hamas fighters. The BBC reported on this on October 8, 2024. The Guardian reported on the destruction of the Jabalia refugee camp by Israeli forces, with the third offensive starting on October 5, 2024.

The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024. While the evidence confirms fighting in Jabalia involving Israeli tanks and Hamas fighters in October 2024, it does not explicitly confirm that the tank in the image was ambushed by Hamas, nor does it confirm the destruction of multiple vehicles or casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the specific details about the ambush, the number of vehicles destroyed, and casualties are not confirmed. More information is needed to verify these specific details.

Al Jazeera published an image of Israeli tanks. <image:4273> Sky News published a video showing a burning tank after a Hamas attack. <image:4274> ABC News includes an image of Israeli tanks. <image:4276>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context. Sky News published a video showing a burning tank after a Hamas attack. This supports the claim that Hamas fighters targeted Israeli tanks. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact location, the number of vehicles destroyed, or the casualties.

 on Israel -- the deadliest in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Israeli military says its operation in Jabalia is intended to stop Hamas fighters regrouping for more attacks.

Residents said Israeli forces had effectively isolated the far northern Gazan towns of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahiya from Gaza City, blocking movement except for those families heeding evacuation orders and leaving the three towns.

They said communications and internet services had been cut, disrupting rescue operations.

*   Summary

*   Gaza authorities say at least 72 killed across Gaza on Friday
*   Israeli forces isolate northern Gaza towns, residents say
*   Health officials in northern Gaza appeal for medical supplies
*   Israel says its fighters killed dozens of militants on Thursday

CAIRO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - At least 33 people were killed and 85 wounded in Israeli strikes that hit several houses on Friday in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, medics said, where residents said tanks blew up roads and houses.

The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said the death toll from the strikes could rise because some people were believed to be trapped under the rubble, and the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said children were among those killed. There was no immediate Israeli comment.

Other Israeli strikes killed at least 39 Palestinians across Gaza on Friday, 20 of them in Jabalia, the Gaza health ministry said.

Residents of Jabalia said Israeli tanks had reached the heart of the camp after pushing through suburbs and residential districts. They said the Israeli army was destroying dozens of houses daily, from the air and the ground, and by placing bombs in buildings then detonating them remotely.

The Israeli military said its forces, which have been operating in Jabalia for the past two weeks, killed dozens of militants in close-quarters combat on Thursday, carried out aerial strikes, and dismantled military infrastructure.

On Thursday Israel said it had killed the country's number one enemy, Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, whom it blamed for ordering [the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel by Hamas-led fighters, who killed 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive so far, according to Gaza's health authorities.

On Friday, health officials appealed for fuel, medical supplies and food to be sent immediately to three northern Gaza hospitals overwhelmed by the number of patients and injuries.

At the Kamal Adwan Hospital, medics said they had to replace children in intensive care with more critical cases of adults badly wounded by Israeli airstrikes on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in Jabalia on Thursday.

Israel said it had targeted militants holed up in the complex.

Kamal Adwan's director, Hussam Abu Safiya, said in a video sent to media that the children had been moved to another division inside the facility, where they were being cared for. "We're fighting Hamas, we're not fighting the people of Gaza," military spokesperson Nadav Shoshani told journalists in an online briefing.

Hamas and health officials say the aid has not been reaching the worst affected areas, including the three isolated towns.

Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said on X that the attack on the school was the third on an UNRWA facility this week, and that the agency had lost 231 team members in the past year of fighting.

Northern Gaza, which had been home to well over half the territory's 2.3 million people, was bombed to rubble in the first phase of Israel's assault a year ago.

Israel began its military campaign after the Oct."

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the specific details about the ambush, the number of vehicles destroyed, and casualties are not confirmed. More information is needed to verify these specific details.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, including airstrikes and sieges, starting on October 9, 2023, and continuing through May 2024. The BBC reported on heavy fighting in Jabalia, northern Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops are conducting a new ground operation, with the Israeli military stating they killed 20 "terrorists" there, while Hamas claimed its fighters targeted Israeli forces. The article mentions an Israeli evacuation order from October 6, 2024. The Guardian published an article on December 18, 2024, discussing the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza by Israeli forces, mentioning three offensives, with the third one starting on October 5, 2024, and ongoing.

The BBC article was published on October 8, 2024. The Guardian article includes satellite images and videos showing the destruction. The IDF stated that they target only military objectives. <image:34>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was heavy fighting in Jabalia, northern Gaza, involving Israeli tanks and troops, as well as Hamas fighters. The BBC reported on this on October 8, 2024.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces in Jabalia in October 2024. Specifically, the Wikipedia article mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company of 12 vehicles east of the Jabalia camp. This supports the claim that Hamas fighters successfully targeted Israeli vehicles. However, the claim's assertion that the image shows the aftermath of this specific ambush cannot be verified without further evidence.

From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/turkey-and-syria-accuse-israel-of-fostering-chaos-in-syria/): 
Content: "(TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY / AFP)

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s foreign minister and his Syrian counterpart on Wednesday warned Israel not to stir up chaos in Syria and demanded an end to all external interventions they accused of being aimed at destabilizing the war-torn country.

“Certain actors are bothered by the positive developments in Syria,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said after talks with Syria’s Asaad al-Shaibani in Ankara, referring to Israel and Kurdish YPG fighters operational in northeastern Syria.

“Israel is currently one of the biggest actors in this dark picture,” he said of its ongoing military incursions since the overthrow of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad late last year.

Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted Assad in a rebel offensive in December, the new interim government in Damascus has struggled to maintain stability and heal the wounds of the nearly 14-year civil war.

Meanwhile, Israel launched hundreds of strikes on military sites immediately following Assad’s overthrow, saying at the time it wanted to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of the new authorities it considers jihadists due to their past affiliation with al-Qaeda. (TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY / AFP)](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250813__69EU9ZQ__v1__HighRes__TurkeySyriaDiplomacy-640x400.jpg "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan (R) meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani in Ankara on August 13, 2025.

Standing next to him, Shaibani also warned against efforts to foster chaos in Syria.

“We’re facing new challenges that are no less dangerous than those we encountered during the years of war, foremost among them are repeated Israeli threats… through airstrikes,” he said.

Fidan alleged that efforts to destabilize Syria could be clearly seen in the March bloodshed in the coastal Alawite heartland of Latakia and in the recent deadly violence that gripped the southwestern Druze-majority province of Sweida, as well as in the Kurdish-dominated northeast.

Hundreds were killed in the Sweida clashes between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side and fighters from the Druze minority on the other. Israel vowed to protect the Druze and carried out airstrikes on government convoys in Sweida as well as the Defense Ministry headquarters in Damascus, after which the violence eventually subsided.

Jerusalem said at the time it intervened to block Syrian troops from entering southern Syria, to enforce its demands for the total demilitarization of Syria’s south, and to uphold a longstanding commitment to protect the Druze, thousands of whose coreligionists live in Israel.

“The events in Latakia and Sweida and the failure to integrate the YPG (into the Syrian state) are evidence of the challenges and obstacles facing the positive process underway,” Fidan said.

Shaibani said Israel’s actions “undermine the security of our citizens,” adding that “certain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts.”

“We are also confronting multiple foreign interventions, both direct and indirect… \[that\] push the country toward sectarian and regional strife,” he said without giving details but warning against “any reckless attempts to exploit events here.”

[! (Bakr ALkasem / AFP)

During the war, Assad’s government was backed by Russia, Iran and the latter’s Lebanon-based proxy terror group Hezbollah.

Fidan said the YPG — part of the US-backed Kurdish-led SDF but seen by Ankara as an extension of the PKK militant group — remained a concern over its refusal to integrate into the Syrian state despite a March agreement to do so.

The PKK, which fought a decades-long insurgency against Ankara, is currently in the throes of disbanding as part of a peace agreement with the Turkish government.

“We have not seen any developments that indicate the organization has eliminated the threat of armed action,” nor sent home the foreign fighters in its ranks, he said.

“In an environment where Turkey’s security demands remain unmet, we have no chance of remaining calm,” he warned.

“Not every actor in the region is as constructive as us,” Fidan claimed. “There are certain people who have been meddling in the affairs of Syria, chief among them the Israeli administration.”

 last week when he visited Damascus to meet with Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Syria last month requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities following the sectarian violence that increased tensions in the country and drew Israeli intervention.

Developments in Syria have increased tensions between Turkey and Israel, which has taken over the former no-man’s land adjacent to its border as a buffer zone.

In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

That month, Turkey and Israel [held talks](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-and-turkey-hold-syria-deconfliction-talks-to-avoid-military-clash/)
 on creating a deconfliction mechanism in Syria that would avoid clashes between the two countries."

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Syria’s interim government has requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat “terrorist organizations,” including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria’s defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

“As long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,” Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

“The heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey’s national security,” he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey’s national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be “following” the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria’s interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria’s national army."

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter."

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Debris is scattered at the site of an Israeli strike on a military airbase near Hama, Syria, April 3, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. Any activity that endangers Israel will threaten the rule of \[Syrian President Ahmed\] al-Sharaa.”

Turkish ministry sources also confirmed the talks in Azerbaijan, saying they mark the beginning of efforts to set up a channel to avoid potential clashes or misunderstandings between the two countries.

“Efforts will continue to establish this mechanism,” one of the sources said, without providing further details on the scope or timeline of the talks.

Turkey grapples over answer to Israel’s destabilising intervention in Syria as agendas collide
==============================================================================================

Erdogan’s display of anger shows to what extent Israel and Turkey find themselves today on opposite trajectories as their regional agendas have come to collide after after months of discrete efforts at de-confliction over their mutual goals in Syria.

DAMASCUS/ ANKARA

Following Israeli strikes on Damascus and other parts of Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered one of his harshest diatribes against Israel.

Speaking on television, Thursday, he accused Israel of “using the Druze as an excuse” to expand  “its banditry into neighbouring Syria.”

Then went on to say, “I want to state this once again, clearly and directly: Israel is a lawless, unruly, unprincipled, spoiled, pampered, and greedy terrorist state”.

“At this stage, the biggest problem in our region is Israel’s aggression… If the monster is not stopped immediately, it will not hesitate to throw first our region, then the world, into flames.”

The same day, he called Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to reassure him of Ankara’s support.

Erdogan’s display of anger shows to what extent Israel and Turkey find themselves today on opposite trajectories as their regional agendas have come to collide after after months of discrete efforts at de-confliction over their mutual goals in Syria.

Developments compelled Ankara to deploy intensive diplomatic efforts with an eye on bolstering the precarious position of Sharaa whose rule it has consistently backed, but it has only the diplomatic option to pursue towards this end.

Speaking to the media in New York, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said he was in close contact with Tom Barrack, US Special Envoy for Syria and the US ambassador to Turkey, and that he discussed the issue in phone calls with his Syrian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian counterparts.

Fidan revealed in this context that Ankara has conveyed its position regarding Israel’s air strikes on Syria to Israeli authorities via its intelligence agency.

Turkey has halted all trade and recalled its ambassador in Tel Aviv for consultations, but has not severed diplomatic nor intelligence links.

According to analysts, Turkey worries about Israel’s reliance on military power to challenge Turkish influence and destabilise the Sharaa regime.

Erdogan said Turkey will not allow Syria to be divided or its multicultural structure and territorial integrity harmed.

He seems to echo Sharaa’s who has accused Israel of seeking to “dismantle the unity of our people”, saying it had “consistently targeted our stability and created discord among us since the fall of the former regime”.

Ankara’s concerns go beyond Syria. And this, perhaps more than anything, must be answered,” Jonathan Adiri, an advisor to late Israeli president Shimon Peres, wrote in Ynetnews.

“The way forward is not meekness, but deterrence, crafted not through brute confrontation but through calibrated friction and strategic clarity,” he added.

Nobody expects a Turkish-Israeli confrontation over Syria, but continued Israeli escalation could further shake Sharaa’s hold on power and create opportunities for Iranian and Jihadist resurgence in Syria.

Reflecting his country’s mix of anger and wariness, the Turkish foreign minister called on the international community on Wednesday to contain the “dangerous situation”.

“Otherwise,” he warned, “it’s safe to say that undesirable consequences will emerge in the region.”

Also and despite their normalisation talks with Damascus, the Israelis never shed their suspicion of the new Syrian rulers’ jihadist past.

At the same time, they silently resented Ankara’s push for regional influence.

This sentiment seems harboured by many Israelis, and not only on the far-right.

“Turkey no longer sees itself as a neighbour. Israel will raise defence spending by 42 billion shekels ($12.5 billion) this year and in 2026, its finance and defence ministries said on Thursday, citing the country’s “security challenges”.

Its current annual defence represents about nine percent of the gross domestic product.

After Gaza, Lebanon and Iran, Israel has put to use its military power, instead of diplomacy, to achieve its goals in Syria.

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu  described the halt to hostilities in Sweida as “a ceasefire achieved through strength” and announced that Israel was imposing a new doctrine in Syria, which consists in demanding the demilitarisation of a swathe of territory near the border, stretching from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to the Druze Mountain, east of Sweida.

Israeli troops have also seized Syrian territory adjoining the occupied Golan Heights since December.

Israel’s military approach to the Sweida crisis seemed counter-intuitive to many experts as it ran against the logic of the US sponsored non-belligerence talks conducted by the Sharaa government with Israel in recent weeks, in Baku and elsewhere.

“Israel’s attacks on Damascus, following its military interventions in the south of Syria, constitute an act of sabotage against Syria’s efforts to secure peace, stability and security,” the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement.

But Itamar Rabinovich, an Israeli historian of Syria and former diplomat, has an explanation."

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

![Israeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border](/themes/custom/ccga/frontend/static-html/images/placeholder.png)

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:4496>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:4497>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to escalated fighting against Israel yesterday, following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by the Israeli military.

In a statement released yesterday morning, it announced "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy," which it said will be "elaborated upon" in the coming days.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Israel targets three hospitals in Gaza, says health ministry

The IDF is “besieging and directly targeting” three hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening to put them out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry said this morning.

It said the IDF was attacking the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital, and appealed to the international community to intervene "to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip."

According to the health ministry, hospital staff and at least 40 patients and wounded are trapped the Indonesian Hospital, as Israeli "artillery targeted the upper floors" of the hospital, as well as a group of displaced people in front of its gates.

The "heavy gunfire," towards the building and courtyards was "causing great panic among patients and medical staff," the health ministry said.

In a statement, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was "no intentional fire directed at it."

A drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the town of Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces said a drone crossing from Lebanon “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” while Israeli news outlet Ynet reported the sound of an explosion in the town.

The attack comes just days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF, but the latest strikes have provided a quick reality to check for any hopes his death could spell an end to the conflict.

At least 55 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel in the space of an hour on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the latest wave of missiles, including in the port city of Haifa which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks.

NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding non-stop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

Dramatic footage released by the Israeli military that purport to show Yahya Sinwar’s final moments will be etched in the Palestinian national memory for generations to come: the defiance of Sinwar, covered in dust and with his right arm blown off, yet still fighting.

It’s an image that brings to mind an uncomfortable comparison to Israel’s national hero Joseph Trumpeldor, the one-armed Zionist resistance fighter.

![Image:](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241019-sinwar-still-aa-f93d1a.jpg)

A video still of Sinwar in his final moments, released by the IDF. For them, this was a military commander fighting to the last, willing to sacrifice not only the lives of thousands of Israelis and tens of thousands of Palestinians — but also his own.

The scene of carnage in [northern Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/lebanon)
 showed heartbreaking snippets of everyday family life.

A dead baby inside a destroyed pickup truck; a child’s severed arm buried in nearby rubble; toddler clothing and books shredded; flies swarming as officials collected body parts, some too small for body bags ending up in clear ziplock bags.

Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials.

This was the aftermath of an airstrike Monday on the Lebanese Christian village of Aitou that Israel said had targeted a position held by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

Until then, this region of hilly olive groves and winding, sea-view roads had been a relative haven, one that felt far away from the war dominating Beirut and the country’s south.

Just last week, the area “was calm; everything was quiet,” Illy Edwan told NBC News as he surveyed the wreckage of his villa, which was reduced to rubble in the blast, its insulation and inner structure ripped to pieces, an adjacent vehicle twisted open like a burnt pretzel.

“My house used to be three-story, but look at it today,” he added.

Hundreds are dead and thousands more have been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as the IDF deepens its offensive in the area and sends more troops to fight.

The IDF laid siege to the camp 15 days ago, surrounding it with tanks while raining down artillery fire. Another person is in moderate condition after they were injured by shrapnel near the commercial center in Ein Hafaretz.

Air strikes have hit a suburb in Lebanon's capital Beirut this afternoon, less than an hour after the IDF ordered residents to evacuate the area.

Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said that a building in Haret Hreik was struck twice, and a plume of smoke was also seen rising from the area.

IDF spokesperson Avicahy Adraee had earlier given evacuation orders for the area.

Adraee issued multiple evacuation warnings today to residents in parts of southern Beirut, warning of future military operations in the area.

Spokesperson Avichay Adraee also ordered residents located in Choueifet Al-Umara and Borj El Brajneh to leave, saying they were "near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah," and urged people to evacuate.

Two patients have died inside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza due to Israel's siege on the area, according to the local health ministry.

It said the patients died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and lack of medical supplies."

In a statement earlier today, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was “no intentional fire directed at it.”

The war in Gaza "continues unabated," Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian relief said, days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, raising a fleeting hope it could bring an end to the war.

At least 20,000 people had been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as Israel deepens its offensive in the region, Lazzarini said, and there are shortages of the most basic needs, like food, water and blankets."

Israeli police sealed off the site of a reported drone attack in the northern town of Caesarea

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is undeterred from his war aims following a reported drone attack on his private residence.

"The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake," he wrote in a post on X.

His office earlier said a drone was "launched towards" his residence in the northern coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday morning.

Mr Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time, and no one was injured.

Iran says Hezbollah was behind the reported attack, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported.

Iran's mission to the UN was quoted as saying: "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon”.

Hezbollah - which is funded and equipped by Iran - has not commented on the reports.

The Israeli military said three drones were launched from Lebanon, with one hitting a building in Caesarea.

They did not confirm whether the building was part of the prime minister's residence, nor the extent of any damage.

US outlet Axios reported that the drone did hit the residence.

At 08:19 local time (06:19 BST), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: "In the last hour, three unmanned aerial vehicles crossed into the country from Lebanon.

"Two of the aircraft were intercepted.

The Israeli prime minister makes use of two private homes, in Caesarea and Jerusalem, and has also spent time at Beit Aghion, his official residence in Jerusalem, which is currently being renovated.

The reported attack comes as Israel prepares to respond to Iran's large-scale ballistic missile attack on 1 October - with Israel's defence minister saying its response would be "deadly, precise and surprising".

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

[In a post on X](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
, Netanyahu blamed “Iran’s proxy Hezbollah” for the attack he described as an assassination attempt, saying any actors who try to harm other citizens of Israel “will pay a heavy price.” 

“The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,” he said. It “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” the town where Netanyahu’s residence is located, about 50 miles from the northern border with Lebanon, the military said in a statement.

The IDF added that two other drones were intercepted and that the incident was under review.

Oct. Mahmoud Qamati, deputy head of Hezbollah’s political bureau, said in a phone call to Al Jazeera that Netanyahu should not feel secure.

In an earlier series of statements, Hezbollah said it had launched multiple missiles late Saturday in response to Israel’s attacks on Hezbollah locations in southern Lebanon, in defense of the Lebanese people, and “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.”

The statements did not say any targeted the prime minister’s residence.

The IDF said that as of 11 p.m., Hezbollah launched an estimated 200 missiles into Israel from Lebanon on Saturday. 

Forces from Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, have fired projectiles into northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas since shortly after its [Oct. “This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future.”

The Israel Defense Forces said the drone in question [crossed from Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/hundreds-evacuate-lebanon-as-more-hit-by-israeli-strikes-221953093678)

.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the attack, including in the port city of Haifa, which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks. NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding nonstop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

The drone strike comes just days after Israel [killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-israel-investigating-dead-rcna175892)
 during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of the Oct. 7 attacks and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF.

While some, including U.S. officials, have expressed hope that Sinwar’s death could pave a path toward a cease-fire and hostage deal, Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah have vowed to continue the war.

Netanyahu said Thursday that Sinwar’s death was the “beginning of the end” for Hamas, but that the war “is not yet over.”

Following the confirmation of Sinwar’s death, Hezbollah vowed to escalate fighting against Israel.

[AP Fact Check](https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check)

Mel Gibson did not post on social media about ‘the end’ of Israel
=================================================================

             ![FILE - Mel Gibson arrives at the 89th Academy Awards Nominees Luncheon in Beverly Hills, Calif. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor’s publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the “Braveheart” star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn’t quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The “post” features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

But Alan Nierob, Gibson’s publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor “did not make the post.” Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson “doesn’t have any public social media accounts.”

Ryder called her alleged encounter with Gibson "a painful and vivid memory"

**Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder have become embroiled in a row after she claimed he made anti-Semitic comments to her.**

The actress said he referred to her as an "oven dodger" in an apparent reference to her Jewish background.

Gibson's representative said Ryder's allegations, which she made in 2010 and repeated in a recent interview with The Sunday Times, were "100% untrue".

Ryder responded by asserting again that she and a late friend had been "on the receiving end of his hateful words".

The Stranger Things actress described the alleged encounter as "a painful and vivid memory".

*   [Can Mel Gibson make a comeback?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10611005)
    

Ryder first made the claims [in an interview with GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/winona-ryder-forever-black-swan-star-trek)
 in 2010. [She told this weekend's Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/winona-ryder-on-turning-50-missing-keanu-reeves-and-being-saved-by-normal-people-07rppmj3t)
: "We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we're all talking and he said to my friend, who's gay, 'Oh wait, am I gonna get Aids?'

"And then something came up about Jews, and he said, 'You're not an oven dodger, are you?'"

Ryder, 48, said Gibson, 64, had tried to apologise to her at a later date.

Ryder said Gibson made the remarks to her and her late friend, make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin

The Braveheart star's representative disputed Ryder's version of events, however, accusing her of "lying" about both the alleged comments and apology.

Gibson, he claimed, "did reach out to \[Ryder\], many years ago, to confront her about her lies and she refused to address it with him".

Ryder responded by offering more details, including that the encounter occurred "around 1996".

"I believe in redemption and forgiveness and hope that Mr Gibson has found a healthy way to deal with his demons, but I am not one of them," [she said in a statement](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/winona-ryder-response-mel-gibson-anti-semitic-homophobic-1234647217/)
.

"Only by accepting responsibility for our behaviour in this life can we make amends and truly respect each other, and I wish him well on this life-long journey."

Ryder, whose father is Jewish, was born Winona Laura Horowitz in 1971.

! In the Sunday Times she said she was "not religious" but identified as Jewish.

Chicken Run sequel
------------------

It is not the only time Gibson has been accused of using the offensive term, which alludes to the mass murder of Jews in Nazi death camps during World War Two.

In 2012 screenwriter Joe Eszterhas [accused the actor](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17692563)
 of using it while they were working on a film about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee.

Gibson, who [made widely documented anti-Semitic comments](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5234142.stm)
 when he was arrested for drink-driving in 2006, called Eszterhas's claims "utter fabrications".

The first memorials to the victims of the [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks")
 in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of [webmasters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/webmaster "wikt:webmaster")
 posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
 Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The first reading of the names of the victims of 9/11 took place at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2002.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Names-2)

The _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ was the first major physical memorial at the [World Trade Center site](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site "World Trade Center site")
. A permanent memorial and museum, the [National September 11 Memorial & Museum](/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum "National September 11 Memorial & Museum")
 at the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
, were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with 30-foot (9.1 m) waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials have been constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was [Pier A](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Pier_A_Park "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
 in [Hoboken, New Jersey](/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey "Hoboken, New Jersey")
. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called [Hoboken Island](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Hoboken_Island "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
, was chosen in September 2004.

_[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
_, the monumental and world's largest cast [bronze sculpture](/wiki/Bronze_sculpture "Bronze sculpture")
 of modern times created by German artist [Fritz Koenig](/wiki/Fritz_Koenig "Fritz Koenig")

 Plaza of the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
 in New York City from 1971 until the terrorist attacks on [September 11, 2001](/wiki/September_11,_2001 "September 11, 2001")
. The artefact, weighing more than 20 tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers after the attacks. Since then, the bronze sphere, primarily known in the United States as _The Sphere_, has been transformed into a symbolic memorial to commemorate [9/11](/wiki/9/11 "9/11")
. Having become a major [tourist attraction](/wiki/Tourist_attraction "Tourist attraction")
, the unrestored sculpture was rededicated on August 16, 2017, by the [Port Authority](/wiki/Port_Authority_of_New_York_%26_New_Jersey "Port Authority of New York & New Jersey")

The [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
 was a temporary memorial at Ground Zero.

Soon after the attacks, temporary memorials were set up in New York and elsewhere.

*   On October 4, Reverend Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest, blessed the [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
    , two broken beams at the crash site which had formed a cross, and then had been welded together by iron-workers.

     raised a special banner featuring the retired number of [Mark Bavis](/wiki/Mark_Bavis "Mark Bavis")
    , who was on United Airlines Flight 175. Bavis had played for the ECHL's [South Carolina Stingrays](/wiki/South_Carolina_Stingrays "South Carolina Stingrays")
    , and his retired number hangs in a special corner, independently from the Stingrays' retired numbers (#14, #24) and awards banners (1997 and 2001 Kelly Cup Championships), with the years he played for the team (1994–96), the date of his death (September 11, 2001), and an American flag.
*   Also on October 13, The [September 11 Photo Project](/wiki/September_11_Photo_Project "September 11 Photo Project")
     was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community-based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historic preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled "The September 11 Photo Project" in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
*   On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture _[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
    _, formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in [Battery Park City](/wiki/Battery_Park_City "Battery Park City")
    .[\[3\]](#cite_note-Sphere-3)
    

#### In other countries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In other countries")\
\]

In Europe, annually a commemoration of September 11 to never forget, [Nissoria](/wiki/Nissoria "Nissoria")
 was one of the first public places that dedicated a memorial to September 11 in Europe. Nissoria is in a small town located in the Province of Enna in Sicily, Italy. Two family members of this community, Vincenzo DiFazio and Salvatore Lopez, died on Sept 11 at the World Trade Center.

The then-mayor Dr. Marco Murgo along with the Chiara family Benito Sr. and son Mario developed the project to dedicate a small plot of land adjacent to a local school and museum that was entitled “Parco 11 Settembre”. The Commanding Officer of the nearby U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella met with this delegation from Nissoria and embraced this truly heartfelt initiative.

Ever since its dedication, and thanks to the present-day Mayor of Nissoria Dott. Armando Glorioso and Dott. Alberto Lunetta who continues this important event, a representation of both American and Italian military personnel from the nearby Military base NAS Sigonella comes to visit and annually commemorate along with all local Italian Authorities, Dignitaries and citizens who truly will never forget this tragic event.

*   According to [Radio Farda](/wiki/Radio_Farda "Radio Farda")
    's website, when the attacks' news was released, Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news on Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, the [United States Department of State](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State")
    , published a post on its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
     After the attacks, the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran condemned the attacks. [BBC](/wiki/BBC "BBC")
     and [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")
     published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens on their websites.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. It was in this climate that former President [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush")
 said in a speech at the Shanksville memorial that both foreign and domestic extremists were "children of the same foul spirit", a comparison which angered some right-wing politicians and media figures. President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")

Memorial at [Fort Bragg](/wiki/Fort_Bragg "Fort Bragg")
 in 2019, featuring over 7,000 boots, representing military service members killed since the September 11 attacks

The National 9/11 Flag was made from a tattered remains of a 30-foot (9.1 m) American flag found by recovery workers in the early morning of September 12, 2001. It was hanging precariously from some scaffolding at a construction site next to Ground Zero. Because of safety reasons the flag could not be taken down until late October 2001. Charlie Vitchers, a construction superintendent for the Ground Zero cleanup effort, had a crew recover the flag. It was placed in storage for seven years.[\[109\]](#cite_note-dnainfo.com-109)

The flag has made a number of appearances across the country, including a Boston Red Sox Game, a New York Giants Home Opener, and the USS _New York_ Commissioning Ceremony. It also appeared on the CBS Evening News and on ABC World News Tonight "Persons of the Week."[\[110\]](#cite_note-110)

The flag began a national tour on Flag day, which was on June 14, 2009. It visited all 50 states where service heroes, veterans, and other honorees each added stitching and material from other retired American flags in order to restore the original 13 stripes of the flag. The flag now resides at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)
[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)
[\[113\]](#cite_note-113)

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for "learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future." The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor's POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)"To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001." (2)"To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered." (2)"To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: "This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them" The Flag of Heroes reads: " This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan's Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks.[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)
 The flags were also featured on [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")
's _[Today](/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program) "Today (American TV program)")
_[\[115\]](#cite_note-115)
 and on [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")
 affiliate [WVEC](/wiki/WVEC "WVEC")
 in Norfolk, Virginia.[\[116\]](#cite_note-116)

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

Virtual memorials
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Virtual memorials")\
\]

The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as _[Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life")
_ has led to the construction of permanent virtual memorials and exhibits. Examples include:

*   Celestial Requiem NYC (Second Life)[\[117\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-117)
     is a virtual recreation of a submitted physical memorial proposal:

> On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")
    .

9/11 Memorial in Israel

[![9/11 memorial in Israel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.israelpharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9-11-memorial.jpg)
We wanted to share something with you, something that is not widely known to many Americans (and not all Israeli’s either).  
In Israel we have a dedicated memorial to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Not only does it stand out poignantly on a hill in the middle of Israel, near Jerusalem, but the base is made out of 9/11 twin tower wreckage. It cost more than $2 million to make and was orchestrated by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).  
Unfortunately Israel knows how to build memorials and monuments. In this small country with so much turbulence, we know only too well the suffering of those who die needlessly in these terrorist attacks. This memorial is known simply as the “9/11 Memorial Plaza”.  
Here are some interesting facts about the 9/11 Memorial Plaza.

*   The memorial Plaza was completed in 2009 for $2 million, by the JNF.
*   It sits on 5 acres of hillside, 20 miles from the center of Jerusalem, not a small monument at all. It overlooks Jerusalem’s largest cemetery, Har HaMenuchot.
*   The memorial monument is in the shape of a 30-foot, bronze American flag that has been built in the shape of a flame to commemorate the flames of the Twin Towers.
*   The base is made out of melted twin tower wreckage.
*   Surrounding the main monument are plaques listing the names of all the people who died as a result of the attacks. Even though the memorial stands in Israel and only 5 Israel citizens died as a result of the attacks the memorial lists ALL the victims who perished. It is the only memorial outside the US which lists ALL of those who died in the attacks.

Times are turbulent and the entire Middle East is going through vast changes. Some say the relationship between the US and Israel is in trouble…… whatever happens, there will always be a special relationship between the US (in particular New York) and Israel.  
A powerful memorial… so the world never forgets.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

    The Municipal Art Society of New York and Creative Time’s installation of 88 searchlights—conceived by John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian Laverdiere, and Paul Myoda with lighting consultant Paul Marantz—initially ran from March 11 through April 14, 2002, to mark the six-month anniversary of the attacks. “Obviously the deceased are not going to experience any of this but it needs to carry your memories of them.”

Following the tragic events on September 11, 2001, many cities, both in the US and abroad, built memorials for the victims, survivors, and first responders."

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

Two US aircraft carriers to stay in Middle East after Hezbollah attack

 The Georgia, a ballistic missile submarine, is still on its way to CENTCOM, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday.

Ryder didn’t say how long the Roosevelt would be extended or exactly when the decision was made, only saying Austin chose to do so over the weekend.

The surge seeks to provide some gray-hull deterrence after Israel launched two strikes in late July that heightened regional tensions — one in Lebanon’s capital that came in retaliation for an earlier strike from Hezbollah, and another in Tehran, killing the political leader of Hamas.

Since then, the U.S. The first came this weekend in an attack involving more than 230 rockets fired from Lebanon, [according to the Israeli military](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1828086019633406063)

The Pentagon has extended the deployment of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group after a largely failed attack by the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah on Israel over the weekend.

Choosing to keep the second carrier in the Middle East means there will now be two carriers and their warships available for U.S. Central Command amid the threat of a full regional war erupting.

The TR arrived in the Middle East in early July, while fellow carrier Abraham Lincoln steamed into the region last week.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced the decision [in a statement over the weekend.](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3883992/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)

Theodore Roosevelt replaced the carrier Dwight D. Preemptive strikes from Israel mainly thwarted the salvo, and both sides signaled that they were deescalating afterward.

When asked in a morning press conference with reporters Monday whether America’s surge in forces to the region had worked as intended, Ryder agreed.

“I think that the additional forces in the theater send a very clear message to all actors in the region that were serious when it comes to supporting the defense of Israel,” he said.

Ryder said the U.S. had helped Israel spot incoming rockets from Hezbollah but hadn’t participated in Israel’s preemptive strikes in Lebanon."

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

**Family “didn’t know”**
------------------------

As recordings of Asma Assad’s call with Sham circulated, local webpages and activists shared the recording of the father, who denied knowing Asma Assad’s phone call, saying: “I was not in the hospital at the time. , I don’t know about this call, I’ve heard of it just like you.”

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

**children, victims of the regime**

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

!Félix Maradiaga <image:4682>

Nicaraguan opponent Félix Maradiaga, during his speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum on June 13.

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities.

 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. In August 2016, [Norway](https://warontherocks.com/2016/06/norways-gender-neutral-draft/)
 implemented a universal conscription model — including, for the first time, a requirement for women. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)

, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)

 to include all Americans has generated [public rumors](https://thedispatch.com/article/mandatory-registration-for-the-draft-isnt-new-contrary-to-social-media-posts/)
 that the nation is on a wartime footing. These concerns are unfounded, but Americans’ confusion and anxiety over the use of the draft is understandable. Was the threat existential to America’s existence, requiring the level of conflict necessary to use a draft? For many, the answer to both questions was “no.” Any use of a draft in a future conflict will require addressing the errors of Vietnam.

For several reasons, the United States actively [decided](https://www.nixonfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/The-Report-Of-The-Presidents-Commission-On-An-All-Volunteer-Armed-Force.pdf)
 to move from a mixed force of conscripts (draftees) and professional service members to the all-volunteer force in 1973. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future."

### No Current Plans for Reactivation

In 2024, [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/10/trump-military-draft-mandatory-service/)
 that "a cluster of influential former administration officials and GOP lawmakers ... have mused aloud about a national service mandate and other measures to remedy what they see as a 'crisis' facing the all-volunteer military." However, Donald Trump responded that it was a "ridiculous idea."

The same year, in an analysis for [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/10/military-draft-conscription-soldiers-technology-nato-europe-russia-ukraine/)
, political scientist Raphael S. It would require formal legislation passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the president.

There's no existing authority -- even for a sitting president -- to bring back the draft unilaterally without that legal action. Any attempt to bypass Congress would be unconstitutional and almost certainly trigger massive legal, political and public pushback, including court challenges.

Until that happens, registering is a precaution, not a signal that anyone's about to get called up.

### Legal Framework for Reinstating the Draft

  
Any attempt to bring back the draft would typically be in response to the declaration of a national emergency or a large-scale war that would overburden the U.S. Cohen wrote: "After decades of becoming increasingly rare, the military draft is back in the debate."

Cohen noted that, despite the fact that modern warfare often emphasizes technology and drones, many countries are reintroducing or reconsidering the military draft, because large-scale conflicts still require a significant number of people. Despite occasional public anxiety during times of global tension or military escalation, there have been no formal moves by Congress or the executive branch to bring back the draft.

What Could Trigger a Return to the Draft?
-----------------------------------------

Although returning to the draft wouldn't happen lightly or without significant cause, possible scenarios that might trigger it include:

*   A large-scale ground war that requires a big increase in troop numbers
*   Multiple military conflicts going on around the world simultaneously, stretching U.S. Simply put, people who are medically unfit, already serving, conscientious objectors (with approval) or otherwise legally exempt cannot be drafted.

If a draft were to return, those selected would undergo a classification process to determine their eligibility and to see whether there are any deferments or exemptions. The process would look something like this:

*   **Physical and Mental Assessments:** Registrants would be evaluated at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) to check their physical and mental fitness for military service.
*   **Eligibility Verification:** Factors such as age, health and legal status would be reviewed to confirm eligibility.
*   **Deferments and Exemptions:** Depending on the person, some may qualify for deferments (temporary postponements) or exemptions (permanent exclusions) from service.

Again, classification would only occur if Congress and the president decide to resume a draft. At that time, those qualified for induction would have the opportunity to file claims for exemptions, deferments and postponements from military service.

### Appeals and Conscientious Objection

  
Those who believe they should not be inducted due to personal beliefs or circumstances have avenues to appeal:

*   **Local Draft Boards:** Registrants could present their case to a local board, which will decide whether to grant or deny their claim.
*   **Appeal Process:** If the local board denies the claim, the individual could appeal to a district appeal board. If the district board were to deny the claim, and the vote wasn't unanimous, further appeal to the national appeal board would be possible.

Those whose objections are based on moral or religious grounds -- aka conscientious objectors -- could (if approved) be assigned to noncombatant roles within the military or, in some cases, to civilian service contributing to the national health, safety or interest.

For more information on conscientious objection, visit the [Conscientious Objectors](https://www.sss.gov/conscientious-objectors/)
 page on the Selective Service System's website.

You may be wondering, "What happens if you get drafted and refuse to go?" Refusing to comply with a draft order can lead to legal penalties, including fines and possible jail time.

Why Are People Worried the Draft Might Come Back?

In recent years, a whole host of global events, political tensions and information spread online have stirred public concerns that the U.S."

The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question: Vote on a Draft Resolution\*
=================================================================================

This afternoon (4 June) at 4 pm EST, the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
 that was initiated by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). The draft text in blue demands an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire in Gaza; the immediate, dignified, and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups; and the immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory.

Conditions in Gaza have continued to deteriorate amid Israel’s escalating military operation following the expiry of its ceasefire agreement with Hamas in March and the country’s decision to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory. Alleging aid diversion by Hamas, Israel and the US have advanced a plan coordinated by a new private entity called the [Gaza Humanitarian Foundation](https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/wcm_upload_files/2025/05/08/BJbxp4cgel/Gaza_Humanitarian_Foundation_Overview__1_.pdf)
 (GHF) that would bypass the existing delivery architecture run by the UN and its humanitarian partners. While there was apparently some debate about the appropriate language to use in reference to certain elements—including Hamas and the release of hostages—it seems that the elected members agreed on the key provisions of a draft resolution. It seems that the US expressed reservations about the draft and made several proposals that it considered prerequisites for further engagement, including a condemnation of Hamas and expression of support for the GHF. Other P5 members apparently signalled overall support for the resolution but suggested certain revisions: France and the UK also sought language condemning Hamas, while Russia proposed several edits, including the deletion of references to the IPC report and to [resolution 2735](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4051310?ln=en&v=pdf)
 of 10 June 2024—on which Russia abstained—that welcomed the 31 May 2024 ceasefire proposal announced by the US.

As several of the proposed changes were unacceptable to other members, the E10 apparently viewed their initial draft as the most balanced reflection of positions. Despite the possibility of a US veto, however, it seems that the E10 chose to move forward with the vote as a political signal to emphasise the need for Council action as the ceasefire negotiations have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough and the humanitarian toll of the conflict continues to rise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

_\*\*Post-script:_ On 4 June, the Security Council voted on the draft resolution submitted by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). On 19 May, Israel [announced](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/904878/)
 that it would restore limited access to allow a “minimum” amount of humanitarian aid to enter the territory until a new aid delivery mechanism that Israel and the US have developed was operational.

Most Council members remain concerned about that mechanism. The GHF has begun delivering aid at designated distribution sites secured by US contractors and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)."

During the past year of negotiations, Israel has insisted it must control the movement of Palestinians to the north to ensure Hamas does not take weapons back into those areas.

Throughout the war, the Israeli military has severed the north from the rest of Gaza by holding the so-called Netzarim Corridor, a belt across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. Negotiations over it are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire.

Phase two’s broad outlines are laid out in the draft: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a “sustainable calm.”

But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues.

Israel has said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated and it cannot rearm — ensuring Hamas no longer runs Gaza. Here are the terms — and tensions "Twitter")

Without a deal within those 42 days to begin the second phase, Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas – even as dozens of hostages remain in the militants’ hands.

Hamas has agreed to a draft of the ceasefire deal, two officials confirmed, but Israeli officials say details are still being worked out, meaning some terms could change, or the whole deal could even fall through. By the end of the phase, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed.

, a mix of civilians and soldiers, and the military believes at least a third them are dead.

On the first official day of the ceasefire, Hamas is to free three hostages, then another four on the seventh day. Protesters said they see little hope in a “hypocritical” U.S.–backed peace plan.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there were discussions about the possibility of a draft in the U.S. in August 2024, but there were no plans to reactivate it. The evidence also mentions a draft resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war in June 2025.

The claim that the U.S. reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war is not supported by the evidence. While there were discussions and rumors, there is no evidence of the draft being reinstituted.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were discussions about the possibility of a draft in the U.S. in August 2024, but there were no plans to reactivate it. The evidence also mentions a draft resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war in June 2025.

The claim that the U.S. reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war is not supported by the evidence. While there were discussions and rumors, there is no evidence of the draft being reinstituted.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The War on the Rocks published an article on August 8, 2024, discussing the possibility of a draft in the U.S., mentioning that conscription is being discussed among U.S. allies and adversaries. It also mentions recent proposals to automate Selective Service System registration and expand it to include all Americans, which has led to public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing. (<image:k>) Military.com states that there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024. Any attempt to bring back the draft would require legislation passed by Congress and signed by the president.
