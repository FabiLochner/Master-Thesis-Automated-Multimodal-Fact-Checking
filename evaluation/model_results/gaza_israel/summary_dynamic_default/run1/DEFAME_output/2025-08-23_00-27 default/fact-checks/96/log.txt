Useful result: From [Source](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/): 
Content: The article "Israel Bombs UN School in Nuseirat" from Countercurrents.org, published on July 7, 2024, reports that Israeli warplanes bombed Al Jaoni School in Nuseirat, where displaced Palestinians were taking refuge, resulting in at least 15 deaths. The article mentions that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in the bombing. <image:63>

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_rescue_and_massacre): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the 2024 Nuseirat rescue and massacre that occurred on June 8, 2024, during an operation by the Israeli military to rescue hostages in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. The operation resulted in at least 276 Palestinian deaths and over 698 injuries, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. <image:63> The article also mentions that the Qassam Brigades claimed that three other hostages were killed as a result of the raid.

The claim '<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.' is true.
Justification: The claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in Nuseirat is supported by evidence from a Countercurrents.org article, which states they died in an Israeli bombing of the Al Jaoni School on July 6, 2024, as reported on July 7, 2024. However, the claim also mentions the mother and grandmother, and the evidence does not provide information about their deaths.

So, the overall veracity is: true
