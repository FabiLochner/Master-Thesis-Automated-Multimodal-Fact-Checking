## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Harvard University discuss the use of genetic tests in Israel to determine if potential immigrants are Jewish, as mentioned in articles published by Oxford University Press (<image:k>) and written by Ian V. McGonigle and Lauren W. Herman. A bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information was passed by the Israeli parliament's science committee, as reported by Haim Watzman and published by Springer Nature (<image:k>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
DNA tests can be used in Israel for legal processes, including immigration cases and confirming Jewish ancestry, but require permission from an Israeli court. Tests from platforms like 23andMe or Ancestry are not recognized by secular Israeli authorities. Legally valid DNA tests must be conducted in licensed Israeli laboratories, following a court order and prescribed legal procedure; tests performed privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts. <image:k>, ![image 4114](media/2025-08-23_00-47-1755910043-455253.jpg), ![image 4115](media/2025-08-23_00-47-1755910043-747747.jpg), ![image 4116](media/2025-08-23_00-47-1755910044-034833.jpg), ![image 4117](media/2025-08-23_00-47-1755910044-359991.jpg), ![image 4118](media/2025-08-23_00-47-1755910044-632625.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is not entirely accurate. While there are restrictions on DNA testing in Israel, it is not illegal to do a DNA test. DNA tests can be used in legal processes, but they require permission from an Israeli court and must be conducted in licensed Israeli laboratories. Tests from platforms like 23andMe or Ancestry are not recognized by secular Israeli authorities.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, but it is regulated. Tests are permitted under specific conditions, such as court orders and licensed laboratories. Therefore, the claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel is false.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
DNA tests are not illegal in Israel, but they are regulated. Legal DNA tests require permission from an Israeli court and must be conducted in licensed Israeli laboratories, as stated by sources like [blaerlaw.com](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/) and [pravoisrael.us](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/). Tests from platforms like 23andMe or Ancestry are not recognized by secular Israeli authorities.
