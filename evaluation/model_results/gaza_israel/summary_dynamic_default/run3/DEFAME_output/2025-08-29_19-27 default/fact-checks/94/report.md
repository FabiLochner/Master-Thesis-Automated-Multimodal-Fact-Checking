The image in the claim is found in multiple sources. One source is a VOA News article from January 24, 2018, titled "Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks" ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)).

Another source is a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east](https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east)) discussing emerging trends in chemical weapons usage in the Middle East. The report also includes the image of the girl with the oxygen mask. ![image 5763](media/2025-08-23_01-50-1755913852-735646.jpg) An ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)) also features the image, but the context is related to chemical attacks in Syria. ![image 61](media/94.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article from April 26, 2024, discusses a baby girl in Gaza who died after her mother was killed in an Israeli airstrike. The BBC article discusses a video released by Hamas, which appears to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip, wearing an oxygen mask. The Middle East Eye article from April 24, 2025, discusses the impact of the war on Gaza, including the decrease in life expectancy and the impact on health facilities. The article includes an image of a medic helping a woman with an oxygen mask ![image 61](media/94.jpg).

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is from 2018 and depicts a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. The image is associated with a reported gas attack in the eastern Ghouta region of Syria.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from 2018 and shows a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. The image is associated with a reported gas attack in Syria. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`
