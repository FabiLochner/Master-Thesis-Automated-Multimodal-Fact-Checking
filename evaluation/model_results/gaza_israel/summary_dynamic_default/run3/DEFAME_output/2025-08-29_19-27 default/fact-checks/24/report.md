## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that UNRWA placed a black band on its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar is false. The black ribbon was added to the logo to show solidarity with the victims of war and to pay tribute to UNRWA team members killed in Gaza. The logo was updated on October 18, 2023. UNRWA refuted claims that an agency staff member was killed alongside Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

## Final Judgement
The claim is false. The black ribbon on the UNRWA logo was not to mourn Yahya Sinwar, but to show solidarity with victims of war and to pay tribute to UNRWA team members killed in Gaza.

`false`
