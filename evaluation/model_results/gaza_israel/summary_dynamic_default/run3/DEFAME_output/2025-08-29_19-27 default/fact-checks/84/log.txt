Useful result: From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7): Found exact image on website with title: MISSING CONTEXT: This image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ...
Content: The image in the claim dates back to 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and was featured in a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. <image:53>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/): Found exact image on website with title: Prime Minister's Residence - The Times of Israel
Content: The Times of Israel published an article titled "Drones, moans and groans: Hezbollah attacks PMâ€™s home; petty politics continue unintercepted" on October 21, 2024. The article discusses a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in Caesarea. <image:53> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as confirmed by a CNN article ([CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/)). However, the image was taken before August 2024, as evidenced by a reverse image search that found the image in a 2019 YouTube video and a 2020 _Times of Israel_ article. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date the image was taken.

So, the overall veracity is: false
