## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Bangkok Post published an article on February 23, 2025, stating that police in Pai district, Mae Hong Son province, Thailand, found no Israeli influence, settlements, or business dominance. The article mentions that 4,573 Israelis visited Pai as of the time of the article. ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) The Nation published an article on February 18, 2025, refuting social media claims about an Israeli "promised land" in Pai district, Thailand.

Khaosod English published an article on February 23, 2025, discussing fears among some Thais that Israelis are turning Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, into an occupied land. The article mentions that the Prime Minister of Thailand assured the public that these fears are unsubstantiated.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3299193/young-israelis-rile-thailands-pai-town-their-bad-behaviour): 
Content: The South China Morning Post published an article about young Israelis in Pai, Thailand. ![image 5820](media/2025-08-29_19-28-1756495732-351821.jpg)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.88, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.02, 'Argentina': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. Several news articles from February 2025 address concerns about Israelis in Pai District, Thailand. These articles refute claims of Israeli settlements or business dominance, with the Thai Prime Minister assuring the public that fears of occupation are unsubstantiated. The image search reveals an article about young Israelis in Pai, Thailand. The geolocation analysis indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is likely false. While the image might depict Israelis, the context provided in the claim, specifically the assertion of them being settlers in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, is contradicted by news reports from the same period. These reports deny the existence of Israeli settlements or business dominance in the area and the geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in Israel.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. News articles from February 2025 ([Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai), [The Nation](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434), [Khaosod English](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) refute the idea of Israeli settlements or business dominance in Pai District, Thailand, and the geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in Israel.
