## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 8](media/8.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. One source, "[Islamic State] (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map" ([https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)), uses the image in reports about the ongoing conflict in Syria, including events from July 18, 2025, and includes a map of the conflict. Another source, "News Live - Oregon" ([https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)), also uses the image and contains news about events in Oregon, including police investigations, fires, and shootings, and has a section for news from October 26, 2024. The image is also found in an article from Harapan Daily ([https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)) discussing the conflict between Israel and Gaza, mentioning the role of Iran.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli strikes on Iran on October 26, 2024, in retaliation for earlier attacks. The strikes, codenamed Operation Days of Repentance, targeted military sites, including missile and drone manufacturing sites, and air-defense batteries. The strikes resulted in the destruction of a nuclear weapons research facility and S-300 missile systems.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)) both include images of the aftermath of the strikes ![image 888](media/2025-07-20_10-01-1753005670-702513.jpg), ![image 8](media/8.jpg). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran)) also discusses the strikes.


## Elaboration
The claim is supported by the evidence. The reverse image search confirms that the image is associated with events in the Middle East. The web search confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, and that the image is associated with the aftermath of these strikes.


## Final Judgement
The image is associated with the Israeli strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The reverse image search and web search confirm the event and the image's association with it.

`true`
