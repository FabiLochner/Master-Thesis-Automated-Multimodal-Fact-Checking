Useful result: From [Source](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza): 
Content: The search result from The National Desk discusses a doctored image of a poll, which was shared by Rep. Erakat, seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12. The original image was a 2022 Channel 12 poll. The doctored image asked if a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian. The article was published on August 9, 2024. <image:6699>

Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/): 
Content: The article from Mondoweiss, published on August 19, 2024, discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll, conducted by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies, surveyed attitudes regarding the "Swords of Iron" operation. The article also mentions a Channel 12 report.

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll that was not broadcast by Channel 12. The original footage, published on May 27, 2022, featured a different question than the one presented in the image, which falsely claimed to ask about a soldier's permission to rape a prisoner. The original question was: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

So, the overall veracity is: false
