## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 31](media/56.jpg)) appears in multiple articles discussing explosions in Lebanon in September 2024. One article from DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061)) fact-checks the claim, stating the image is unrelated to the attacks.

Other sources, such as ITC.ua ([https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/](https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/)) and The China Academy ([https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/](https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/)), also feature the image (![image 31](media/56.jpg)) and discuss the attacks, with the ITC.ua article including another image (![image 343](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846049-318073.jpg)). These articles report that the attacks targeted electronic devices, including iPhones, and resulted in casualties.


### Evidence from `web_search`

The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vp7dg3ml1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vp7dg3ml1o)) discusses the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and includes maps of the conflict areas (![image 6448](media/2025-08-29_19-53-1756497231-994856.jpg), ![image 6454](media/2025-08-29_19-53-1756497235-736736.jpg), ![image 6456](media/2025-08-29_19-53-1756497236-351184.jpg), ![image 6458](media/2025-08-29_19-53-1756497236-841004.jpg), ![image 6460](media/2025-08-29_19-53-1756497237-080685.jpg)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Community discusses an iPhone that exploded ([https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252212685](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252212685)). The Free Press Journal published an article about an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket ([https://www.freepressjournal.in/tech/iphone-users-beware-apple-iphone-13-mobile-explodes-inside-youths-pocket-in-ups-aligarh-causes-serious-burn-injuries-video](https://www.freepressjournal.in/tech/iphone-users-beware-apple-iphone-13-mobile-explodes-inside-youths-pocket-in-ups-aligarh-causes-serious-burn-injuries-video)).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 ([https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/11/14/apple-investigating-iphone-x-that-exploded-after-updating-to-ios-121](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/11/14/apple-investigating-iphone-x-that-exploded-after-updating-to-ios-121)). The provided sources show images of exploded iPhones (![image 6461](media/2025-08-29_19-54-1756497249-436927.jpg), ![image 6462](media/2025-08-29_19-54-1756497249-887610.jpg), ![image 6463](media/2025-08-29_19-54-1756497250-979585.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported. The image (![image 31](media/56.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been used in articles discussing the September 2024 attacks in Lebanon, but a fact-check from DW.com states that the image is unrelated to the attacks. Other sources confirm the attacks targeted electronic devices, including iPhones, and resulted in casualties.

The claim is partially false because the image is not directly related to the attacks, even though the attacks did involve exploding devices. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially false. While the image (![image 31](media/56.jpg)
