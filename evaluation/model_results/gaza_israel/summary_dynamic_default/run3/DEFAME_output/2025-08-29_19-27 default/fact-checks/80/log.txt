Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas, and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir. <image:6675>, <image:6676>, <image:6678>. The article mentions the handover of the bodies by Hamas and the grief of Israelis.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article on September 5, 2024, about a protest in Tel Aviv. The protesters carried 27 mock coffins to represent hostages killed in Gaza. <image:49> is included in the article.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jta.org/2025/08/29/united-states/boulder-israeli-hostage-march-that-was-firebombed-is-now-relocating-amid-ongoing-harassment): 
Content: The search result from JTA, published on August 29, 2025, discusses the relocation of the Boulder, Colorado chapter of Run For Their Lives, an Israeli hostage awareness event, due to ongoing harassment. The article mentions a firebomb attack on June 1, 2025, and subsequent targeting by anti-Israel counter-demonstrators.

The claim '<image:49> This image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, representing hostages killed in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The image is from a protest and not from a reburial ceremony, as confirmed by [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/israeli-men-carry-a-coffin-draped-in-israeli-flag-during-a-news-photo/1250797534) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/protesters-carry-mock-coffins-in-tel-aviv-to-represent-hostages-killed-in-gaza/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
