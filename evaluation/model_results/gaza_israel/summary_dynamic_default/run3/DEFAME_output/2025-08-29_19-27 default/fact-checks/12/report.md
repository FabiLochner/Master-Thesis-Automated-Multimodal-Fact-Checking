## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's presence unlawful and obligating it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence. The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion on December 19, 2024. The UN General Assembly requested the ICJ to render an advisory opinion in December 2022.

The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The article mentions the UN General Assembly's resolution that gave effect to the ICJ's opinion. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations. The article also discusses the dire humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. ![image 756](media/2025-07-18_21-40-1752874842-948189.jpg)

## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024 regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and obligated it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article discussing the ICJ's advisory opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The article also mentions the UN General Assembly's resolution that gave effect to the ICJ's opinion.

The evidence supports the claim that the ICJ found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful. However, the claim states that Israel has been declared an illegal state, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence. The ICJ's opinion focuses on the illegality of Israel's presence and policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, not on the illegality of the state itself.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the ICJ issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful. However, the claim states that Israel was declared an illegal state, which is not directly supported by the evidence. The ICJ's opinion focuses on the illegality of Israel's presence and policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, not on the illegality of the state itself.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful and obligating it to end its presence and cease settlement activities, as detailed in the [ICJ summary](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176) and discussed in a [Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect article](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/). However, the ICJ's ruling focused on the illegality of Israel's presence and policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, not on declaring Israel an illegal state.
