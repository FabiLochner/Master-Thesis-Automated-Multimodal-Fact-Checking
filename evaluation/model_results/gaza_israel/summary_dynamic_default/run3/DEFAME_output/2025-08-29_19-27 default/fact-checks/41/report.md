The ACLU ([https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil)) also reported the arrest in March 2025, with Khalil's legal team claiming the arrest was retaliatory.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on June 20, 2025, about Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, facing deportation from the U.S. after being arrested by immigration agents. The arrest was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators. Khalil was arrested in 2024 and was held for three months before a judge ruled he must be released.
