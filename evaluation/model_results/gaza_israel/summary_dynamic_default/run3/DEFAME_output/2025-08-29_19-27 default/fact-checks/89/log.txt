The claim 'For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for his assassination on July 31, 2024, is not confirmed. While reports indicate Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran and suggest the use of cell phone tracking or intercepted communications by Israeli intelligence, there is no direct evidence to verify that WhatsApp was specifically used for tracking, as indicated by sources like the [bne Gulf bureau](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/) and [Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
