### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) fact-checked the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating that the White House offered no evidence for the story. USAID spent no money on condoms in the entire Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years. <image:k> The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)) reported that there is no evidence to support the claim.

A review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Both CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)) found no evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East during the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Elon Musk, who was associated with the claim, retracted it. A review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148)).

Multiple sources, including CNN and the Associated Press, found no evidence to support the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim, and USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza.
