## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.

However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the rubble.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Elaboration
The web search results provide additional images of Palestinian children in Gaza, some amidst rubble, and the Getty Images search result includes images dated from October 2023 to June 2025. However, none of the provided evidence contains the image in the claim or confirms the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because the provided evidence does not contain the image or confirm the specific details of the claim. The image search and web search results provide context about children in Gaza and Israeli airstrikes, but they do not confirm the image's origin, date, or the cause of the rubble. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

While the image search and web search results provide context about children in Gaza and Israeli airstrikes, they do not confirm the image's origin, date, or the cause of the rubble. The evidence includes images of children in rubble in Gaza ([https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/children-gaza](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/children-gaza)), but none of the provided sources contain the image in the claim.
