JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

### Analysis

The IDF stated that they had performed an assessment and concluded that Hezbollah was responsible for the rocket attack.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)
 IDF spokesman [Daniel Hagari](/wiki/Daniel_Hagari "Daniel Hagari")
 stated that the type of rocket used was an Iranian-made Falaq-1,[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)
 carrying a 50 kg [warhead](/wiki/Warhead "Warhead")
, which has previously been used by Hezbollah, the only Iranian proxy to possess it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-ynet28july-36)
 The Israeli army posted pictures of Falaq-1 shrapnel that it said was found at the scene of the attack, but with no apparent pictures of the shrapnel in situ at the blast site.[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)

A Hezbollah spokesperson, [Mohammad Afif](/wiki/Mohammad_Afif "Mohammad Afif")

 projectile launched in the course of countering Hezbollah rocket fire aiming for Israeli military sites.[\[25\]](#cite_note-TheGuardian20240728-26)
 Iranian and Qatari state media claimed there were reports that an Iron Dome interceptor was to blame.[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)
[\[40\]](#cite_note-41)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-42)
 Additionally, _[Al-Mayadeen](/wiki/Al-Mayadeen "Al-Mayadeen")
_, a Lebanese outlet with close ties to Hezbollah, stated that the blast site was inconsistent with a Falaq-1, which it said would have left a larger impact crater;[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)
 subsequent to the report, the Israeli government voted to ban _Al-Mayadeen_ from operating inside Israel.[\[42\]](#cite_note-43)

According to US intelligence, there were no doubts that Hezbollah was responsible but it was not certain if Hezbollah intentionally targeted the site or misfired.[\[29\]](#cite_note-APNews20240728-30)

Israeli authorities have characterized it as the deadliest attack on their civilians since the 7 October attacks.[\[27\]](#cite_note-CNN20240727-28)

The _Associated Press_ reported that rocket sirens sounded less than a minute before the explosion, which left a crater 2 meters wide. He stated that while the conflict would come at a significant cost, the goal is to decisively defeat Hezbollah and restore peace, and he has directed the Foreign Ministry to prepare a global campaign to support actions in Lebanon.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 27 Sep 202427 Sep 2024

Hezbollah has [confirmed](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
 that its leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/liveblog/2024/9/28/israel-attacks-lebanon-deaths-mount-as-beirut-buildings-bombed-to)
, has been killed in an Israeli air attack on the group’s headquarters in Lebanon’s capital Beirut.

Israeli media reported earlier on Saturday that Nasrallah was at the headquarters that was attacked and that Israel had used “bunker-busting” bombs.

The news comes after a night of Israeli bombardment around Lebanon.

Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and additional Hezbollah commanders were also killed in the huge air attack on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military claimed.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said a total of six people were killed and 91 injured in the bombardment, which levelled six apartment buildings. Israeli air attacks continued to hammer Beirut’s southern suburbs and other areas of Lebanon into Saturday.

Where is Israel striking in Lebanon?
------------------------------------

The Israeli army says it has struck more than 140 Hezbollah targets since Friday evening, including the “central headquarters of Hezbollah” that, it says, was “embedded underneath residential buildings in the area of Beirut”.

On Saturday, Israel’s military said jet fighters had also attacked “dozens” of Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and various areas of southern Lebanon and the attacks are continuing.

Israeli forces said they had targeted buildings where weapons were believed to be stored as well as sites from where rockets were launched into Israel.

Israel launched an assault on the southern suburbs of Beirut in a series of attacks on Friday in the heaviest bombardment since it escalated its offensive against Lebanon earlier this month. “I have covered a lot of aftermaths of Israeli air strikes in these southern suburbs of Beirut but nothing like this.”

The latest wave of attacks on Beirut is reminiscent of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, one resident in Lebanon’s capital told Al Jazeera.

But just like then, these attacks will not do anything to stamp out Hezbollah, the resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

“At the end of the day they \[are\] just bombing, and killing people, and displacing people,” he said.

“\[Israel’s attacks\] won’t stop anything in the south … The rockets are there, the men are there.”

How many people have been hurt?
-------------------------------

As well as those killed in the assault in which Israeli forces killed Nasrallah, reports on Friday indicated at least 76 had been wounded.

On Saturday, Lebanon Civil Defense said one of its staff had been killed while providing emergency services in southern Beirut in the aftermath of the intense Israeli attacks on Friday evening.

One other staff member is in critical condition, Lebanon’s Civil Defense added.

The country’s state-run National News Agency reported that 11 doctors, nurses and paramedics had been killed and 10 others wounded in Israeli army attacks on civil defence centres and a medical clinic.

These attacks were carried out on the towns of Taybeh and Deir Siriane, close to the Israeli border.

Israel’s attacks on Lebanon have killed more than 700 people since Monday.

In a separate statement, Lebanon’s Health Ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop admitting nonemergency cases until the end of next week to make room for patients from Beirut’s southern suburbs.

What about the people in the residential buildings?
---------------------------------------------------

Dahiyeh is a densely populated area, home to more than half a million civilians, many of whom had been scrambling to evacuate to safety as Israel started attacking the area last week. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged Israel will continue its attacks.

Speaking at the United Nations in New York City on Friday, just hours before the attacks, he said, “As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely.”

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who is also in New York at the UN General Assembly, said in a statement that “the new aggression proves that the Israeli enemy does not care about all international efforts and calls for a ceasefire.”

aj-logo “Currently, everything is being hit.”

One resident who lives in the neighbouring Palestinian refugee camp, Bourj el Barajneh, told Al Jazeera the attack shook the entire area and camp residents are now fleeing to other areas.

Was there any warning?
----------------------

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said in a news briefing that Israel did not inform the United States in advance of the attack, but that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke by phone with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin while the attack was in progress.

The attacks came as reports had emerged in recent days that negotiations for a ceasefire may be under way. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said the attacks destroyed at least seven buildings in the Haret Hreik suburb of the neighbourhood, turning them into a pile of rubble. While Hezbollah has its headquarters in the area, Dahiyeh “is a suburb, just like any other suburb in the world”, said Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem.

“Many families were starting to think about leaving, weighing their options, but where?” he said, noting that locations across Lebanon have been hit by attacks in recent days. Attacks on Beirut and areas around Lebanon continued through the night into Saturday.

More than a dozen explosions were reported in the neighbourhood of Dahiyeh, which had already been hit by air raids in recent days. Civil defence teams are working on putting out multiple fires in the area and have asked people to donate blood due to the likelihood of a high number of casualties.

The explosions were heard as far away as Jounieh, a 25-minute drive north of Beirut. “This attack was massive,” said Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr."

Israel Preempts Hezbollah Attack
================================

\- Tuesday, August 27, 2024 by [Ari Cicurel](https://jinsa.org/person/ari-cicurel/)
 and |

Share:

_On August 25, Israel disrupted a planned, massive Hezbollah attack by preemptively striking and neutralizing roughly two-thirds of the projectiles that the terrorist group planned to launch from southern Lebanon. Hezbollah nevertheless managed to fire at least 230 rockets and 20 drones in retaliation for the Israeli strike that killed its most senior military commander, Fuad Shukr, on July 30._

_Israel’s preemptive strike combined with its successful air defenses marked substantial victories that strengthened its deterrence and signaled its ability to thwart a large attack from Hezbollah. That Hezbollah delayed its retaliatory strike for almost four weeks, that it limited its attack relative to the 4,000 rockets it is capable of launching daily, and that Iran chose to stay out of the fighting entirely all demonstrate the deterrent impact of close U.S.-Israeli coordination and the deployment of strong military forces to the Middle East. 
_

[Click here to read the NatSec Brief.](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Israel-Preempts-Hezbollah-Attack-NatSec-Brief-4.pdf) To deter further escalation, the United States should maintain its strong deployment of naval and air assets in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean regions and closely coordinate with Israel to help defend against further Hezbollah or Iran-linked attacks. These factors also indicate that neither Hezbollah nor Iran want to escalate to a full-scale war at this moment."

CNN  — 

As tit-for-tat strikes strain [a ceasefire](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-explainer-intl-latam/index.html)
 between Israel and Hezbollah less than a week since it went into effect, Israel’s defense minister on Tuesday threatened to directly target the Lebanese state should the agreement fall apart.

Monday was the deadliest day since that agreement came into force last Wednesday, with Israeli strikes killing nine in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah fired at Israeli-occupied territory, citing Israeli truce violations.

“If we return to war, we will act with strength, go deeper,” Israel Katz said during a visit on Tuesday to the 146th Division of the Israel Defense Forces, near the Lebanese border.

Were the ceasefire to collapse, he said, “there will no longer be any exemptions for the State of Lebanon. The attacks were retaliation for Hezbollah firing two rockets at Israeli-occupied territory – themselves a response to near-daily Israeli attacks on Lebanon beginning the day after a truce began last Wednesday.

The exchange of fire casts doubt on the longevity of the ceasefire brokered by the United States – though State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted on Monday that “we have not seen the ceasefire break down.”

Both the American and French governments have privately told Israel that they believe it is violating the agreement, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the defense ministry, said in an interview with Israel’s Kan radio. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said Israel had breached the ceasefire agreement “approximately 100” times since the truce went into effect.

“Both the French and the Americans didn’t really like it,” Smotrich said, referring to Israeli strikes on Lebanon since the truce. The military has said that it acted “in response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”

Those strikes led Hezbollah to target Israeli-occupied territory, at Shebaa Farms, on Monday. If until now we separated the State of Lebanon from Hezbollah – and the entirety of Beirut from Dahiyeh, which took very hard hits – this will no longer be the case.”

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz visits the 146th Division in northern Israel, near the Lebanese border, on December 3.

Elad Malka/Israeli Ministry of Defense

It comes a day after Israel conducted airstrikes across southern Lebanon. “But the IDF, in the days since the ceasefire, is enforcing it in a very determined way, both against Hezbollah and against civilians who are trying to return to villages in the border area without permission.”

Except for Tuesday, Israel has launched daily airstrikes in Lebanon since the day after a ceasefire went into effect last week. In a statement, the group said that Israel was guilty of “firing on civilians and airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, resulting in the martyrdom of citizens and injuries to others, in addition to the continued violation of Lebanese airspace by hostile Israeli aircraft reaching the capital, Beirut.”

Hezbollah’s rockets fell in an open area and injured no one. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a serious violation of the ceasefire,” and Israel launched airstrikes across southern Lebanon, killing nine, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Smotrich said the IDF had struck 29 targets in Monday’s attack.

Israeli officials contend that far from violating the ceasefire, they are acting to enforce it.

“Yesterday was the first test – firing toward Mount Dov as if it were outside the usual conflict or open to interpretation,” Katz said on Tuesday, using the Israeli term for Shebaa Farms, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and has occupied ever since. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory."

**JERUSALEM**

An adviser to Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli media on Wednesday.

Smotrich's adviser, who is a reserve soldier in the army's Alexandroni Brigade, was wounded but was in good health condition, Israeli Channel 12 reported.

It, however, didn't reveal his name, or when he was injured.

The Israeli army has deployed four army divisions for its ongoing ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

The Israeli army said early Wednesday that three soldiers were seriously injured in clashes in southern Lebanon.

Israel has mounted massive airstrikes across Lebanon against what it claims Hezbollah targets since Sept. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

CNN reported on December 3, 2024, that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the American and French governments believe Israel is violating the agreement. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl)) <image:k>

Drop Site News, dated August 29, 2025, discusses the situation in Gaza and Lebanon, mentioning Smotrich's plan for "total victory" in Gaza. ([https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily)) <image:51> Anadolu Agency reported on October 9, 2024, that an advisor to Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The provided image shows individuals who appear to be in a public space, possibly a building. The search results mention Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, including visits to attack sites and statements about the conflict. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the "Majdal Shams attack" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) describes a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, and mentions that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visited the site. The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon)) reports on Israeli attacks on Lebanon, including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The JINSA article ([https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/](https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/)) discusses an Israeli preemptive strike against Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, but does not mention Smotrich. <image:51> <image:1>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported on December 3, 2024, that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the American and French governments believe Israel is violating the agreement. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl)) <image:k>

Drop Site News, dated August 29, 2025, discusses the situation in Gaza and Lebanon, mentioning Smotrich's plan for "total victory" in Gaza. ([https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily)) <image:51> Anadolu Agency reported on October 9, 2024, that an advisor to Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/adviser-to-israeli-finance-minister-injured-in-lebanon-clashes/3356587](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/adviser-to-israeli-finance-minister-injured-in-lebanon-clashes/3356587)) <image:i>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The provided image shows individuals who appear to be in a public space, possibly a building. The search results mention Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, including visits to attack sites and statements about the conflict. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/17/not-for-you-israeli-shelters-exclude-palestinians-as-bombs-rain-down): 
Content: The Al Jazeera article discusses Israeli bomb shelters and includes an image of people in a shelter. <image:6723>


## Elaboration
The image search provided an image of people in a bomb shelter, but it does not show Smotrich. The evidence confirms Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and that he has been involved in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and has been involved in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

Need in-depth geopolitical, security, and risk analysis of Eurasian countries and regions? This event, which occurred after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, underscores Tel Aviv’s strategic capacity to neutralise high-value targets linked to Iran-supported militant groups.

Historical context, such as the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus and the subsequent [Tehran’s retaliatory missile and drone strikes](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/04/14/iran-attack-israel-report/)
, suggests that **this escalation could provoke a powerful response from Iran**. The broader geopolitical repercussions could influence global investment patterns, with investors potentially seeking safer markets, affecting economic growth in the region.

### Background Information

Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of _Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya_ (Hamas), was killed in Tehran alongside his bodyguard after a targeted strike [on his residence](https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779)
. This rhetoric implies a possible escalation in retaliatory measures against Israeli targets, both domestically and potentially internationally.

**Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination poses a significant threat to the fragile ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas**. **_Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran; Hamas blames Israel._**
2. Haniyeh was in the city to attend the inauguration of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Hamas and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) confirmed the attack, attributing it to Israeli forces**. This incident has further inflamed the already volatile situation, raising fears of a widespread escalation that could engulf multiple countries and lead to severe humanitarian crises.

### Contextual Analysis

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran signifies a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Various international organisations and governments have criticised Haniyeh’s killing, emphasising the need for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

**The recent Israeli airstrikes in a southern suburb of Beirut, resulting in the targeted killing of Fuad Shukr**, [a senior Hezbollah commander](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwxyjydlyo)
, serves to underscore Israel’s proactive stance in neutralising perceived threats from regional adversaries."

From [Source](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/): 
Content: "However, it is unlikely to impact the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip or the negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages.

Eight hours after the preemptive targeting of senior Hizbullah military leader Fouad Shuker by the Israeli Air Force in the Al-Dahyah neighborhood of Beirut on July 30, Iran officially confirmed that Ismail Haniyeh was killed early in the morning of July 31 in Tehran, along with his bodyguard Wasim Abu Shaaban.

Hamas confirmed his death, blamed Israel, and vowed revenge.

Israel has remained silent, with Prime Minister Netanyahu instructing ministers not to comment publicly.

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killing.

Israeli intelligence sources report that Ismail Haniyeh, based in Qatar, was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7.

Accounts from Tehran state that Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed in their apartment at a guest house for foreign leaders.

The preemptive targeting was possibly by a submarine-launched missile from a distance at the bedroom where Haniyeh was staying.

This event is a double blow to both Hamas and Iran.

Haniyeh played a crucial role in managing Hamas’s political strategies, building connections throughout the Muslim world, and securing donations to fund its terror activities.

The Preemptive Targeting of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran
====================================================

A Double Blow to Hamas and Iran

Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei’s declaration on July 31, 2024.

#### Table of Contents

Iran announced the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh during his visit to Tehran, where he attended the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pazashekian.

This event is significant both operationally and morale-wise. Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, condemned the assassination, calling it “a cowardly act that will not go unpunished.”

The movement will elect a new leader to replace Haniyeh.

This is another severe blow to Hamas’s morale and operations following the killing of Muhammad Deif, the supreme commander of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza.

Yahya Sinwar, a rival of Haniyeh, is likely to benefit from this development, as he commands Hamas in Gaza and holds a crucial bargaining chip – Israeli hostages.

Hamas asserts that Haniyeh’s killing is part of an Israeli effort to pressure its leadership regarding the hostages and maintains that this will not alter its stance.

The death of Ismail Haniyeh will not end the conflict in the Gaza Strip as long as Yahya Sinwar and other members of Hamas’s military leadership remain alive.

He was a key figure in Hamas’s alignment with Shiite Iran, as opposed to Khaled Mashaal, who favors closer ties with the Sunni “Muslim Brotherhood” axis, including Qatar, Turkey, and Pakistan.

Iran faces criticism for failing to adequately protect Haniyeh on its soil, marking a significant security lapse.

This incident adds to other security failures in Iran, such as the assassination of Fakhri Mohsen Zadeh, the so-called father of Iran’s nuclear program, by the Israeli Mossad in November 2020.

Haniyeh’s decision to leave Doha, Qatar, and attend the Iranian president’s inauguration in Tehran proved fatal, providing an opportunity for Mossad to target him.

Before his death, Haniyeh met with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Islamic Jihad leader Ziad Nachala.

It is believed that the Israeli Mossad avoided targeting Haniyeh in Qatar for two reasons: Qatar’s role as a mediator in the Israeli hostages’ negotiations and operational considerations.

Hamas claims that Haniyeh’s death will not alter its campaign against Israel, which has previously seen the elimination of key leaders, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas. (res.) Maurice Hirsch](https://jcpa.org/researcher/maurice-hirsch/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination on July 31, 2024, is not confirmed by the available evidence.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.

([https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/)) <image:k> The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) reported on August 1, 2024, that Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, mentioning that Israeli intelligence sources reported Haniyeh was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on October 7. ([https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/)) <image:6741>, <image:6740>, <image:6744>, <image:6745>, <image:6746>, <image:6749>, <image:6750>, <image:6751>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported on June 17, 2025, that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran, mentioning the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> Modern Diplomacy, on August 4, 2024, discussed the assassination of Haniyeh and the potential use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, suggesting that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications. ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/))


## Elaboration
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)
 to organizations funding relief in Israel and Palestine.

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."
