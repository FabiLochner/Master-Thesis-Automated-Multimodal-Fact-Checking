## Elaboration

While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the image appears in a Business Insider article from October 10, 2023, and Getty Images stock photos, some of which predate the claimed event. The image is also associated with flight cancellations and chaos at Ben Gurion Airport due to the war with Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the image predates the claimed event and is associated with flight cancellations and chaos at Ben Gurion Airport due to the war with Gaza. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, and while a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024, the image predates this event and is associated with flight disruptions due to the war with Gaza, making the claim misleading. The image appears in a Business Insider article from October 2023 and Getty Images stock photos.
