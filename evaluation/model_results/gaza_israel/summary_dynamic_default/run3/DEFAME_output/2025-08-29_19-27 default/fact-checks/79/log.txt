Content: The Financial Times published an aerial view of the Ramat David airbase. <image:6647>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/24/hezbollah-releases-drone-video-footage-of-israeli-airbase): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on July 24, 2024, about Hezbollah releasing drone video footage of an Israeli airbase. The article includes an image of the airbase <image:6649>.

The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts the Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase after an attack by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While reports from sources like Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)) and The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)) confirm that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the airbase on that date, image searches did not yield the image in question.

So, the overall veracity is: false
