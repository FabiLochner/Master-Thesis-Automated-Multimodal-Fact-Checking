## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump's star was vandalized in the past, and Jenni Rivera's star was vandalized in July 2024. However, there is no mention of Gal Gadot's star being destroyed. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that there have been instances of vandalism on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Gal Gadot's star was destroyed. The image search and web search did not yield any results about the destruction of Gal Gadot's star.
