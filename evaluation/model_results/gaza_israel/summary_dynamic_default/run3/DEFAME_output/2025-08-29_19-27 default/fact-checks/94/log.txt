Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1247453317/gaza-baby-girl-mother-killed-israel-airstrike):

The article includes images of the baby in an incubator <image:6758>, <image:6759> and being held by a medic <image:6760>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/israel-war-gaza-cut-palestinian-life-expectancy): 
Content: The Middle East Eye published an article on April 24, 2025, discussing the impact of the war on Gaza, including the decrease in life expectancy and the impact on health facilities. The article includes images of injured Palestinians in hospitals in December 2023 and July 2024, including one of a medic helping a woman with an oxygen mask. <image:61> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from 2018 and depicts a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. The image is associated with a reported gas attack in the eastern Ghouta region of Syria, as evidenced by sources like a VOA News article ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)) and an ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
