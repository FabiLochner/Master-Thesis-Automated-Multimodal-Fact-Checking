## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, that he had been to Gaza. However, the evidence also indicates that there is no record of Trump ever visiting Gaza. He did visit Israel and the West Bank in 2017.

Therefore, Trump's statement about visiting Gaza is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The claim is that Donald Trump stated he had been to Gaza in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024. While the interview did take place and Trump made the statement, there is no record of him ever visiting Gaza.

`false`
