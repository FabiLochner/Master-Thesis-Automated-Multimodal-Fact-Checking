```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.88, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'India': 0.02, 'Palestine': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 37](media/62.jpg)) shows a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on April 12, 2025, not in Kolkata, India, as claimed. This is supported by a comparison with a Google Maps Street View image. The protest was called "March for Gaza." Another source mentions a rally in Kolkata on June 17, 2025, in solidarity with Palestine.
