Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:6675>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:6678>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs.

Return of bodies marks day of anguish for Israel

! Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday.

Protesters demanding a deal freeing hostages in Gaza gather around 27 mock coffins at Tel Aviv's Habima Square on September 5, 2024. (Noam Lehmann/Times of Israel)

About 300 people are marching from Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to the IDF headquarters on Begin Street to demand a ceasefire deal in Gaza to free hostages, kicking off a fifth straight night of protests after the IDF said Sunday it had recovered the bodies of six Israelis in Hamas hands slain days earlier.

The group carries 27 mock coffins, representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Speaking ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six slain hostages whose remains were recovered over the weekend, accuses Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shout: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann says, noting the number of days she was held captive. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

 to evade pro-Palestinian protests during the war in Gaza.

“It is deeply unfortunate that after enduring the horrific June 1 firebomb attack that resulted in the death of a community member, participants now face such persistent harassment that they must keep their gatherings secret to simply stay safe,” [tweeted](https://x.com/ADLMtnStates)
 the Anti-Defamation League of the Mountain States.

Boulder City Council member Tara Winer, who is Jewish, told 9News that she had been marching with the group several weeks ago but decided to leave after experiencing the antisemitic chants.

“I have to deal with the agitators every two weeks, if not more, and my weekend is my weekend, so I did not want to have to stand there and listen to that again,” Winer told 9News, referencing the open comment at City Council meetings. (Chet Strange/Getty Images)

The Boulder, Colorado chapter of Run For Their Lives, the Israeli hostage awareness event that was firebombed in June, will no longer publicize its demonstrations after weeks of continued threats, including from a local political candidate.

“​​Participants are facing a level of harassment that makes it impossible to continue safely in public view,” Brandon Rattiner, senior director of the local Jewish Community Relations Council, said in a statement.

The Boulder march, one of [more than 230 chapters](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/05/israel/run-for-their-lives-the-israeli-hostage-solidarity-movement-presses-on-after-colorado-firebombing)
 around the world held weekly to draw attention to the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, was attacked on [June 1](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/01/united-states/multiple-people-injured-in-boulder-colorado-attack-on-demonstration-for-israeli-hostages)
 by a man who threw Molotov cocktails at participants. Thirteen people were injured and [one 82-year-old woman later died](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/30/united-states/boulder-firebombing-victim-karen-diamond-82-dies-of-her-injuries)
.

The man accused of the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene and indicted on [12 hate crime counts](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/26/united-states/man-who-firebombed-boulder-march-for-israeli-hostages-indicted-on-hate-crime-charges)
.

Since then, anti-Israel counter-demonstrators have targeted the group, according to local Jewish leaders. Protesters have called Run For Their Lives participants “genocidal c–t,” “racist,” and “Nazi,” and mentioned the lead organizer’s children, according to videos reviewed by JCRC.

Video posted to social media by a pro-Palestinian counter-demonstrator show clashes. This individual’s comment in no way reflects the views of Run For Their Lives.” The group also said the woman accused of having made the comment did not in fact make it and that she had faced threats as a result of the video.

Aaron Stone, who is running for Boulder City Council, has been one of the more vocal counterprotesters, and allegedly called Rachel Amaru, the founder of the Boulder chapter of Run for Their Lives, a “Nazi,” according to [CBS Colorado](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/boulder-marchers-attacked-location-walks/)
.

Amaru told [9News](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/boulder-run-for-their-lives-group-antisemitism/73-0decca37-c088-4d6e-b200-c8f827705026)
 that “100% I’m being attacked because I’m Jewish,” adding that, “calling a Jew in Boulder right now a ‘Nazi’ is so over the top.”

When asked if he regretted calling Amaru a “Nazi,” Stone told CBS Colorado that he agreed “it is a very strong word to use.” But he defended protesting against the group.

“I’m not seeing a Jewish person,” Stone said. Yes, absolutely.”

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”. 

**Bianca Carrera is a freelance writer and analyst specialising in Middle Eastern and North African politics, as well as environmental matters, at Sciences Po Paris. Some days later, the party also headed a [proposal to re-establish ties](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ca/mandat-2019-2023/accio-de-govern/el-consell-municipal/acords-del-plenari/35184)
 in a council plenary session. He made clear that the move was on his agenda, but associations claim they were not told it would be a priority within his mandate. 

The group that was behind Barcelona’s solidarity campaign with Palestine, ‘Prou Complicitat’, or ‘Enough Complicity’, told _The New Arab_ that Collboni’s Socialist Party later met with the Palestine solidarity movement.

“In this meeting, they acknowledged that their reaction to the suspension was hasty and that they overreacted. \[Getty\]

**Pro-Israel interest groups and the Spanish right**

ACOM was founded in 2004 by businessman David Hatchwell, and is now presided over by the CEO of the international insurance company AmTrust Europe, Angel Mas."

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")
" as well as “flagrant and systematic violation of human rights.” The choice was made less than a year after [Barcelona's](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv")
 twinning program with St. Petersburg was stopped in opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Laporte invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against the Manchester United team as part of the European League and to give the embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

 left-wing Colau’s decision, with only her party voting in support.

On Thursday, the president of FC Barcelona invited representatives from Israel’s embassy to Spain to the soccer match against England’s Manchester United, in a sign of support for the Jewish state, according to a statement from the Israeli mission.

The statement said Joan Laporta stressed during a ceremony before the game that his team — which is popular among many Israelis — has long been committed to having good ties with Israel.

“The gesture of the Barcelona soccer team joins the wave of protests in Barcelona, Catalonia and all of Spain against the mayor’s decision,” the embassy said.

MADRID — The Spanish government on Friday criticized a decision by Barcelona’s mayor to cut the city’s ties with Israel, calling it a “unilateral move” that would not bring “anything good.”

In a letter last week to Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Barcelona’s leftist mayor Ada Colau said she had taken the step due to Israel’s “systemic violation” of the rights of the Palestinian population.

Colau, a former anti-eviction activist, cited several Israeli policies including its construction of settlements on lands claimed by the Palestinians for a future state.

“It would be a severe mistake to apply a policy of double standards and turn a blind eye to a violation that has been, for decades, widely verified and documented by international organizations,” she added.

The largely symbolic measure, which had been requested by dozens of local groups, includes the end of a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv.

Speaking at an event in Barcelona on Friday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called the move a “unilateral decision, and I understand an almost personal decision, by the mayor.”

“I believe that Barcelona’s vocation is to be an open city, as Spain is,” he added.

“I do not believe that anything good is achieved by suspending, cutting, expelling, nor is a dialogue built between Israel and Palestine,” he added.

After Colau announced last week she was suspending the twinning agreement, Madrid’s conservative Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida accused her of antisemitism and tweeted that he has written to Tel Aviv’s Mayor Ron Huldai to share “Madrid’s commitment to democracy and freedom.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with representatives from the Israeli Embassy. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, not in September 2024. The evidence also does not confirm whether the Gaza war was ongoing at the time of the meeting.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date and the context of the Gaza war.

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

The image appeared to show a news presenter from Israel’s Channel 12 standing next to a poll graphic with a Hebrew-language question that translates as: “Do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a “terrorist”?”

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:6699>](https://komonews.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

65% of Israeli Jews oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees
======================================================================================================

A shocking new poll shows that almost two out of three Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?” 

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that “they should stand criminal trial”; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn’t know.  

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B’tselem in their report “[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.” High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. They can trust the military to protect the rapists. 

The full INSS survey in Hebrew is not on the [English version](https://www.inss.org.il/publication/war-data/)

Content: "(Ayal Margolin/Flash90)

Israel is “ready to support” Lebanon’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah and will implement a phased reduction of its military presence in Lebanon as a “reciprocal measure,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Monday.

If the Lebanese Armed Forces “take the necessary steps to implement the disarmament of Hezbollah, Israel will engage in reciprocal measures, including a phased reduction of IDF presence in coordination with the US-led security mechanism,” the statement reads.

“Israel stands ready to support Lebanon in its efforts to disarm Hezbollah and to work together towards a more secure and stable future for both nations,” it continued.

The comments issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office come nine months after Israel and Lebanon reached a ceasefire deal following a year of cross-border fighting that escalated in September 2024 before the agreement was signed in November. On Monday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem reaffirmed the group’s refusal to disarm.

The Prime Minister’s Office statement praised leaders in Beirut for their “momentous decision,” calling the move “a crucial opportunity for Lebanon to reclaim its sovereignty and restore the authority of its state institutions, military, and governance—free from the influence of non-state actors.”

The statement came a day after top US envoy Tom Barrack, accompanied by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, reportedly met in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials to discuss Syria and Lebanon.

Barrack said in Beirut last week that [Israel should honor its commitments](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoy-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-next-step-as-beirut-agrees-to-disarm-hezbollah/)
 under a November 2024 ceasefire, in light of Beirut’s decision to work toward Hezbollah’s disarmament.

“I think the Lebanese government has done their part. Israel has maintained a military presence in five key points in southern Lebanon and continues to strike Hezbollah targets in the country.

On Monday, alongside the comments from Netanyahu’s office, a Hezbollah operative was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the southern Lebanon town of Tebnine, the military said.

According to the IDF, the operative was involved in restoring Hezbollah military infrastructure in the nearby town of Beit Lif, which the IDF called a violation of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. <image:6710>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250807__692M8AA__v1__HighRes__LebanonIsraelConflictHezbollahArms-1.jpg)

Supporters of Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group block the streets with burning tires as they rally in cars and motorbikes to protest the government’s endorsement of a plan to disarm it, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, early on August 8, 2025. The US also reportedly pressed Israel to consider withdrawing from one of five outposts the IDF has established inside Lebanon.

Under the November 2024 truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon were to be held only by the state, and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops from the country; however, Israel has remained in those five outposts, and Hezbollah has refused to disarm.

In his Monday speech, Qassem said that the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the November ceasefire before talks on a national defense strategy can take place. Sign in to stop seeing this](//crm.timesofisrael.com/sign-in)

Netanyahu says attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon ‘not the end of the story’

Israeli air raids on rocket sites are part of dangerous rise in hostilities, increasing fears a major conflict could erupt

Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli air raids targeting Hezbollah rockets in southern Lebanon in the early hours of Sunday morning were “not the end of the story”, after the two sides [exchanged their heaviest fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-hezbollah-attacks-what-we-know-so-far)
 since the war in Gaza began, raising fears of an all-out regional conflict.

The Israeli prime minister did not specify what further action, if any, was planned after the intense exchanges but he suggested Israel’s moves would be aimed at “changing the situation in the north”.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used 100 jet fighters that [hit more than 40 target sites inside Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-pre-emptive-strikes-lebanon-huge-hezbollah-drone-and-rocket-attack)

----------- Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel.

According to Netanyahu, the raids “destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were designed to attack our citizens and our forces in the Galilee” in northern Israel.

He also said the IDF had “intercepted all of the drones that [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 launched at a strategic target in the centre of the country”.

Netanyahu did not name the target but the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, described it as “a military intelligence base 110km inside Israeli territory” just outside Tel Aviv, an apparent reference to the Glilot military base, home to the Mossad spy agency and military intelligence agencies such as the Unit 8200 electronic surveillance section.

Two [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 fighters and a militant from an allied group were killed in the strikes on Lebanon. “And I reiterate – this is not the end of the story.”

Military observers in Israel believe that some IDF generals and the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, are in favour of further sorties against Hezbollah military positions following Sunday’s apparent success.

Gallant told IDF officers that Hezbollah had been thrown off balance by pre-emptive Israeli action minutes before the Lebanese militia was due to launch its rocket and drone attack.

“We have destabilized Hezbollah, and their operation failed,” he said, according to [Haaretz newspaper](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-25/ty-article-live/idf-launches-wave-of-lebanon-strikes-as-israel-braces-for-major-hezbollah-escalation/00000191-8715-d632-add9-b7778aa50000?liveBlogItemId=373173373#373173373)
. He added that all the drones involved had been successfully launched and had entered Israeli airspace, but did not say how many, if any, had reached their intended target.

The Hezbollah secretary general claimed the Lebanese Shia militia had decided not to respond to the [killing in late July of its commander](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says)
, Fuad Shukr, with attacks on Israeli civilians or infrastructure but to focus on exclusively military targets.

He added that Hezbollah’s arsenal of guided missiles had not been used and had not been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, so could be used in the future. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, also stressed his country did not want an all-out conflict, though it would “act according to developments on the ground”.

However, Netanyahu’s government is under persistent political pressure to create conditions in northern Israel for 80,000 displaced residents to return to their homes. They had been driven out by Hezbollah rocket and artillery fire in solidarity with Hamas, after the Palestinian militant group launched its surprise attack on Israel on 7 October last year.

“Nasrallah in Beirut and \[Iranian supreme leader\] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north, and returning our residents securely to their homes,” Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Sunday. He argued that Israel was at a “strategic crossroads” between possible negotiated solutions to the conflict in Gaza and the confrontation with Hezbollah in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

“We need to use the negotiations to bring about the release of hostages, and through the release of the hostages, also open the possibility of creating a resolution in the north, and later, to calm the region,” the defence minister said.

Meanwhile, Israel was “operating militarily and preparing as if we will not reach a resolution, and we are ready at any moment for war in the north, whatever may come”, Gallant said. The French press agency AFP quoted an unnamed US military official as saying that Washington had helped track incoming Hezbollah attacks but “was not involved in Israel’s pre-emptive strikes”.

Gallant’s office reported that the minister had talked by phone to the UK defence secretary, John Healey, to brief him on the pre-emptive airstrikes and the thwarted Hezbollah attack.

“Minister Gallant discussed the important cooperation with Britain in ensuring Israel’s security,” the ministry statement said. An Israeli navy officer was killed and two other service members injured on a patrol boat off the coast of northern Israel that was hit by shrapnel from an Iron Dome interceptor missile.

On Sunday evening the armed wing of Hamas said that it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv in response to what it said was the “Israeli massacres against civilians”.

The IDF said sirens sounded in Rishon LeTsiyon, about 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, but the rocket landed “in an open area”.

A Hamas official also said on Sunday evening that it rejected new Israeli conditions put forward in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 ceasefire talks, casting further doubt on the chances of a breakthrough in the latest US-backed effort."

War with Hezbollah was inevitable, given the Sword of Damocles it held over Israel’s head, but, as in the case of Gaza, Netanyahu was risk-averse.

His security doctrine rested on deterrence — managing the threat rather than eliminating it — because an all-out war was expected to bring massive destruction and thousands of civilian casualties. Hoping to avert a wider war, the president convinced Netanyahu to call off the attack (Netanyahu denied the report).

Hezbollah intensified its bombardment with rockets that Iron Dome could not intercept, forcing tens of thousands of Israelis in more than 40 communities along the border to evacuate. 11, which “could have changed the course of the war” and “eliminated all the chain of command of Hezbollah immediately.” However, Netanyahu opted for delay.

Even that success did not end the fighting. By year’s end, Hezbollah had fired 15,400 rockets.

As he would repeatedly, Netanyahu chose placating his right-wing coalition members over working with former President Joe Biden by rejecting a cease-fire proposal the Americans had coordinated with Israel. I said it because I firmly believe that the Lebanese people do not want war and can no longer bear its consequences or even the language of war.”

In August, Lebanon’s government decided to decommission Hezbollah’s weapons and assert full sovereignty over Southern Lebanon for the first time in more than 50 years.

Yet Hezbollah vows to resist. Most damning, as in Gaza, he misled Israelis into believing that “total victory” was possible.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

The first phase of the war, he [writes](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1710796924092129517)
 on X, involves “destroying most of the enemy forces” that have infiltrated into Israel and have killed civilians and soldiers.

Israel has also begun an offensive into Gaza “and it will continue without hesitation and without respite – until the goals are achieved.”

“We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win,” he writes.

A senior Biden administration official says on a call with reporters that the US “will treat Hamas for what they are. They are an international terrorist organization.”

Washington’s focus is currently on “ensuring that the Israelis have what they need to respond appropriately,” says the official.

The White House official says the US is ready “to offer all appropriate means of support to the people and government of Israel.”

“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.”

“We remain deeply aligned,” said the official, adding that Israel’s response is likely to continue “for some time.

The official says that that US will continue to “work with parties throughout the region” to make sure the fighting doesn’t spread from Gaza.

The official also speaks about the potential of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying that it is “premature to say the impact” that the war will have on those efforts.

“That process has a ways to travel,” says the official, adding that “terrorist groups like Hamas will not derail any such outcome.”

In a statement to Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, the terror group’s military spokesman Abu Ubaida claims that the number of hostages taken into Gaza is “many times greater than what Netanyahu thinks,” and that they are being held in various locations throughout the coastal strip.

The spokesman also urges Israel not to make “miscalculations,” adding that “whatever happens to the people of the Gaza Strip, will happen to \[the hostages\].”

Israel is now facing a deep crisis after witnessing the heroism of Hamas militants, Abu Ubaida says, adding that Israeli soldiers fell before them “like locusts.”

He vows that Hamas will continue the ongoing operation on all fronts.

Eleven Nepalese agricultural students have been injured, two of them seriously, in the Hamas attack on southern Israel, according to a statement by the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Nepal’s ambassador to Israel tells CNN that when the attack began, the students were working on a farm in the area. They hid in a bomb shelter but that building was taken over by Hamas.

Separate unconfirmed reports in the Hindustani Times and India Today state that some Nepalese students are also among those who have been taken hostage by Hamas.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

“In Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,” Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. “The federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.”

Germany’s authorities are also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,” she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country’s regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

“At a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,” he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a “visible and systematic static presence,” and the use of soldiers from France’s Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group’s onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must “leave our occupied lands.”

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that “we are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.”

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.”

Martin says he could “see tensions rising” during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking.”

“We believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,” he says.

“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,” he says.

“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it’s a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today’s attack.”

The decision applies to Israel’s magistrates, district and labor courts, as well as the Supreme Court and the rabbinical courts.

Hearings scheduled for parole committees on Sunday will be postponed to a later date.

The statement condemns “the recent unprovoked and continuous attacks by Israel on Palestinian towns, cities, and refugee camps” as well as “the inhumane siege imposed on the nearly 2 million inhabitants of Gaza,” which the organization says is “an implied declaration of open war on the Palestinians which oblige them to be in constant self-defense.”

The organization calls on the US government “to exert pressure on the occupation regime to immediately cease these atrocities” and criticizes any Arab and Muslim nations that have normalized relations with Israel.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he has spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and is urging him to take steps toward calming the situation.

According to the US State Department, Blinken calls “on all leadership in the region to condemn” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and also urges the PA to “enhance steps to restore calm and stability in the West Bank.”

Today in Ramallah, Abbas chaired an emergency leadership meeting of the Palestinian Authority, and according to the official news agency Wafa, “gave instructions to provide protection for the Palestinian people, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terrorism of settlers and the occupation forces.”

Abbas also “gave directions to provide all that is necessary to bolster the resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people in facing the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation and settler gangs.”

Netanyahu says the army is currently clearing Hamas terrorists from everywhere they infiltrated, going house to house, “restoring control to our hands.”

He sends love and condolences to all the bereaved families that lost loved ones “brutally murdered in cold blood.” He prays for the recovery of the injured.

And he warns Hamas that Israel will hold it responsible for the hostages it has taken. “Israel will avenge anyone who is harmed,” he says, “in so much as a hair on their head.”

He says Israel stands in solidarity with residents of the south, who stood firm and fought bravely.

He praises the security forces, calling them the latest in the long history of Israel’s war heroes.

“You are fighting now for all of our homes, for all of our futures,” he says.

“We are all with you, we all love you, we all salute you.”

He praises the members of the emergency services, and says their spirit will help overcome our enemies.

He says he spoke with President Biden and other world leaders from France, Britain and beyond, thanks Biden for his “unreserved support,” and says he secured international backing for “freedom of action” for Israel.

Netanyahu says all Israelis “are in this together. It will take time. It will be hard. We have challenging days ahead of us.”

But he promises that “with God’s help, with our combined strength, and with our belief in an eternal Israel, we will win.”

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use “all the power” of the IDF to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, and tells Gaza’s residents to “get out now.”

Calling today’s events something “never before seen in Israel,” he vows to ensure “it will never happen again.”

He begins by saying Hamas “invaded Israeli territory this morning,” and started a “cruel and evil war,” targeting innocent civilians young and old.

“We will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,” he says.

“Hamas wants to murder us all,” Netanyahu says, “murdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

“It is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,” an enemy “that massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.”

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its power to destroy Hamas’s capabilities,” he says. “We will fight them to the bitter end and avenge this black day they plotted for Israel and its people.”

Israel will target Hamas everywhere — turning the places it “hides and operates” into “cities of ruin.”

He tells the “residents of Gaza” to “get out now because we will operate everywhere and with full force.”

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 250, Hebrew-language media reports say, citing medical officials.

The toll is expected to continue to rise.

At least 1,450 have been wounded, many seriously.

Dozens of civilians as well as IDF soldiers are believed to have been abducted and brought into Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

US President Joe Biden backs Israel’s right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

“Today the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we’ll make sure that they’ll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,” Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“The world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities… Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s unconscionable.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.”

“It’s also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It’s heartbreaking.”

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to “make sure Israel has what it needs.”

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

“Let there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,” Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

“He was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else — including today, on this tragic morning,” says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, “I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.”

“Today’s violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population… are in themselves an aggression,” Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a “colonial” entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

“I am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,” he says. “Violence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.”

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemns the terror attacks.

“I am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,” Türk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn’t been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

At the time, Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn’t understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They’d last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

“He had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,” said Polin, who didn’t know anything specific about his son’s plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn’t usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son’s who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night “nature party” near Kibbutz Re’im.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

“One list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,” Polin says. “But he wasn’t at any of those places.”

Friends were at the couple’s home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven’t been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

“They think there’s still a bunch of people hiding in the area,” Polin says, adding that the mother of his son’s friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. “Every time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There’s very little we can actually do.”

The Israel Defense Forces says it struck another two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip, used by Hamas.

The “Palestine” building was used by a number of Hamas units, including intelligence, weapon production, and offices of senior members, the IDF says.

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas’s general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri (YouTube screenshot)

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group’s onslaught against Israel an “open battle” aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived “desecration” of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims — by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified “new reality” at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are “about to be freed,” anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are “senior officers.” He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians “humanely.” Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

“We have a plan for all stages of this conflict,” al-Arouri says, “both in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.” He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the “best scenario” for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his “hope and trust” that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight “to defend Al-Aqsa,” especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

“We entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,” he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon’s territory.

Yair Lapid (L), Benny Gantz (C) and Benjamin Netanyahu (R) (Flash90)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposes that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency government following Hamas’s devastating surprise attack Saturday morning.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would “deal with security challenges alone” and in a manner that would allow “substantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums” for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing “for any responsible and determined security action.”

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join “a reduced, professional, emergency government” and says it would be impossible to manage a war with “the extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,” essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

The Magen David Adom ambulance service said in Rishon Lezion, medics treated two men aged 28 who were seriously hurt.

In Yavne, a 73-year-old woman was seriously hurt and a 77-year-old man was lightly hurt, MDA says.

In Bat Yam, a 24-year-old man was moderately hurt, MDA says.

In Tel Aviv, four people were wounded, including one in moderate condition, MDA adds.

The victims are being taken to hospitals in the area.

Hamas claimed to have launched 150 rockets from the Gaza Strip at Tel Aviv in the barrage.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

“At this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,” the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the “gigantic failure” of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, “at this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.”

The White House slams a Republican “disinformation” campaign blaming the Biden administration for today’s Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

“Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,” she adds.

The Health Ministry says 1,104 people have been wounded in the attacks, which included Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

The death toll is expected to rise higher.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points, overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Thirteen hours after the start of the attacks, there are reported to still be 22 “active” areas in southern Israel, where gunmen are still active or feared to be in the field.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Energy Minister Israel Katz signs an order instructing the Israel Electric Corporation to cut the supply of electricity to Gaza.

“It’s not going to be how it was,” Katz says in a statement.

Gaza largely relies on Israel and fuel imports for its power.

Turkey’s Foreign Ministry declines to condemn Hamas or say the word “terrorism,” saying only that they “are deeply concerned about the violence and tension occurred \[sic\] in Israel and Palestine today.”

“We attach high importance to the restoration of calm in the region as soon as possible, and strongly condemn the loss of civilian lives. We underline that acts of violence and associated escalations will not benefit anyone, and call on the parties to act with restraint and avoid impulsive steps.”

Ankara also urges “the parties” to work toward a two-state solution.

Magen David Adom thanks the Israeli public for its huge response to the call for blood donations for treating war victims at Israel’s hospitals. Thousands of units of blood were donated at the many MDA donation sites around the country.

As of 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, MDA says it has enough blood supply for the time being and has asked people to hold off on donating until tomorrow or later in the week.

At Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv alone, 650 individuals showed up to donate blood. Overwhelmed by the turnout, Ichilov announced that it had closed its blood donation station until further notice.

The Israel Defense Forces has regained control of the Re’im military base in southern Israel, which houses the Gaza Division, from Hamas terrorists, according to Hebrew-language media reports.

Earlier, the IDF said it was fighting Hamas terrorists at 22 different locations in southern Israel.

The military has been sweeping the towns where the terrorists infiltrated, reaching civilians who have been holed up for more than 12 hours.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Sérgio França Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

“It is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,” Erdan writes.

“Israel expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas’ war crimes and genocidal agenda.”

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

“The State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” he writes. “We will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.”

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be’eri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom’s Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

The European Union “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and stressed Israel’s right to self defense.

“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence,” says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a statement issued on behalf of all 27 member states, “which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.”

Borrell says the EU “stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks.”

A man says his wife, two young children and mother-in-law have been taken to Gaza and that he has seen them in a video from the coastal enclave.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife’s phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

“I have seen my wife’s phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “I contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don’t know what’s going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.”

Israeli activists in the US launch a crowdfunding campaign to assist residents of southern Israel.

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

“We join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,” organizers say. “This is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.”

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

The Israeli consulate in New York also says it is accepting all offers of help and support.

“The Hamas terrorist organization deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF says.

“Prior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,” the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an “emergency government” to manage “the difficult and complex operation ahead of us” after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

“The State of Israel is at war. It won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,” Lapid says in an announcement.

“A short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I’m willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.”

Netanyahu, he says, “knows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can’t manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.”

“Forming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,” says Lapid.

“The State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren’t managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won’t deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.”

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that “the offer is real, this isn’t a political thing. The offer is there.”

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

“The IDF and defense establishment are currently operating to defeat the enemy and to defend our citizens. We are prepared to widen our operations,” Gallant tells Austin.

During the call, which was requested by Secretary Austin, Gallant details recent events in Israel and operations carried out by the IDF and defense establishment, his office says.

Gallant says Israel is currently at war, and has been facing terror attacks against its citizens since this morning – this includes men, women, children and elderly individuals.

“The State of Israel will win this war, and Hamas will be held responsible for its actions,” his office says.

Gallant thanks Austin and the US Administration for their support for Israel.

US President Joe Biden says he told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on their phone call earlier today, “we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and people of Israel.”

“Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering,” Biden says in a statement condemning this morning’s surprise Hamas attack on southern and central Israel.

“Jill and I are keeping in our prayers all of the families who have been hurt by this violence. We are heartbroken by the lives that have been tragically cut short and hope for a swift recovery for all those who have been wounded,” he adds.

“My team and I are tracking this situation closely, and I will remain in close touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Biden says.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Hamas’s surprise attack on southern and central Israel this morning.

“The secretary-general is appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes,” says a statement from his spokesperson.

Guterres “is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times.”

“The secretary-general urges all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration,” the statement continues. “He stresses that violence cannot provide a solution to the conflict, and that only through negotiation leading to a two-state solution can peace be achieved.”

Now that the IDF has confirmed that Israeli civilians and soldiers have been kidnapped and taken as hostages to Gaza, Israeli television is showing heavily pixelated clips that have been running for hours on social media.

The clips appear to show Israelis being abducted on foot and in vehicles, and were apparently filmed inside Israel and inside Gaza.

Many of the clips are too gruesome to broadcast.

By [Amanda Borschel-Dan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/amanda-borschel-dan/ "Amanda Borschel-Dan")

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

“I think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse — of their ending” — that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. “Everyone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.”

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are “not even relevant anymore,” he says, and negotiations “under or over the table” will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel’s northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

“Either they’re going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,” he says.

“Starting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties… but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

“It’s the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn’t go into a major ground operation, it’s the end of this government’s political life,” says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be’eri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is “completely unified.”

“I want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,” he says. “All Israel’s citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.”

“There is no coalition and opposition now,” Gantz adds, “just a single fist that will pound the enemy.”

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part “will be making a terrible mistake.”

“It must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen… and pray for the recovery of all the injured.”

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. “Israel can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,” Gantz says.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s attack on Israel rises to more than 100, Hebrew-language media cite medical officials as saying.

The number is seen as certain to rise further.

Some 800 people have been wounded in the attacks, which have included hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

Sporadic rocket fire continues against towns close to the border with the Gaza Strip.

The rate of rocket fire from Gaza appears to have slowed in the last hour, with sirens sounding in several communities.

The Israeli military is still focusing on fighting Hamas terrorists still in Israeli territory.

Ra’am’s Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra’am party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: “In light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.”

“I urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.”

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing “lots of gunfire” nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife’s phone — which doesn’t answer — to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving “far more successful” from Hamas’s perspective than it would have expected, the TV station’s Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn’t know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a “proud operation.”

“We support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,” Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

“We support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,” says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists “until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

“Today’s operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,” he says.

“The resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people’s struggle against the Zionists.”

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “Down with Israel,” “Down with America,” and “Welcome Palestine,” according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

The Walla news site says Swiss Air, Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines are among the companies to cancel flights to and from Israel.

Over nine hours since the Hamas terror group launched a deadly assault on Israel with terrorists infiltrating from land, air and sea, there are still gunmen in a number of Israeli communities.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire — while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

Saudi Arabia calls for an “immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint” amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‘repeatedly warned’ of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its “repeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a “credible peace process” to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden are expected to speak in the next hour amid a massive and deadly attack by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded as terrorists infiltrated from Gaza into Israeli towns, and thousands of rockets were launched at the south and center of the country.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

“Today we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day. Innocent civilians were massacred and wounded, and many are still under attack,” Herzog says in a statement.

“The State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,” he says.

“I call upon the family of nations – this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran. Now is the time to stand firm with Israel in support of its just and moral battle in the face of an abhorrent enemy,” he says.

Security forces are fighting terrorists in at least four areas in the town, the broadcaster reports.

“We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to alarms, we thought it was the usual rocket attacks but we started hearing gunshots on the street, sounded like it came from the parking of our building. Then we realized something was unusual. We then started seeing Hamas people in pickup trucks. They knocked on the homes of residents, who thought they were Israeli soldiers. They took them hostage,” says Kahlon.

“There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks,” Watson says.

The mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, says his city is still under attack.

“Don’t open the doors, stay inside, close the windows… we’re still searching the area,” he tells local residents via Channel 12.

He says the Hamas leadership, from Ismael Haniyeh on down, are “animals” who “must be harmed and killed.”

The people of Israel “haven’t yet seen” what’s happened in the city, he says — “inhuman acts” against innocent people. The terrorists have to be “wiped out,” he says.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are “murderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.”

“People still don’t understand the numbers” and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many “bodies on the ground… terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.”

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

At least 40 people have been killed and over 700 injured since the start of the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, the Magen David Adom emergency service says.

The Health Ministry says 779 people have been hospitalized.

Terror cells from the Gaza group have infiltrated a number of communities in the south of the country.

In addition, thousands of rockets have been fired at the center and south.

The assault has been ongoing since approximately 6:30 a.m.

The death toll is expected to rise.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a statement at the start of the security cabinet meeting, calling for all the citizens of the country to unite.

“Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first goal is first of all to cleanse the area of the enemy forces that have infiltrated, and restore security and peace to the settlements that were attacked,” Netanyahu says.

“The second goal, at the same time, is to exact a huge price from the enemy, also in the Gaza Strip,” he says.

“The third goal is to fortify other arenas so that no one makes the mistake of joining this war,” Netanyahu says.

“We are at war, in war, you have to keep calm. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war,” the premier says.

The official name for the campaign by the Israel Defense Forces amid the devastating Hamas attack is Operation Swords of Iron.

Ukraine’s President writes a long post condemning the devastating Hamas terror assault on Israel and says that all its details should be revealed to the world.

Here is the post in full:

“Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

“Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

“Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

“Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable.

“All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

“All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

“To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”

Channel 12 broadcasts footage from earlier this morning apparently showing a bulldozer breaking through the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Dozens of terrorists from the Hamas terrorist group infiltrated into Israel by land, air and sea, going on deadly rampages through border communities.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

“This is against international law,” he writes. “Hostages must be released immediately.”

European leaders roundly condemn the massive assault by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Hamas contributes to “the intensification of violence,” adding Israel “has our full solidarity” and “the right, guaranteed by international law, to defend itself against terrorism.”

France expresses “full solidarity with Israel and the victims” and underscored “its absolute rejection of terrorism and its commitment to Israel’s security.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he “firmly condemns” the attacks.

Italy also backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack.”

Britain’s foreign minister James Cleverly condemns the “horrific attacks” and underlined Israel’s right to self-defense.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says: “Appalling images from Israel. Terror organization Hamas is waging an unprecedented attack on Israel… This violence must stop; Israel has every right to defend itself.”

Spain says it is “shocked by the indiscriminate violence” of the attacks on Israel while Ukraine and the Czech Republic say they back Israel’s right to defend itself.

The European Union “unequivocally” condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she “unequivocally” condemns the “terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,” adding that it was “terrorism in its most contemptible form.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,” she adds.

“This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.

European Council president Charles Michel also condemns the “indiscriminate attacks launched against Israel and its people this morning inflicting terror and violence against innocent citizens.”

“My thoughts are with all the victims. EU stands in solidarity with Israeli people in this horrific moment.”

The Israel Defense Forces announces it is canceling schools in central and southern Israel, meaning roughly 1 million children will stay home tomorrow, amid ongoing fighting between Israel and terror groups in the Gaza Strip.

All schools south of Netanya and north of the central Negev are to be closed and businesses can only be opened if there is ready access to bomb shelters, the military says.

Gatherings are also restricted to 10 people outdoors and 50 people indoors in those areas, the IDF Home Front Command says.

The restrictions are valid till Sunday at 6 p.m., but will likely be extended further amid the fighting.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, says Israel is “in a state of war” following Hamas’s surprise attack.

“The IDF has declared a state of war. We are in a state of war,” Hagari says in a live video statement.

“More than 2,000 rockets have been fired. Terrorists infiltrated, and some are still in Israel,” he says.

“The IDF is flooding the area with troops. We are focusing on the fighting on the Gaza border,” Hagari continues.

“We have begun a widespread call-up in all parts of the IDF. The Air Force is also striking in Gaza,” he adds.

Hezbollah praises the massive Hamas operation against Israel, and says it is message to Arab countries normalizing with Israel.

The terror group Hezbollah says it is in direct contact with the Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad, and calls on Arab and Muslim peoples around the world to declare their support to Hamas and the Palestinian people, adding that armed resistance is the only way to confront the Israeli “aggression.”

Hezbollah adds that the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” operation launched by Hamas against Israel is a message to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world, in particular those countries seeking normalization with Israel.

It also calls on the Israeli government to learn the “important lessons” taught by the “Palestinian resistance.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement on October 7, 2023 (Screen grab)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives his first public statement on the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, saying the country is at war.

“Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” he says. “And we will win.”

“The enemy will pay a price like they have never known before,” he says, in his first public statement on the matter, some five hours since the start of the assault by the Gaza-based terror group.

There are reports of a number of dead and nearly 300 wounded as terrorists infiltrate a number of southern towns and thousands of rockets are fired at the center and south of the country.

Israeli residents near the Gaza Strip continue to ask for help and report on shooting by terrorists inside the towns while there is little or no IDF presence on the streets.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: “They are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.”

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

“I don’t understand how this is still going on. We’re in this situation since 6 a.m.,” she says. “Four people cannot fight them off alone

“Send help, please,” she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources. In an Instagram story timed to 9:55 a.m. cited by Ynet, a resident of Kfar Gaza writes: “I’m begging you!!! We can’t catch anyone! There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!”

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: “With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel’s “desecration” of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,” he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” — countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran — to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nations to join “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: “Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel’s Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.”

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah’s statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Another article from India.com, published on October 22, 2024, reports that Hezbollah fired rockets at Tel Aviv ([https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/](https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/)). The Times of Israel also features the image in a live blog about the ongoing attacks on Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/)).

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:62>)
web_search("man orange jacket rubble")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. The earthquake occurred on February 6 or 7, 2023. The photo was taken by Adem Altan, a photographer with AFP.

The image was published by The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)), SBS News ([https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl)). <image:62>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a photo of a man in an orange jacket walking through rubble, available on Vecteezy ([https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/59962955-a-man-in-an-orange-jacket-and-hard-hat-is-walking-through-rubble](https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/59962955-a-man-in-an-orange-jacket-and-hard-hat-is-walking-through-rubble)). The search also shows various orange jackets and vests for men from LLBean.com (<image:4736>, <image:4737>, <image:4740>, <image:4741>, <image:4743>, <image:4744>, <image:4745>, <image:4746>, <image:4747>, <image:4749>, <image:4750>, <image:4751>, <image:4752>, <image:4753>, <image:4754>, <image:4755>, <image:4756>, <image:4757>, <image:4758>, <image:4759>).

Additionally, Freepik provides an AI-generated image of a man in an orange and black jacket walking through rubble (<image:4775>).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, after an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023, not a bombing in Gaza in July 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a man holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023. The claim misrepresents the context of the image, stating it depicts a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024.

`false`

The UNRWA Media Advisor Adnan Abu Hasna told Al Jazeera he estimated that the number of displaced people sheltering at the school stood at 2000 however this figure was far too low according to other experts on the ground.

In the background of the page, a satellite image of Nuseirat shows the location of a building with 1 hostage, and a nearby building with 3 hostages.

On June 8, Israel conducted one of the most high-risk operations of the war — a rescue in broad daylight of four hostages held by Hamas in Nuseirat, a densely populated area.

Israel achieved that goal, but within minutes, the operation escalated into a firefight and a series of airstrikes that killed scores of people. The New York Times was not able to verify which came first.

The background satellite image of Nuseirat highlights multiple buildings that were damaged or destroyed near the two locations where hostages were held.

The Times analysis — using satellite images, witness accounts and more than 60 videos — revealed that the strikes destroyed or damaged at least 42 buildings. The areas hit included apartment buildings and a crowded market, helping to explain the high death toll.

Palestinian health officials said 274 people were killed, including 64 children. In press statements, Israeli officials said that Hamas was holding the hostages in civilian apartment buildings and firing from civilian areas, making it “impossible” to rescue the captives without harming bystanders.

Pointing to the death toll — and that Hamas held hostages in an area populated by civilians — Jeremy Laurence, a United Nations human rights office spokesperson, said in a [statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2024/06/shock-impact-civilians-israeli-raid-gaza-free-hostages)
 that “all these actions, by both parties, may amount to war crimes.”

Firefight Amid Hostage Rescue
-----------------------------

Around 11 a.m., Israeli special forces entered two low-rise apartment buildings about 250 yards apart. They rescued Noa Argamani, 26, from [one of them](https://x.com/NemoAnno/status/1802647117732671849)
 and drove her three miles to a waiting helicopter on the Gazan coast.

On the satellite map, a video of the building where three hostages were being held is added at the geolocated site of the building.

At 11:15 a.m., video released by the Israeli police shows that a heavy gunfight broke out near the building where three men — Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41 — were being held by a man who had worked for the [Hamas-affiliated news ag](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza.html)
