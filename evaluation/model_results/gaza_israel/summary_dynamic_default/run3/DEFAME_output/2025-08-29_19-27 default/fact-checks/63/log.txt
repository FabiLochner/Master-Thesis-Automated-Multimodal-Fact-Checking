Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents): 
Content: PBS News published an article on March 20, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. <image:6472> A month-old girl was pulled from the rubble, but her parents and brother were dead. The article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023, and that Israel's offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-67843832): 
Content: The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble in Rafah after an Israeli air strike. The air strike killed her mother and sister. The article also mentions that over 21,500 people, mostly children and women, have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza. <image:6473>, <image:6474>, <image:6478>, <image:6480>, <image:6484>, <image:6486>, <image:6488>, <image:6492>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.democracynow.org/2025/5/27/dr_alaa_al_najjar_gaza): 
Content: Democracy Now! published an article on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike on the home of a Palestinian pediatrician in Gaza, killing nine of her ten children. <image:6505> The article mentions emergency workers pulling the charred bodies of the children from the rubble.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of mummified children from a Bolivian museum, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-)). While there have been reports of children being found in the rubble in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes, the image is unrelated to those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
