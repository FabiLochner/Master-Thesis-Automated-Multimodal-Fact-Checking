## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that President Joe Biden was photographed exiting Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine." The book's subtitle is "A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017." The provided sources, including JNS.org, Jewish Insider, and Fox News, confirm this.

The evidence does not explicitly state the exact date in late November 2024. However, the Fox News article mentions the event occurred during a Black Friday shopping excursion, which typically falls in late November.

Therefore, the claim is likely accurate, pending confirmation of the exact date.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that President Joe Biden was photographed exiting Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine." The provided sources support this. While the exact date in late November 2024 is not explicitly stated, the context of a Black Friday shopping excursion suggests the timeframe is accurate.
