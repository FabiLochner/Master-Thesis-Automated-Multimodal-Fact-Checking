Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It contains a post titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" which discusses Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, and includes an image of a man in a hijab. The post references a tweet that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise, suggesting an escape tactic after reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes comments from other users discussing the situation. <image:57> is included in the post. The post was published on June 26, 2025.

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is based on an image that has been associated with rumors and speculation about Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. While the image has circulated in the context of alleged Israeli attacks and potential disguises, there is no definitive evidence to confirm its authenticity. The evidence includes a [Nairaland forum post](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape/1) discussing the image in the context of Qaani's alleged escape, and articles mentioning rumors and reports of his disappearance and death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
