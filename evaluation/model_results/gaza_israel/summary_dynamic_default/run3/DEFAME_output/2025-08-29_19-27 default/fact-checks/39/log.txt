Content: Fact Crescendo states that the image is miscaptioned. <image:6151>

The claim '<image:27> This image shows an athlete of China which has chosen a design of the Palestinian flag for the Paris 2024 Olympics.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. The image in the claim is from the September 2023 issue of Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics, as confirmed by [Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/china-has-not-chosen-a-design-inspired-by-the-palestinian-flag-for-the-paris-olympics-2024/) and [Factly.in](https://factly.in/an-old-photo-from-vogue-china-magazine-is-being-falsely-shared-as-showing-chinese-athletes-wearing-the-colours-of-the-palestinian-flag/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
