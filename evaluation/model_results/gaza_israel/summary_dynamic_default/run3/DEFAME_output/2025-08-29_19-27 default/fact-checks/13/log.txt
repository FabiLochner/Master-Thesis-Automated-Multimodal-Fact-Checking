	1. September 13, 2024 https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024
Useful result: From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an Iran Update on September 13, 2024, discussing the conflict between Israel and Iranian-backed groups. The report mentions an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, which the US Embassy assessed was likely conducted by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. <image:5913> The report also mentions attacks by Lebanese Hezbollah into northern Israel. The IDF killed three senior PIJ fighters in a drone strike in the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm on September 11. The report also mentions the departure of the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group from the CENTCOM area.

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were attacks in Baghdad around the time frame mentioned, the image cannot be verified as depicting a US facility under attack on September 30, 2024. The image search did not return any relevant results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
