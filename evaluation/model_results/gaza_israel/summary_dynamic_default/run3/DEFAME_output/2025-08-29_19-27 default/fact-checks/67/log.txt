Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence): 
Content: The PBS News article, published on July 23, 2025, discusses Syria's request for defense support from Turkey following sectarian violence and Israeli intervention. <image:6612> The article mentions that Turkey is working to provide training and technical support to Syria. It also notes that tensions have increased between Turkey and Israel, with Israel accusing Turkey of trying to build a "protectorate" in Syria. The article also mentions that in March, over 1,400 civilians were killed in sectarian violence in coastal Syria. The article also mentions that the U.S. envoy to Syria announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The evidence from multiple sources, including [en.majalla.com](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria), [www.timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/), and [www.aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/4/syrias-al-sharaa-meets-erdogan-to-talk-kurdish-fighters-defence-pacts), reveals discussions and actions related to the relationship between Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in 2025, including meetings, airstrikes, and calls for deconfliction. However, none of the provided evidence supports the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
