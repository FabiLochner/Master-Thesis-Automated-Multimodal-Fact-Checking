Content: The International Court of Justice published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The court found that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. The court also stated that Israel is obligated to end its unlawful presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. Furthermore, the court stated that all states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

Content: The International Court of Justice delivered an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory on December 19, 2024. The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion. The General Assembly requested the ICJ to render an advisory opinion in December 2022. The UN website also provides links to the report in multiple languages. The report discusses legal measures seeking accountability for violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in the International Court of Justice.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/): 
Content: The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The article mentions the UN General Assembly's resolution that gave effect to the ICJ's opinion. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations. The article also discusses the dire humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. <image:756>

The claim 'Israel has been declared an illegal state by the International Court of Justice in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful and obligating it to end its presence and cease settlement activities, as detailed in the [ICJ summary](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176) and discussed in a [Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect article](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/). However, the ICJ's ruling focused on the illegality of Israel's presence and policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, not on declaring Israel an illegal state.

So, the overall veracity is: false
