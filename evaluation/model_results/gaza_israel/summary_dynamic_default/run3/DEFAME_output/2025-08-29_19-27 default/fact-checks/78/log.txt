Content: The Times of Israel reported that on October 1, 2024, Iran launched a ballistic missile barrage at Israel.

The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu's home was targeted by a drone attack later that month, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024. The provided sources, such as the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-meeting-moved-to-secure-underground-location-after-drone-attack-on-pms-home/) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), detail the attacks but do not mention Netanyahu's departure to Poland.

So, the overall veracity is: false
