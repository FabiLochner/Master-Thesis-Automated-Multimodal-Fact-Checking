## Claim
Claim: "![image 53](media/84.jpg) This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
web_search("Benjamin Netanyahu house drone image")
reverse_search(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an NPR article published on October 19, 2024, a drone targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel. The article mentions that Hezbollah carried out rocket attacks on Israel. The Guardian also reported on October 19, 2024, that Netanyahu's house was hit by a drone, causing superficial damage.

A CNN article published on October 23, 2024, reported on a drone strike on Benjamin Netanyahu's beach house in Caesarea, Israel, claimed by Hezbollah. The article includes an image of the house (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) and shows damage to the exterior. The attack occurred on October 22, 2024.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) of Benjamin Netanyahu's house dates back to 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and was featured in a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019.

_Times of Israel_ published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in Caesarea.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. The image does depict Benjamin Netanyahu's house. However, the image was taken before August 2024. The reverse image search indicates that the image was taken in 2019. The web search confirms that a drone strike occurred in October 2024, but the image itself predates this event.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it was taken before August 2024. The claim is therefore inaccurate regarding the date the image was taken.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as confirmed by a CNN article ([CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/)). However, the image was taken before August 2024, as evidenced by a reverse image search that found the image in a 2019 YouTube video and a 2020 _Times of Israel_ article. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date the image was taken.
