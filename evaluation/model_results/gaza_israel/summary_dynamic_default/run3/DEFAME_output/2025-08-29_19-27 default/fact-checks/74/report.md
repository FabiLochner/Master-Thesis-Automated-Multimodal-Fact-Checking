[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216) also reported on the drone strike, confirming that Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building and there were no casualties.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on October 19, 2024, reporting a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, Israel, with Hezbollah being behind the attack. The article states that Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time and no one was injured. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl4e7w2e7o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl4e7w2e7o)) ![image 6628](media/2025-08-29_20-00-1756497649-211328.jpg)

CNN reported on a drone strike on October 22, 2024, that damaged Benjamin Netanyahu's beach house in Caesarea, Israel, with Hezbollah claiming responsibility for the attack. The article mentions that Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time and no one was injured.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, the evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is false.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, but it also explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is directly contradicted by the evidence.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), the attack resulted in no injuries, and Netanyahu and his wife were not present.
