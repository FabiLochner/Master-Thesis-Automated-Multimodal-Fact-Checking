The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Kamala Harris said, "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, cannot be verified. While Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu around that time and discussed Israel, the exact quote is not found in the provided sources, including reports from CNN, The Washington Post, Reuters, and NPR ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address), [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/), [https://www.npr.org/2024/07/25/nx-s1-5048285/harris-gaza-war](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/25/nx-s1-5048285/harris-gaza-war)).
