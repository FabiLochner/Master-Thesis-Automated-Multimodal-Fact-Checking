The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. A fact-check from ABC10, published in 2025, explicitly states that the US did not reinstitute the military draft for the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)).
