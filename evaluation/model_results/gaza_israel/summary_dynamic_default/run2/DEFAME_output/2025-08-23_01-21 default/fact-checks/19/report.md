The Guardian published a live blog on July 7 and 8, 2025, covering Donald Trump's meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, amid indirect talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. The article also mentions Trump calling Musk's new political party 'ridiculous'.

France 24 reported on February 5, 2025, that an AI-generated photo of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 16](media/19.jpg)) was circulating on social media, debunking the claim that the image is authentic. NDTV.com, in January 2025, discussed Elon Musk's praise for Donald Trump's negotiation skills.
