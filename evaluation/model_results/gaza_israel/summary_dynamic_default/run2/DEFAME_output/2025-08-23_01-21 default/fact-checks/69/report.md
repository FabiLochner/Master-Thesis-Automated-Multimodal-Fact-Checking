### Evidence from `web_search`
The Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php)) discusses Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, including a ground incursion into Daraa, specifically mentioning the IDF entering the town of Tasil. FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa)) reports on Israeli military operations in the Tasil area near Nawa, Syria, in April 2025, including ground incursions. The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/2025-04-03/live-updates-848643](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/2025-04-03/live-updates-848643)) mentions clashes near Daraa and an image of the Israel Air Force striking a Hamas weapons facility in Syria on February 9, 2025. ![image 42](media/69.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The web search results confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including ground incursions into Tasil. However, the provided sources mention these events occurring in April 2025, not February 2025, as stated in the claim. The geolocation data does not provide any information about the location of the image.

Therefore, the claim is likely inaccurate regarding the date.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate because the provided evidence indicates that the events described occurred in April 2025, not February 2025. The image itself is not directly verified, but the context of Israeli military activity in the area is supported by multiple sources.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is inaccurate. While the evidence confirms Israeli military activity, including ground incursions, in the Daraa region, specifically in Tasil, the provided sources indicate these events occurred in April 2025, not February 2025, as stated in the claim. See [Security Council Report](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php) and [FRANCE 24](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa).
