## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel reports that the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa. Neguise has served as ambassador since August 2024. (![image 4997](media/2025-08-23_01-27-1755912471-304388.jpg), <image:i>)

The Anadolu Agency published an article on April 7, 2025, stating that Israelâ€™s ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference in Addis Ababa.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa in April 2025. The Anadolu Agency and Tasnim News Agency both reported this event on April 7, 2025. The Times of Israel also reported on the removal.

The claim states that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador, but the evidence only mentions the ambassador's removal from a conference. It is unclear whether this removal constitutes an expulsion.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the exact nature of the removal (expulsion vs. other forms of removal) needs further clarification.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Ethiopian News Agency ([https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848)) reported on April 2, 2025, that the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, stated Israel's commitment to strengthening ties with Ethiopia. Fana Media Corporation ([https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/](https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/)) published an article on April 3, 2025, with a similar statement from Ambassador Negussie. <image:42142/0/ISrael.png/d0c3184a-06c2-cc12-01ea-e163231db132?version=1.0&t=1743591156522&download=true>, ![image 5051](media/2025-08-23_01-29-1755912546-305304.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence shows that on April 2 and 3, 2025, the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, expressed Israel's commitment to strengthening ties with Ethiopia. This contradicts the claim that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador in April 2025. While the previous evidence indicated the ambassador's removal from a conference, these new reports suggest that he was still active in his role around the same time.

The claim is therefore likely false, as the ambassador was actively engaged in diplomatic efforts in early April 2025, despite being removed from a conference. The nature of the removal from the conference remains unclear, but it does not appear to have been a complete expulsion from the country.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia was removed from an African Union conference in April 2025. However, the ambassador was also reported to be actively engaged in diplomatic efforts around the same time. The claim that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador is not directly supported by the evidence, and the ambassador's continued activity suggests the claim is false.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia was removed from an African Union conference in April 2025, as reported by the [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en), [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en), and The Times of Israel, he was also actively engaged in diplomatic efforts around the same time, as reported by the [Ethiopian News Agency](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848) and Fana Media Corporation. This suggests that the removal from the conference did not constitute a full expulsion.
