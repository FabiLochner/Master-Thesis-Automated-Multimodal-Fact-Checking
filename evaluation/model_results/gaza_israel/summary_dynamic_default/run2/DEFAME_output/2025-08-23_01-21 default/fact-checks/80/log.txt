Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas, and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir. <image:5616>, <image:5618>. The article mentions the handover of the bodies by Hamas and the grief of Israelis.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article on September 5, 2024, about a protest in Tel Aviv. The protesters carried 27 mock coffins to represent hostages killed in Gaza. <image:49> is included in the article.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on September 5, 2024, reports on a protest in Tel Aviv where demonstrators carried makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. <image:49> The protesters are angry with the Israeli government.

The claim '<image:49> This image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, as reported by [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/) and [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages). The protest was to demand the release of hostages held in Gaza, not to represent dead Israeli soldiers.

So, the overall veracity is: false
