### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, invited representatives of the Israeli embassy in Spain to a soccer match. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/)) and The Jerusalem Post ([https://honestlyconcerned.info/links/barcelonas-famous-soccer-team-sends-israel-a-message-of-support-fc-barcelonas-president-joan-laporta-invited-representatives-of-the-israeli-embassy-in-spain-to-their-soccer-match-against-manches/](https://honestlyconcerned.info/links/barcelonas-famous-soccer-team-sends-israel-a-message-of-support-fc-barcelonas-president-joan-laporta-invited-representatives-of-the-israeli-embassy-in-spain-to-their-soccer-match-against-manches/)) both reported on this event.

The Times of Israel article, published on February 17, 2023, also mentions the Spanish Foreign Minister's criticism of Barcelona's mayor. The Jerusalem Post article, also published on February 17, 2023, mentions the match was against Manchester United. The image ![image 52](media/83.jpg) is included in the Jerusalem Post article.


## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war. The evidence indicates that the image was taken on February 16, 2023, and published in articles in February and September 2023. The evidence also mentions the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date. The image was taken in February 2023, not September 2024. The claim is accurate regarding the presence of the President of FC Barcelona and Israel Embassy Representatives. The claim is also accurate regarding the ongoing Gaza war.


## Final Judgement
The image was taken in February 2023, not September 2024, as the claim states. The claim is accurate regarding the presence of the President of FC Barcelona and Israel Embassy Representatives. The claim is also accurate regarding the ongoing Gaza war.
