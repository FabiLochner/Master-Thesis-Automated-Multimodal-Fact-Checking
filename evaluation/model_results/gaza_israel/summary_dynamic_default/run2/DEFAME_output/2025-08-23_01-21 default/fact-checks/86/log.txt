Useful result: From [Source](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel): 
Content: The USNI News article, published on August 2, 2024, reports that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East. The move is in response to threats from Iran.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/08/26/two-us-aircraft-carriers-to-stay-in-middle-east-after-hezbollah-attack/): 
Content: The Military Times published an article on August 26, 2024, stating that two U.S. aircraft carriers will remain in the Middle East after a Hezbollah attack. The article mentions the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and the Abraham Lincoln. The U.S. is boosting its military presence in the region to avert a larger conflict between Israel and Iran. <image:5698>

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is not related to U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. Reverse image search reveals the image is associated with the Baltic Operations 2024 exercise. While the U.S. did deploy warships to the Middle East in August 2024, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks), the image does not depict this.

So, the overall veracity is: false
