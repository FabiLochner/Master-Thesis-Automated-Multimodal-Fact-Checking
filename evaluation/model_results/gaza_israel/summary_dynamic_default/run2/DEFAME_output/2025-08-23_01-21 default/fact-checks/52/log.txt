Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261): 
Content: The Anadolu Agency published an article on July 10, 2025, stating that Gaza's population has dropped by 10% since the start of the Israeli war in October 2023. The article mentions that the population was estimated at 2,226,544 in 2023 and has decreased to approximately 2,114,301. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip): 
Content: The Gaza Strip has an annual population growth rate of 1.99% (2023 est.). The article mentions that the Gaza Strip's population mostly comprised Palestinians and refugees as of 2010. The Gaza Strip is 41 kilometers (25 miles) long, from 6 to 12 km (3.7 to 7.5 mi) wide, and has a total area of 365 km2 (141 sq mi). The article also mentions that the Gaza war has caused mass population displacement. <image:i>, <image:j>.

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is not supported by the evidence. While one source ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) supports the claim, other sources, including CNN and the Anadolu Agency, report a decrease in population ([https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl), [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
