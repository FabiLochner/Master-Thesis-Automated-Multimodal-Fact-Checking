Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd): 
Content: CNN published an article on October 14, 2024, discussing a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base. The article mentions that the attack occurred on a Sunday, and the IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, visited the base. <image:1> The article does not mention that Herzi Halevi was assassinated.

The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on an IDF base on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, the IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi visited the site the following day, contradicting the claim that he was assassinated. The provided sources, including [The Long War Journal](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2024/10/hezbollah-drone-strikes-idf-base-as-israel-uncovers-weapons-in-lebanon.php), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd), do not support the assassination claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
