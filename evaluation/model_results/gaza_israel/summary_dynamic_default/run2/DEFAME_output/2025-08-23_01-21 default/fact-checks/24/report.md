## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The DW article fact-checks the claim that UNRWA is mourning the death of Yahya Sinwar, stating that the black ribbon on the UNRWA logo has been present since at least October 22, 2023, to show solidarity with the victims of war. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) refuted claims that an agency staff member was killed alongside Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip. The Wikipedia article discusses the killing of Yahya Sinwar by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on October 16, 2024, during the Gaza war. ![image 18](media/24.jpg)

The article mentions that UNRWA teacher's passport was found on Sinwar's body.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the black band on the UNRWA logo is not related to mourning the death of Yahya Sinwar. It has been present since at least October 22, 2023, to show solidarity with war victims. The claim is therefore not supported by the evidence.

The evidence also mentions that an UNRWA teacher's passport was found on Sinwar's body.


## Final Judgement
The claim that UNRWA placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar is false. The black ribbon was present before Sinwar's death and is related to showing solidarity with war victims.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The black band on the UNRWA logo, as seen in the provided image, was present before the death of Yahya Sinwar and is used to show solidarity with war victims, not to mourn Sinwar.
