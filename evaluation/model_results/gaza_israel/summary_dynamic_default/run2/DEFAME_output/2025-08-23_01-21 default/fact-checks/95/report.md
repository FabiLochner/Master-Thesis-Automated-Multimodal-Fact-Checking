### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss Israeli attacks in Gaza during July 2024. One source, a Wikipedia article, details the July 13, 2024, al-Mawasi attack, which resulted in at least 90 Palestinian deaths and over 300 injuries, and mentions the EU calling for an independent investigation, considering the attack a possible war crime. Another source, an NPR article, reports on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on July 13, 2024, that killed 90 Palestinians, targeting the head of the Hamas military wing, Mohammed Deif. A CNN article reports on an Israeli attack on an UNRWA school in Gaza on July 6, 2024, which killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured 50 others.

The sources mention the Gaza war and Israeli airstrikes. The image ![image 62](media/95.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, in February 2023. The web search confirms that there were Israeli attacks in Gaza in July 2024, but the image is unrelated to those events.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a man in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in February 2023, not a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, in February 2023, as confirmed by sources like [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html), [SBS News](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl). The claim incorrectly associates the image with events in Gaza in July 2024.
