### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023. The article mentions a study by Amnesty International and is based on growth forecasts from August 2023. ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) ![image 5345](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755912986-930770.jpg)

CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reported that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 were killed in Israeli attacks.

A Times of Israel article claims a 6% decrease in population since the war began.

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published by the Anadolu Agency on July 10, 2025, Gaza's population has decreased by 10% since the start of the Israeli war in October 2023, with the population dropping from an estimated 2,226,544 in 2023 to approximately 2,114,301.

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, an article by the New York City Financial Policy Association, claims a 2.02% increase, referencing a study by Amnesty International and growth forecasts from August 2023. However, other sources, such as CNN and the Anadolu Agency, report a decrease in population, with the Anadolu Agency stating a 10% decrease. Skeptics.stackexchange.com also mentions a 2.02% increase and a 2.88% annual change, while The Times of Israel claims a 6% decrease.

The conflicting data makes it difficult to verify the claim. The claim is supported by one source, but contradicted by multiple other sources. The claim's veracity is uncertain due to the conflicting information.


## Final Judgement
The claim is contradicted by multiple sources that report a decrease in population, while the source supporting the claim is based on growth forecasts from before the conflict. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is not supported by the evidence. While one source ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) supports the claim, other sources, including CNN and the Anadolu Agency, report a decrease in population ([https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl), [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261)).
