Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/30/israel-attacks-live-blog-lebanon-yemen-hamas-hezbollah-news-updates-middle-east-crisis): 
Content: The Guardian's live blog, updated on October 1, 2024, discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, with events from September 30, 2024. Key events include:

*   An Israeli "targeted ground operation" in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah.
*   Israeli airstrikes hitting Beirut's southern suburbs.
*   Reports of rocket attacks, including one near Baghdad International Airport, which a US defense official disputed, stating that US forces were not targeted.
*   The US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, about dismantling attack infrastructure along the border with Lebanon.
*   A US state department spokesperson said Israel informed the US about "limited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border."
*   The article mentions the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
*   The article also mentions the UKMTO receiving a report of an incident 64 nautical miles northwest of Yemen’s Hodeidah.

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not fully verifiable. While there were rocket attacks near Baghdad International Airport targeting a U.S. facility on September 30, 2024, as reported by [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-09-30/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-in-baghdad-military-sources-say) and mentioned in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/30/israel-attacks-live-blog-lebanon-yemen-hamas-hezbollah-news-updates-middle-east-crisis), the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
