The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there are documented instances of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image provided appears to be digitally altered and cannot be verified as authentic. Reverse image searches and other searches did not yield any results to confirm the image's authenticity or the details provided in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
