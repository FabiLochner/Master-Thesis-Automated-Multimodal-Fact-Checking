Useful result: From [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/): 
Content: The Atlantic Council published an article on March 18, 2025, discussing the US approach toward the Houthis. The article mentions that on March 15, 2025, Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. The article also mentions that Russia has aided Houthi operations. <image:635>, <image:637>, <image:638>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that the Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are the first since late 2024, after Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes. The article mentions that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis includes a timeline of events, including Houthi attacks on commercial vessels and military operations. It mentions Operation Prosperity Guardian, a US-led coalition, and a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire. The article also mentions a statement by Yahya Saree that they would target ships heading to Israeli ports in the Mediterranean Sea. On May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council and ABC News, along with a Wikipedia article, indicates that the Houthis continued military operations in international waters after Trump's election, including attacks on ships and U.S. airstrikes in response.

So, the overall veracity is: false
