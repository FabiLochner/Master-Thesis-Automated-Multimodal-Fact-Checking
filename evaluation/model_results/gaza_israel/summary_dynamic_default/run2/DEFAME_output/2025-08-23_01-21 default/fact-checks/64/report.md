## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A fact-check by AOL on April 7, 2025, debunked the claim that Iranian General Esmail Qaani fled to Israel, stating that no media outlets reported it and the Israel Defense Forces did not confirm it. The article mentions Qaani was seen at rallies in February 2025 (![image 5457](media/2025-08-23_01-42-1755913356-232280.jpg)). The Jerusalem Post reported on June 30, 2025, about a post from the X account @MossadSpokesman denying rumors of ties to Esmail Qaani (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

The Times of Israel reported that Esmail Qaani was killed in an Israeli attack, citing unnamed Iranian sources (![image 5483](media/2025-08-23_01-42-1755913373-573154.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. A fact-check by AOL on April 7, 2025, debunked the claim, stating that no media outlets reported it and the Israel Defense Forces did not confirm it. The evidence also includes a report from The Times of Israel that Esmail Qaani was killed in an Israeli attack.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including a fact-check by AOL, deny the claim. Furthermore, there are reports of Qaani's death in an Israeli attack.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A fact-check by AOL on April 7, 2025, debunked the claim, and The Times of Israel reported that Esmail Qaani was killed in an Israeli attack.
