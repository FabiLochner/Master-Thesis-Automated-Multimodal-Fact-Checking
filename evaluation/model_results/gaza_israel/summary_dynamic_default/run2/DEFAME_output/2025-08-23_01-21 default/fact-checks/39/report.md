The claim is false. The image is from Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics.

The claim is demonstrably false. The image is from Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics. The colors in the image are similar to the Palestinian flag, but the image does not show China’s Olympic uniform.
