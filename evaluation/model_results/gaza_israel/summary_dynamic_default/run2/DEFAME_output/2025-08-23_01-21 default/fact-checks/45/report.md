Ynetnews ([https://www.ynetnews.com/environment/article/s1n8qjyt1x](https://www.ynetnews.com/environment/article/s1n8qjyt1x)) published an article discussing Thunberg's shift from climate activism to anti-Israel activism. ![image 29](media/45.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html)) report that Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Germany" and "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)) also reported on the incident.

The New York Post and Yahoo News included images of Thunberg at the rally, including one where she is laughing (![image 396](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846195-195779.jpg)). The Telegraph also included a photo of Thunberg at the event (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg did express the phrase "Fuck Israel" at a rally. The reverse image search confirms the existence of the image in the claim. The web search results provide additional context, indicating that the incident occurred at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. The New York Post, Yahoo News, and The Telegraph all reported on the event.

The claim is partially accurate. While the image is authentic, the claim does not specify the context of the image. The evidence suggests that the image is related to an event in Germany, not necessarily from November 2024.

The claim is partially verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg did express the phrase "Fuck Israel" at a rally. The reverse image search confirms the existence of the image in the claim. The web search results provide additional context, indicating that the incident occurred at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. The claim is partially accurate, as the image is authentic, but the context of the image is not fully specified.
