The Mirror published an article on October 9, 2024, stating that an earthquake struck Iran on October 5, 2024, and was also reported in Israel. The Economic Times also published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing the earthquake in Iran on October 5, 2024, and mentioning escalating military tensions between Israel and Iran-backed groups, as well as Hezbollah's rocket strikes into Israel on October 8, 2024. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) detected two earthquakes in northern Iran on October 5, 2024. ![image 5581](media/2025-08-23_01-46-1755913598-737506.jpg), ![image 5585](media/2025-08-23_01-46-1755913604-040533.jpg), ![image 5586](media/2025-08-23_01-46-1755913604-589603.jpg), ![image 5587](media/2025-08-23_01-46-1755913613-145342.jpg), ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg), ![image 4](media/3.jpg), ![image 5](media/4.jpg).
