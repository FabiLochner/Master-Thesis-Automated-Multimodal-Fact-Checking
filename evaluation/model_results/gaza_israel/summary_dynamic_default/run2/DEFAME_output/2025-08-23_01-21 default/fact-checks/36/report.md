## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article discussing Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and his statements regarding a strike on Iran, mentioning an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, as a reprisal for Israel’s killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The article also mentions that Netanyahu was not present at the time of the attack. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/strike-on-iran-will-make-world-understand-israels-might-says-defence-minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/strike-on-iran-will-make-world-understand-israels-might-says-defence-minister)) ![image 5065](media/2025-08-23_01-30-1755912607-421634.jpg)

The Times of Israel reported on an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stating the attack "didn't even scratch" the Israeli Air Force's capabilities. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) ![image 5068](media/2025-08-23_01-30-1755912612-589723.jpg), ![image 5069](media/2025-08-23_01-30-1755912613-696654.jpg) Iran International discussed the Iranian missile attack, a phone call between US President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the cancellation of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's visit to Washington DC.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, was alive after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. He made statements about the attack and its impact on the Israeli Air Force. Furthermore, the evidence mentions the cancellation of Gallant's visit to Washington D.C. after the attack, which would not have been possible if he had been killed.

The claim that Gallant was killed in the attack is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence from multiple sources confirms that Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, was alive and active after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. He made statements about the attack, and his activities were reported after the event. This contradicts the claim that he was killed in the attack.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/strike-on-iran-will-make-world-understand-israels-might-says-defence-minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/strike-on-iran-will-make-world-understand-israels-might-says-defence-minister)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)), shows that Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, was alive and active after the alleged attack, making statements and having his activities reported.
