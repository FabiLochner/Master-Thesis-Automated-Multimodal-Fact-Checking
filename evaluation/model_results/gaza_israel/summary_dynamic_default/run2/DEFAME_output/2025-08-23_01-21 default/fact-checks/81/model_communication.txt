The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and includes memorial plaques. The cenotaph is made of granite, bronze, and aluminum. The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)), Memorial Mapping ([http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza)), and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)). <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial includes a sculpture and a remnant from the Twin Towers. The evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to search for other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, is described in the search results. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, includes a 30-foot high bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame, resting on a granite base, and a metal remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial was dedicated on November 12, 2009, and commemorates the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and includes memorial plaques. The cenotaph is made of granite, bronze, and aluminum. The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)), Memorial Mapping ([http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza)), and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)). <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial includes a sculpture and a remnant from the Twin Towers. The evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to search for other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

    Tribute in Light, New York City
    -------------------------------
    
    The Municipal Art Society of New York and Creative Time’s installation of 88 searchlights—conceived by John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian Laverdiere, and Paul Myoda with lighting consultant Paul Marantz—initially ran from March 11 through April 14, 2002, to mark the six-month anniversary of the attacks. “Obviously the deceased are not going to experience any of this but it needs to carry your memories of them.”

Following the tragic events on September 11, 2001, many cities, both in the US and abroad, built memorials for the victims, survivors, and first responders."

The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, includes a 30-foot high bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame, resting on a granite base, and a metal remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial was dedicated on November 12, 2009, and commemorates the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and includes memorial plaques. The cenotaph is made of granite, bronze, and aluminum. The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)), Memorial Mapping ([http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza)), and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)). <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial includes a sculpture and a remnant from the Twin Towers. The evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to search for other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:53>)
reverse_search(<image:53>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. It was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and is attributed to the Kan public broadcaster. The image was also featured in a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019.

The Times of Israel website also has articles related to the Prime Minister's Residence, discussing events from 2023, 2024, and 2025. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow" by Robert Lindsay.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken before August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The claim states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken before August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, and it was taken before August 2024. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. It was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and is attributed to the Kan public broadcaster. The image was also featured in a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019.

The Times of Israel website also has articles related to the Prime Minister's Residence, discussing events from 2023, 2024, and 2025. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow" by Robert Lindsay.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken before August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, and it was taken before August 2024. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, as evidenced by its appearance in a June 2020 Times of Israel article and a July 2019 YouTube video. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is false, as the image predates this timeframe.

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

 on August 11.

The image appeared to show a news presenter from Israel’s Channel 12 standing next to a poll graphic with a Hebrew-language question that translates as: “Do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a “terrorist”?”

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:5666>](https://komonews.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X."

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?” 

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that “they should stand criminal trial”; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn’t know.  

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B’tselem in their report “[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.” High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. There is almost nothing they can do to Palestinians that the Jewish Israeli public would consider criminal, and hardly any Israelis would consider them “human animals” for thinking like that. 

_Correction: The story originally incorrectly said that “28% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‘they should stand criminal trial.'” The correct percentage is 21%. The story has been updated._

Quds Force chief Esmail Qaani.

**By Our Correspondent**

**NEW DELHI –** Iran’s top commander being a Mossad agent as propagated through international media, including the mainstream Indian media, has subsided after the public appearance of Esmail Qaani.

The Iranian Embassy in India has strongly refuted the assertions about Qaani being a Mossad spy and labelled them as fake news.

The Embassy said in a statement: “We strongly deny the allegation that Esmail Qaani is a Mossad agent. _**Tehran Times**_ reported that this false news was followed by “_**Iran International,**_ a Persian-language outlet linked to the Zionist regime and covertly directed by Manouchehr Amir, a former director of **_Radio Israel_**.” Iran International cited an “informed source” claiming that Commander Qaani’s family also had no news regarding his whereabouts or what he was doing.

The disappearance of Esmail Qaani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) elite Quds Force, had given a new twist to the ongoing aggression of Israel against Palestine and Lebanon amid widespread speculations that he was a Mossad spy involved in the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Embassy said in a statement: “We strongly deny the allegation that Esmail Qaani is a Mossad agent. Iranian authorities have maintained that these allegations are part of a disinformation campaign to destabilize the region and tarnish the reputation of its military leadership.

In the age of visionless and negative journalism, IndiaTomorrow.net will highlight stories of hope and development. Such claims are baseless and lack any credibility.” The Embassy also highlighted that the IRGC has officially announced that Qaani is set to receive the highest military honour from Ayatollah Khamenei, dispelling rumours about any investigations or accusations against him.

Meanwhile, the **_Tehran Times_** closely linked with the Iranian government reported that Eamail Qaani was the target of a Zionist disinformation campaign amid rising regional tensions.

The false news story about Commander Qaani’s disappearance was first reported by the **_Reuters_** news agency which, the _**Tehran Times**_ claims, is known for a history of false reporting about Iran. It was followed by a story filed by the Qatari-funded **_Middle East Eye_** claiming through its independent sources that Qaani was under house arrest and was being interrogated by the Islamic Republic’s intelligence sleuths. Mossad has been given credit for Israel’s operations in which the war on Gaza has been extended beyond its borders.

Qaani, 67, who travelled to Lebanon after Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month, was not heard for several days. Initial reports suggested that Qaani was under house arrest and was being interrogated on suspicion of being an Israeli spy.

Qaani was appointed as the head of the Quds Force after Qassem Soleimani’s assassination by the U.S. While Soleimani commanded significant respect and maintained close ties with Iran’s regional allies, Qaani has not been able to match that level of influence or authority, as noted by military analysts and those familiar with both men.

Under Qaani’s leadership, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah and Iraqi militias have faced increased pressure, particularly from Israeli forces, contrasting with the expansion of their influence under Soleimani. Qaani was born in Iran’s Mashhad town and had fought in the Iran-Iraq war."

Afghan Officials: Iran’s New Quds Chief Likely Faked Identity in 2018

Print

Afghan officials say they are investigating a visit in 2018 of the new commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, to the province of Bamiyan where he claimed to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul.

Qaani, a 61-year-old brigadier general, became the chief of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), following the U.S. Esmail Qaani was in charge of QF operations in Central Asia while \[Soleimani\] himself was busy fighting the Americans, Israel and IS in Iraq, Lebanon and Levant.”

According to Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, Iran since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 has recruited thousands of Afghans into what is known as the Fatemiyoun battalion. killing of Qassem Soleimani Friday in an airstrike.

Shortly after his appointment, Afghan media circulated pictures showing him paying an official visit to Bamiyan province in July 2018, allegedly as Iran’s deputy ambassador.

The governor of Bamiyan, Mohammad Tahir Zuhair, who appeared in one of the photos giving Qaani a local tapestry, told VOA that Qaani introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat visiting the province to reiterate Iran’s support for the local government.

“Let me emphasize again that no foreign delegation ever comes to this province without Kabul coordinating the visit. We were told by Kabul that an Iranian delegation would oversee the process of building a hospital in Bamiyan,” Zuhair told VOA.

The governor said officials in Kabul instructed the local government to provide Qaani and his team with security and logistics assistance.

“The Iranian delegation spent about 45 minutes in the hospital and then came to my office and we met. He said that they came to Bamiyan to tell the people that Iran liked to help them,” he told VOA.

At the time of his visit to Bamiyan, Qaani was serving as the deputy commander of the Quds Force under Soleimani.

**Why the visit?**

Afghan officials say that Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan, raising questions about the intentions of his visit to the predominately Shiite province in central Afghanistan.

“We are investigating the exact nature and date of his visit. At this point I can assure you that he was never the deputy ambassador in Afghanistan,” Idrees Zaman, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister, said in a press conference Tuesday.

Some Afghanistan analysts like Jonathan Schroden, the director of Center for Stability and Development at Washington-based research and analysis organization CNA, are charging that Iran might have arranged for the alleged disguise to prevent the Afghan government’s monitoring.

“It is hard to say whether he was actually traveling under a false title in this case; it’s possible that Iran could have named him as a DCM, if even temporarily, in whatever travel documents he had, etc., in order to provide him official cover for his travel,” Schroden said.

He however expressed some skepticism over the alleged disguise, saying it is unlikely that Iran’s commander could hide behind a bogus identity given his high-profile status for years in Iran and the wider region.

**Recruitment**

Other experts say Qaani’s visit could be seen as an effort to mobilize Shiite people to support the Quds Force, given Iran’s previous efforts to gain influence among Shiites in Afghanistan.

Regional experts say it was Qaani’s duty to actively recruit for the Quds Force among Shia populations in Afghanistan.

Farzin Nadimi, an associate fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VOA that one of Iran’s main targets has been to establish a foothold in the Shiite areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He added that it is generally believed that “his \[Soleimani\] deputy, Gen."

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is associated with rumors about Esmail Qaani disguising himself, possibly in a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. The reverse image search confirms the image's presence in discussions about Qaani's alleged disguise. The India Tomorrow article mentions rumors about Qaani, and Getty Images has images of Qaani and veiled women. The Nairaland forum post links to an article discussing Qaani's disguise.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image as Qaani in disguise. However, it does show that the image is used in discussions and articles that suggest this possibility.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is indeed Esmail Qaani and whether the disguise was intentional.

Iran general’s whereabouts in question after Israeli strikes on Hezbollah
=========================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

[Patrick Wintour](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour)
 Diplomatic editor

Conflicting reports include house arrest of Esmail Ghaani, who was in Beirut at time of Hassan Nasrallah’s killing

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/middle-east-crisis-live-eu-israel-iran-lebanon-blog-news-updates-hezbollah-hamas-unifil)
    

Mystery surrounded the whereabouts and health of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander Esmail Ghaani, amid reports that he was being investigated over how Israel managed to penetrate and crush the command structure of [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
, the Lebanese militia at the heart of the Iranian “axis of resistance”.

It is known that Ghaani, who leads the IRGC’s al-Quds force, was in Beirut at the time of the killing of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, but Iranian authorities have insisted he is alive, and even in line for an award for valour.

The Middle East Eye news outlet claimed Ghaani had been put under house arrest and was being investigated over the failures that allowed [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 to penetrate the Hezbollah network so effectively.

Over the past two months, Israel has killed several Hezbollah leaders and appears to have made a leap forward in the quality of its intelligence.

Another Arabic outlet claimed Ghaani had suffered a heart attack during questioning.

Israeli sources said the reports, regardless of their veracity, showed the degree of stress inside the IRGC over the destruction of the Hezbollah leadership in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

One source said: “This has been a mind-blowing success as a result of a decade of intelligence gathering. “Iran is not the only one that does not want a large-scale war, but everyone knows how disastrous this war is.”

Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the royal court in Riyadh, said: “The Iranians have stated: ‘If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war.’”

!Esmail Ghaani in military uniform <image:5745>

Ghaani was appointed commander of al-Quds, a branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in 2020. On Tuesday, Iraj Masjedi, the deputy commander of al-Quds and a former Iranian ambassador to Baghdad, told reporters that Ghaani was “in good health and is carrying out his daily duties”.

Western diplomats said it was possible that Israel was considering a campaign of assassinations of the Iranian leadership as the most escalatory end of the range of options to be used in its imminent response to Tehran’s attack last week.

The diplomats believe Joe Biden came away from a conversation on Wednesday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, still unclear how and when Israel would respond. “He has the whiff of cordite in his nostrils” said one source, of Netanyahu, adding that there was little obvious leverage to restrain him.

[UN peacekeepers in Lebanon say Israel has fired on their bases deliberately\

The three other options are a strike on Iranian military targets of an order similar to the Israeli strike in April; an attack on economic infrastructure, including oil facilities; or an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.

The US has strongly advised Israel not to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, and it has been made clear that neither the US or the UK would provide the practical help probably needed to undertake such an attack. Israeli officials have also been advised that it would be unwise to start its response at the top end of the escalatory scale.

Western diplomats believe the Israeli strikes could start as early as next week, but others calculate that the more Netanyahu delays until closer to the US presidential election on 5 November, the more leverage Netanyahu will have over the Democrats to support any decision he takes. Senior former Israeli intelligence officials argue that an attack on Iranian oil infrastructure would work, and not lead to a big escalation in oil prices."

Iranian commander Esmail Qaani on Tuesday appeared in public after weeks of absence to attend the funeral ceremony for general [Abbas Nilforoushan](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-iraq-funerals-irgc-general-killed-hezbollah-chief)
, who was killed last month in [Lebanon](https://www.newarab.com/news/unifil-stay-all-lebanon-positions-despite-israel-threats)
.

Nilforoushan, a general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed in an [Israeli](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-says-iran-attack-caused-costliest-damage-7-october)
 strike on Beirut alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.

The funeral procession for the slain Iranian general began at the Imam Hossein Square in central Tehran Tuesday morning, according to a live broadcast on state television.

Qaani - who heads the Quds Force, the IRGC's foreign operations arm - had disappeared from public view and was rumoured in some media to have either been targeted in an Israeli strike on Lebanon, or be questioned under guard over Israel's killing of Nasrallah.

He appeared Tuesday at the funeral, clad in the Guards' green military uniform.

Thousands attended the funeral procession in Imam Hossein Square, many of them carrying yellow [Hezbollah](https://www.newarab.com/news/un-draft-resolution-seeks-hezbollah-disarmament-lebanon-reforms)
 banners and Iranian and Palestinian flags and chanting "Death to Israel".

[Iran's](https://www.newarab.com/news/israels-expanding-wars-pushing-iran-towards-nuclear-weapons)
 foreign ministry said Monday the Islamic republic would use "all its capacities" to bring Israel to account over the deaths.

On 1 October, Iran launched 200 missiles on Israel in retaliation for the death of Nilforoushan and Nasrallah, in its second-ever direct attack on its arch-foe.

The attack was also in retaliation for [Hamas](https://www.newarab.com/news/hamas-and-fatah-meet-egypt-unity-talks-gaza)
 chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in July while he was in Tehran to attend an inauguration ceremony for Iran's president.

Israel has vowed to retaliate for the missile attack, with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant saying Israel's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".

Iran has in recent days engaged in high-level diplomatic talks around establishing a ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza, as well as ways to prevent the conflict from spreading across the region.

On a visit to [Baghdad](https://www.newarab.com/news/rockets-hit-near-baghdad-airport-where-us-advisors-are-stationed)
, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said that Iran was "fully prepared for a war situation", but added that "we do not want war, we want peace".

In April Tehran had fired a volley of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in [Damascus](https://www.newarab.com/news/smotrich-calls-bit-bit-israeli-expansion-damascus)
, blamed on Israel.

The Voice of America ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html)) also mentions Qaani and includes a photo of him.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an article titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" from Foreign Affairs. The article, and the discussion around it, centers on the claim that Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, was disguised in civilian clothing, possibly a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. <image:57> is included in the discussion. The post links to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise. The forum discussion includes various opinions and reactions to the situation. The date of the post is June 26, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is associated with rumors about Esmail Qaani disguising himself, possibly in a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. The reverse image search confirms the image's presence in discussions about Qaani's alleged disguise. The India Tomorrow article mentions rumors about Qaani, and Getty Images has images of Qaani and veiled women. The Nairaland forum post links to an article discussing Qaani's disguise.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image as Qaani in disguise. However, it does show that the image is used in discussions and articles that suggest this possibility.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is indeed Esmail Qaani and whether the disguise was intentional.

Esmail Qaani (Photo: khamenei.ir)

The deputy commander of Iran's elite Quds Force claimed on Monday that its chief Esmail Qaani is “in good health” amid reports that he was missing in the Lebanese capital of Beirut after last week’s Israeli strike on top Hezbollah terrorist commanders who reportedly convened in a subterranean site.

“He is in good health and is carrying out his activities. Some ask us to issue a statement… there is no need for this,” Quds Force Deputy Commander Iraj Masjedi stated regarding Qaani.

The main target of the Israeli strike was Hashem Safi al-Din, a top Hezbollah official and supposedly the candidate to replace Hezbollah Sec.-Gen. It is also unclear whether Qaani attended the meeting with top Hezbollah terrorists.

A New York Times report claimed last week that Qaani was killed in the Israeli strike. On Sunday, Britain's Daily Mail reported that Qaani was “believed to have been killed.”

An unnamed Iranian official told Reuters that Qaani visited the Dahiyeh district, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Lebanon but insisted that he did not meet Safi al-Din.

Sky News Arabia reported Lebanese sources claiming there had been no contact with Qaani since the Israeli aerial strike.

The Quds Force is a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and is a designated terrorist organization by the United States, Israel and other governments. The Quds Force has been instrumental in arming and training Tehran-loyal militants in Syria and Iraq.

Qaani became the head of the Quds Force after the United States eliminated his predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq in January 2020.

If Qaani, indeed, perished in the Israeli strike, he would be the highest-ranking Iranian official to have been eliminated by Israel Defense Forces. Abbas Nilforushan**](https://apnews.com/article/iran-revolutionary-guard-general-dead-hezbollah-israel-airstrike-46d2133e594b9c4ce448a6b683802995)
, who was killed alongside Nasrallah last month.

The article from India Tomorrow ([Source](https://indiatomorrow.net/2024/10/17/irans-top-commander-being-mossad-agent-subsides-after-his-public-appearance-the-iran-embassy-in-india-denies-the-rumours-about-esmail-qaani/)) discusses rumors about Esmail Qaani, including a photo of him. The Voice of America ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html)) also mentions Qaani and includes a photo of him.

From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an article titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" from Foreign Affairs. The article, and the discussion around it, centers on the claim that Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, was disguised in civilian clothing, possibly a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. <image:57> is included in the discussion. The post links to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise. The forum discussion includes various opinions and reactions to the situation. The date of the post is June 26, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is associated with rumors about Esmail Qaani disguising himself, possibly in a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. The reverse image search confirms the image's presence in discussions about Qaani's alleged disguise. The India Tomorrow article mentions rumors about Qaani, and Getty Images has images of Qaani and veiled women. The Nairaland forum post links to an article discussing Qaani's disguise.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image as Qaani in disguise. However, it does show that the image is used in discussions and articles that suggest this possibility.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is indeed Esmail Qaani and whether the disguise was intentional.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

TEL AVIV — Powerful Israeli airstrikes killed 90 Palestinians and wounded 300 Saturday in southern Gaza, officials said. Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said he authorized the strike against the head of the Hamas military wing, [Mohammed Deif,](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205448988/hamas-military-mohammed-deif-gaza-israel)
 but acknowledged the fate of the militant leader was not immediately clear.

The Israelis bombed the city of Khan Younis and the nearby costal area of al-Muwasi, which has been designated a humanitarian safe zone by the Israeli military. This was the latest — and one of the deadliest — in a series of ongoing Israeli air operations directed at Hamas, but which have also inflicted heavy civilian casualties.

[!What to know about the elusive Hamas military commander behind the attack on Israel <image:5799>](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205448988/hamas-military-mohammed-deif-gaza-israel)

### [What to know about the elusive Hamas military commander behind the attack on Israel](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205448988/hamas-military-mohammed-deif-gaza-israel)

Shortly after the strike, reports began circulating that the attack was aimed at Deif, a shadowy figure who has led the military arm of Hamas for more than two decades and has survived multiple Israeli attempts to kill him.

In a briefing, an Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attack targeted Deif, as well as another senior Hamas commander, Rafah Salameh. He did not provide additional details.

Hamas said in a statement that Israel was making "false claims merely to cover up the extent of the horrific massacre." The statement did not mention Deif.

The two top Hamas figures in Gaza are [Yahya Sinwar](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/27/1215477151/who-is-yahya-sinwar)
, the group's political leader in the territory, and Deif, who runs the military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades.

Israel says these are the two Hamas leaders most responsible for orchestrating the Oct. His wife and two of the couple's small children were killed in a 2014 airstrike intended for Deif in Gaza.

His nom de guerre "Deif" means "[guest](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57253521)
" in Arabic, referring to the widely held belief that he never stays in one place for long, always changing locations in an attempt to stay a step ahead of the Israelis.

!People search the rubble of a collapsed building in the aftermath of an Israeli attack at UNRWA’s Al-Jaouni school in al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on July 6. A senior Hamas official told CNN the militant group was ready to reconsider its insistence that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages.

CNN  — 

An [Israeli](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel)
 attack has killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured 50 others at UNRWA’s Al-Jaouni school sheltering displaced people in al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday.

CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers.

A displaced man at the school told CNN children were among the injured.

“There was a swing here, swings were here, (children) were playing. “We barely found this place in the school, but even the school is not safe.”

CNN video shows several injured children arriving at a nearby hospital following the attack.

The Israeli military said in a statement on Saturday militants were operating in structures located in the school area.

“This location served as a hideout and operational infrastructure from which attacks against IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops operating in the Gaza Strip were directed and carried out,” the statement added.

CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military’s claim.

UNRWA Communication Director Juliette Touma told CNN UNRWA does not have all the information yet, adding that half of UNRWA’s facilities in Gaza have been hit since October 7.

“At least 500 people sheltering in those (UNRWA) facilities have been killed, many were women and children,” she added.

The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said it “condemned in the strongest terms” the attack on the UNRWA building, which it said “houses thousands of displaced civilians.”

Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the strike and what it called Israel’s “clear disregard for the rules of international law,” saying that humanitarian facilities and shelters must be protected under international law.

The news comes just as it appeared some progress was being made in long-stalled hostage release and truce negotiations. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv’s Democracy Square to call for new elections and the release of hostages amid discontent with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handled issues including the war in Gaza.

Israeli police said in a statement that two protesters were arrested at the Tel Aviv demonstration, citing violations of public order and unsafe behavior, including “lighting bonfires on the road.”

The police said they deployed in large forces to maintain security and order and dispersed the demonstration after protesters illegally gathered on Menachem Begin Road and tried to block it, despite initial approval for the protest.

Protesters waved Israeli flags and held signs criticizing Netanyahu, while police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking the traffic on the Ayalon Highway.

“After most of the protesters dispersed naturally and in light of the violations of order by a handful of protesters, the police had to declare an illegal demonstration,” the police said.

“During the dispersal of the rioters, the police arrested two suspects.”

The Israeli police further warned that it “will act with zero tolerance towards those who disrupt the order and will not listen to the policemen’s instructions.”

The chairman of Israel’s National Unity and former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, was seen participating in a rally calling for the return of the hostages.

The often-weekly demonstrations have yet to change the political landscape, and Netanyahu still controls a stable majority in parliament.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”
