### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source, from Wikipedia, details a drone attack on July 19, 2024, that targeted an apartment building, resulting in one death and ten injuries. The Houthi movement claimed responsibility, and the drone was not intercepted due to human error. The article also includes ![image 58](media/91.jpg).

Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, which killed one man and wounded four others. The New York Times reports that Houthi militants launched a missile from Yemen that landed in Tel Aviv in December 2024. The attack set off air-raid sirens and the missile landed in a playground. The Houthis claimed the attack was to aid the Palestinian people. The Reuters article includes ![image 131](media/2025-07-18_13-28-1752845302-912611.jpg).

The reverse image search and web search confirm that the image is related to an attack on Tel Aviv. The web search indicates that the Houthi movement claimed responsibility for an attack on July 19, 2024, which aligns with the claim.
