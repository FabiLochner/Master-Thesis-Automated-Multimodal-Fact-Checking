TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`

  !A workmen measures a door in a building damaged by an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 19. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.

The drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The official described it as "human error." The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.

Given the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.

The Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone "capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. The operation has achieved its goals successfully."

  !Israeli policemen search the scene of an explosion on July 19. <image:11869>

The group warned of more such attacks.

The Israeli military official said the initial evidence suggested the drone was launched from Yemen, but Israel was investigating a range of possibilities.

The Houthis have been firing for months on commercial ships in the Red Sea, off Yemen's western coast. Houthis claim responsibility** **The deadly drone slammed into an apartment building on the Tel Aviv oceanfront just after 3 a.m. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack as part of its support for Palestinians.**

A person walks down the stairs of a building damaged by a blast in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024.

Ricardo Moraes/Reuters

Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government “cannot give security to the citizens of Israel.”

“There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,” he said.

Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are “precisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel’s policy.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country’s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join.

Houthi attacks
--------------

The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country’s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses.

The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped.

CNN  — 

Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security lapses around a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv that killed one man and injured at least 10 others on Friday.

The attack was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, in what the Iranian proxy group said was a response to Israel’s war in Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Deadly explosion
----------------

The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities.

There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission and no reports of injuries of US personnel or “locally engaged staff,” the US State Department said.

“We are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,” the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens.

Emergency crews responded to “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.

“The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. The bulk carrier sank days after an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels believed to have killed one mariner on board, authorities said early Wednesday,  June 19, the second-such ship to be sunk in the rebel campaign. The bulk carrier sank days after an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels believed to have killed one mariner on board, authorities said early Wednesday, June 19, the second-such ship to be sunk in the rebel campaign. The attack “gives momentum” to these rallies, he said.

The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq.

The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis.

In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.

A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.

An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to “human error.” It was armed with a warhead and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device’s payload.

The official didn’t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel’s aerial defense systems don’t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile.

According to an initial inquiry “no sirens were activated” during the incident, the IDF said earlier.

Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was “shocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack” and sent his condolences to the victims’ families. The war has displaced almost all of the strip’s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
web_search("Houthis attack airport July 19 2024")
geolocate(<image:60>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:60>

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.


## Actions
```
web_search("airport israel after houthi attack july 19 2024")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include information about a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source discusses a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport, which caused a temporary suspension of flights ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport)). Another source, from NPR, reports on a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and includes images of the damage (<image:11869>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The search results also mention a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly link the image to the July 19, 2024, attack or the 2025 attack. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim is missing information that directly connects the image to the aftermath of the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024.

 killed an Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv and injured several others.

The Israeli military confirmed the attack, saying in a statement that it came "in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the State of Israel in recent months."

Israel strikes Houthi targets in Yemen one day after Tel Aviv drone attack
==========================================================================

The Israeli military confirmed that it had carried out airstrikes against Houthi-linked targets in Yemen, saying it was in retaliation for some 200 drone and cruise missile attacks towards Israel from Yemen since Oct. Haaretz reported that the Israeli attack against the Houthis was approved at a special security cabinet meeting which convened earlier in the day. 

Saudi news outlet Al Hadath reported on Saturday that at least three people were killed and 15 injured in the Israeli attack, and that complexes belonging to economic institutions and the military police were targeted. 

In a post on X, Houthi spokesman Nasruddin Amer vowed that the group would continue its attacks. ](/sites/default/files/styles/article_hero_medium/public/2024-07/GS8MZiCWUAAo7FT.jpeg?h=a5ae579a&itok=xKPvE-YM)

A handout picture obtained from Yemen's Houthi Ansarullah Media Center show a huge column of fire erupting following reported strikes in the Yemeni rebel-held port city of Hodeida on July 20, 2024. The Iran-backed group has been firing missiles and drones toward Israel since the war in Gaza began last October, yet Israeli and US forces have shot down the vast majority of these.

Unnamed senior American officials told The New York Times that Israel acted on its own, and that the United States did not participate in the attack. "Yemen's position with Gaza is firm and will not change, and the Yemeni operations supporting Gaza will not stop," he wrote.

According to the Israeli military, the Houthis have launched more than 200 drones and cruise missiles at Israel since the Oct. 19](/originals/2023/10/day-13-hamas-israel-war-blog-thursday-oct-19)

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

After the video went viral on social media, the woman, Daulat Abdallah Altanana, was compared to Little Red Riding Hood and the dog to the wolf. "He dragged me from the bedroom to the door and I was injured in my hand," said the woman who also claimed to have been displaced from her home during the war.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
web_search("Houthis attack airport July 19 2024")
geolocate(<image:60>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:60>

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

SummarizeDocPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
web_search("Houthis attack airport July 19 2024")
geolocate(<image:60>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:60>

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.


## Actions
```
web_search("airport israel after houthi attack july 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include information about a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source discusses a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport, which caused a temporary suspension of flights ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport)). Another source, from NPR, reports on a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and includes images of the damage (<image:11869>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The search results also mention a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly link the image to the July 19, 2024, attack or the 2025 attack. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim is missing information that directly connects the image to the aftermath of the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israel airport security after houthi attack july 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 19, 2024, reports on a drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, which resulted in one death and injuries. The Al-Monitor article from July 20, 2024, discusses Israeli strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, which occurred a day after the Tel Aviv drone attack. The articles include images of the damage (<image:11874>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the search results do not provide any information about airport security or people fleeing the airport after the attack. The image's context remains unverified.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a crowd of people in an airport, and the claim asserts that it depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on that date, the evidence does not confirm that the image is related to the attack or that people were fleeing the airport. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the provided evidence does not link the image to the attack or confirm that it depicts people fleeing the airport. The image shows a crowd of people in an airport, but there is no evidence to support the claim's assertion that it is related to the Houthi attack.
