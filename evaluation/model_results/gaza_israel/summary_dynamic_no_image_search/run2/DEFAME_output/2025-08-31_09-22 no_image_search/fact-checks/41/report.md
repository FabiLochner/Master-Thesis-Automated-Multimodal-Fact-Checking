## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Wikipedia, ICE agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil on March 8, 2025, after he attended a protest. The ACLU also reported that ICE arrested Khalil in March 2025, and his legal team stated the arrest was unconstitutional (![image 1503](media/2025-07-20_10-33-1753007600-552960.jpg)). CNN also reported that Khalil was arrested in March (<image:k>, <image:i>).

The White House posted a picture of Khalil on March 10, 2025, and Trump made a statement about Khalil on March 11. Demonstrations protesting his detention were held in New York City and Seattle, Washington.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that ICE arrested Mahmoud Khalil in March 2025. The Wikipedia article states the arrest occurred on March 8, 2025, and the ACLU and CNN also reported the arrest in March 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Khalil was a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.
