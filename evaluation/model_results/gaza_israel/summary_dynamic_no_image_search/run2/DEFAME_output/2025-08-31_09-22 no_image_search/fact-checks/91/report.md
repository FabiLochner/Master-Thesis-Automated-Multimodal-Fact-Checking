## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 58](media/91.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. One source, from LBC Group, describes an explosion in a Tel Aviv building on July 19, 2024, with bomb disposal experts on site. ([https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en))

Another source, from The Times of Israel, uses the image in a live blog about the October 7, 2023, conflict. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/)) A third source from India.com, published on October 22, 2024, uses the image in an article about Hezbollah firing rockets at Tel Aviv. ([https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/](https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/))


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source, from Wikipedia, details a drone attack on July 19, 2024, that targeted an apartment building, resulting in one death and ten injuries. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack. The article can be found here: [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel). ![image 58](media/91.jpg)

Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, killing one man and wounding four others. The article includes a photograph of a damaged building. The article can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/). ![image 131](media/2025-07-18_13-28-1752845302-912611.jpg) The New York Times reports that Houthi militants launched a missile from Yemen that landed in Tel Aviv in December 2024, causing at least 16 injuries. The article can be found here: [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html).


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The reverse image search and web search results confirm that an attack occurred in Tel Aviv in July 2024. The web search results specifically mention a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024, which aligns with the claim. However, the image is also used in articles about other events, including the October 7, 2023, conflict and a December 2024 missile attack. Therefore, while the image is associated with an event in Tel Aviv, the claim's specific association with the July 2024 Houthi attack needs further verification to confirm the image's context.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by evidence from multiple sources, including a Wikipedia article and a Reuters report, which confirm a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024. The image is also used in articles about other events, but the claim's association with the July 2024 attack is supported by the provided sources.

`true`

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
The image depicts the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024, as confirmed by sources like a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel) and a [Reuters report](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/).
