Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5477365/israel-gaza-aid-casualties): 
Content: The NPR article, published on July 23, 2025, reports that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since May while trying to get food in Gaza, mostly near aid sites. The article also mentions that Israeli strikes killed 25 people across Gaza on Tuesday. The article includes an image of Palestinians mourning their relatives killed from an Israeli army bombardment of Gaza. <image:11697> <image:11699> <image:11700>

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. While the evidence confirms Israeli bombardments in Deir al-Balah in March 2025 and resulting casualties, the exact number of Palestinian deaths in March 2025 is not specified. Therefore, the claim that at least four Palestinians were killed cannot be fully verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
