## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports on a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport on October 1, 2024, targeting a military base hosting U.S. troops, amid rising tensions in the Middle East ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)). ReliefWeb mentions attacks by Iran-backed militias on September 28 and October 2, 2024, against targets in Israel, and an attack on September 30 by the "Islamic Resistance in Iraq" ([https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024)).

The Wikipedia article "September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon" details the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah from September 23 to September 30, 2024, including Hezbollah firing rockets into northern Israel and the Golan Heights on September 30, 2024 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon)). The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg) is not present in the article.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the 2024 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. One source, an article from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)), details the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and the subsequent ceasefire agreement signed on November 26, 2024.

Another source, from the Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/lebanon-how-israel-hezbollah-and-regional-powers-are-shaping-its-future](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/lebanon-how-israel-hezbollah-and-regional-powers-are-shaping-its-future)), mentions heavy air strikes and a ground assault by Israel against Hezbollah targets. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an article ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/israels-victory-lebanon](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/israels-victory-lebanon)) on December 2, 2024, discussing the conflict and the ceasefire deal. The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg) is associated with the conflict.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024. There were attacks on military bases hosting U.S. troops in Baghdad around the same time. However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to a specific attack on a U.S. facility in Baghdad. The image is not present in the provided articles.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 11](media/13.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Nigeria': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Chile': 0.05, 'Ecuador': 0.03, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Taiwan': 0.03, 'Bangladesh': 0.02, 'Belgium': 0.02, 'Brazil': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was not taken in Baghdad or the Middle East. The most likely locations are in Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and Ukraine. This contradicts the claim that the image shows a U.S. facility under attack in Baghdad.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image is not related to the claimed event in Baghdad. The geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in a different location. The provided sources confirm the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and attacks in Baghdad, but do not link the image to these events.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there were attacks in Baghdad and a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024, the image provided does not depict a U.S. facility under attack in Baghdad. Geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in a different location, contradicting the claim.
