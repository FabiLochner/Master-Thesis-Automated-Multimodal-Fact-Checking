## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The Jerusalem Post reported that rumors of Halevi's death were circulating on social media. Newsweek reported that Halevi spoke at the base hit by a Hezbollah drone attack. Therefore, Halevi was not assassinated.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post and Newsweek, indicates that rumors of Herzi Halevi's death were circulating, but he was not assassinated. Newsweek reported that he spoke at the base after the attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While rumors of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death circulated on social media following a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, he was not assassinated. Newsweek reported that Halevi spoke at the base after the attack, contradicting the claim.
