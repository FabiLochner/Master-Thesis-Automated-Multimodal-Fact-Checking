Useful result: From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2023/11/25/715273/Humans-of-Gaza-Mayar-Bilal-inseparable-siblings): 
Content: The search result from Press TV, published on November 25, 2023, discusses Mayar and Bilal Hamida, who were killed in an Israeli airstrike on October 23. The article states that the siblings were killed with their mother in their home in the Gaza Strip. <image:11838> shows the two children.

Useful result: From [Source](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2023/11/18/82751/): 
Content: Palinfo.com published an article on November 18, 2023, stating that Mayar and Bilal Hamida, children of Palestine TV correspondent Nidal Hamida, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in October 2023. <image:11844>, <image:11842>.

The claim '<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including [Press TV](<image:11838>), indicates that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in October 2023, not July 6, 2024, as stated in the claim. Additionally, the claim incorrectly states the location of their death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
