Useful result: From [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/israel-strikes-houthi-targets-yemen-one-day-after-tel-aviv-drone-attack): 
Content: The article from Al-Monitor, published on July 20, 2024, discusses the Israeli military's strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, which occurred a day after a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv. The article mentions that the drone attack on Tel Aviv resulted in casualties. The article also includes an image of a column of fire in Hodeida, Yemen, following reported strikes. <image:11887>, <image:11889>, <image:11890>, <image:11891>

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the provided evidence does not link the image to the attack or confirm that it depicts people fleeing the airport. The image shows a crowd of people in an airport, but there is no evidence to support the claim's assertion that it is related to the Houthi attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
