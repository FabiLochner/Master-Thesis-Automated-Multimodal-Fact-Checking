Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2024/4/30/we-didnt-expect-to-find-bones-inside-one-gaza-familys-nightmare): 
Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on April 30, 2024, discusses the story of Naifa Rizq al-Sawada, a 92-year-old woman who went missing after an Israeli raid in Gaza in late March. The article mentions that the family found charred bone fragments, believed to be Naifa's remains, in their building. The article includes images of the aftermath of the raid and the area around al-Shifa Hospital. <image:1>, <image:2>. The article also mentions the challenges in getting information and aid to the area.

The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image is AI-generated, as reported by ABP Live. While there are reports of human remains being found in Gaza, such as the one published by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6269pd5y2ko](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6269pd5y2ko)), the image itself is not authentic.

So, the overall veracity is: false
