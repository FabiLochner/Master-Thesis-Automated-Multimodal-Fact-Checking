Content: The Suburban published an article stating that Mayor Valérie Plante was served by bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists. The signs displayed messages such as "Free Palestine" and "Escalate Now." The article mentions that Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi called attention to the signs, and a lawyer, Neil Oberman, is acting on his behalf. The letter demands an investigation, an apology, and measures to prevent the spread of hate. The article also mentions that the police are investigating the incident. <image:11379>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/plante-anti-nato-protest-1.7392719): 
Content: The CBC News article, published on November 25, 2024, discusses an anti-NATO protest in Montreal where protesters threw objects at police, set vehicles on fire, and broke windows. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the actions of the protesters. The article mentions that Montreal police have attended nearly 500 protests since the war in Gaza began. <image:13> is not mentioned in the article.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, as confirmed by reverse image search and geolocation. However, the sign was hacked, and the city considered it vandalism, as reported by CBC News ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809)) and The Globe and Mail ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/)). Therefore, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
