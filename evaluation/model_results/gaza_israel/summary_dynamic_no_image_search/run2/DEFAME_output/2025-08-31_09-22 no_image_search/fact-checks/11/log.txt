Useful result: From [Source](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20241016-could-hezbollah-s-drones-change-the-course-of-the-middle-east-conflict): 
Content: France 24 published an article on October 16, 2024, discussing a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, that killed four Israeli soldiers at a military base in Binyamina, south of Haifa. <image:i>, <image:j>. The article mentions that the Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi described the attack as "difficult and painful".

The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While rumors of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death circulated on social media following a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, he was not assassinated. Newsweek reported that Halevi spoke at the base after the attack, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
