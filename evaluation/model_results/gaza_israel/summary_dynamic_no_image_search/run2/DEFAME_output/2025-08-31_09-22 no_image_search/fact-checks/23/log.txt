The claim 'The Guardian published an article with the headline: 'Gaza will rise from the ashes to become a city of the future to rival Bradford.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there are articles about Gaza and Bradford, there is no evidence that The Guardian published an article with the headline "Gaza will rise from the ashes to become a city of the future to rival Bradford." The search results show an article from The Guardian about Gaza and an article from the BBC about Bradford, but not the specific headline in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
