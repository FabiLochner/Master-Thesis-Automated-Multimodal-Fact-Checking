Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that the population of Gaza has declined by 6% since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is contradicted by multiple sources. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) and The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) report a population decrease, while the claim is based on pre-war forecasts.

So, the overall veracity is: false
