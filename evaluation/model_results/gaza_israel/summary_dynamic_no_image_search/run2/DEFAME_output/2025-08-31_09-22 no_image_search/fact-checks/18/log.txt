Content: Entertainment Weekly reports that Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony took place on March 18, 2025. <image:1>. The article mentions a viral post depicting a vandalized star, but it is unclear if the images are original or manipulated.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-03-18/gal-gadot-walk-of-fame-pro-palestine-pro-israel-protesters-snow-white): 
Content: The Los Angeles Times published an article on March 18, 2025, about Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, which was interrupted by pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters. <image:15> shows the aftermath of the vandalism. The article mentions that Gadot is the first Israeli actor to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The ceremony was delayed due to the protests.

The claim '<image:15> This image shows Gal Gadot’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame being destroyed in March 2025 just hours after being placed.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts vandalism on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and Gal Gadot received her star on March 18, 2025, with the ceremony disrupted by protests, as reported by [CBS News Los Angeles](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/gal-gadots-hollywood-walk-of-fame-ceremony-disrupted-by-protest/), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/fact-check-was-gal-gadot-s-hollywood-star-destroyed-11700747?srsltid=AfmBOoo7g3WwUP2f7uer9W65UCkaRrRDmIl8avola9pgneNK7JO8TGsJ), and [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-03-18/gal-gadot-walk-of-fame-pro-palestine-pro-israel-protesters-snow-white). However, the claim that the star was destroyed hours after being placed is not explicitly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
