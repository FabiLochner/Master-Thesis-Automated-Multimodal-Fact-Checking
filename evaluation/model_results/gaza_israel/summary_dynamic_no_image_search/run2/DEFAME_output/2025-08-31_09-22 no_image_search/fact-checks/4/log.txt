Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/12/photos-israel-is-bombing-starving-palestinians-in-southern-gaza): 
Content: The search result from Al Jazeera, published on December 12, 2023, features images from Anadolu Agency and other sources, documenting Israeli attacks on Gaza. The images show the aftermath of bombings, search and rescue operations, injured Palestinians, and the destruction of buildings. <image:k> <image:11239> <image:11240> <image:11241> <image:11242> <image:11243> <image:11244> <image:11245> The article also mentions the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, including hunger and lack of essential resources.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the U.S. did conduct airstrikes on Yemen on December 22, 2024, the image's origin and its direct relation to the events described in the claim are not confirmed. The image is credited to Anadolu Agency, which has covered conflicts between Israel and Yemen, but the search results do not provide any information about the specific image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
