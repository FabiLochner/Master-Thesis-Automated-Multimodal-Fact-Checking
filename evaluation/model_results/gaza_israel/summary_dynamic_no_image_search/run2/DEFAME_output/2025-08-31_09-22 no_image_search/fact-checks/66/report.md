## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition. The BBC published articles on September 26, 2024, mentioning Zelenskyy's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) on September 23, 2024, where he signed ammunition. The Associated Press reported that Zelenskyy visited a Pennsylvania ammunition factory on September 22, 2024, and signed military ordnance. The articles can be found here: [Source](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o), [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o), and [Source](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09).

The image (![image 40](media/66.jpg)) was taken during Zelenskyy's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) on September 23, 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to [Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy), the video and images were falsely claimed to be Israeli bombs for use in Gaza. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs.

Zelenskyy wrote "Glory to Ukraine" on the shells. ![image 40](media/66.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania in September 2024, not Israeli bombs. The ammunition was intended for Ukraine's defense, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. ammunition plant in September 2024, not Israeli bombs. The claim that the image depicts Zelenskyy signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is demonstrably false.

`false`
