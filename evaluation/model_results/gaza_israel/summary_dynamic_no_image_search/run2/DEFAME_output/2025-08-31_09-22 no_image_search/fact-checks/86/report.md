USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and mentions the presence of a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group in the Eastern Mediterranean (![image 8999](media/2025-08-30_00-22-1756513333-073992.jpg)). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship (![image 9009](media/2025-08-30_00-22-1756513354-558851.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The image (![image 55](media/86.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image provided shows the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, in June 2024, not en route to Lebanon. While there is evidence of increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East in August and September 2024, the image is unrelated to the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image provided in the claim is of the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, in June 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24, and is unrelated to the claim of U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024. While there is evidence of increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East in August and September 2024, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks), [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel), and [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html), the image does not support the claim.
