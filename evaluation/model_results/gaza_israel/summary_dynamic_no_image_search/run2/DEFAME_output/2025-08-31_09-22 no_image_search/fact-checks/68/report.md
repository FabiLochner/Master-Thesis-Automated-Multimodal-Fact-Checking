### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli airstrikes in southern Syria and near Damascus in February 2025. According to Wikipedia, the strikes were part of an ongoing Israeli invasion that began in December 2024, with deeper incursions on February 25, 2025, including airstrikes in Damascus ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

Al Jazeera reported on February 26, 2025, on Israeli air raids targeting military bases and command centers in southern Syria and outside Damascus, specifically in Kiswa and Deraa ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus)). The Guardian also reported on February 25, 2025, on Israeli airstrikes on military targets in southern Syria, following demands for demilitarization, and mentioned hundreds of airstrikes against weapons depots and military infrastructure (![image 6638](media/2025-08-29_20-01-1756497676-613184.jpg), ![image 6639](media/2025-08-29_20-01-1756497677-014883.jpg), ![image 6632](media/2025-08-29_20-01-1756497672-769736.jpg), ![image 41](media/68.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel conducted airstrikes in the vicinity of Damascus in February 2025. The web search results from Al Jazeera and The Guardian specifically mention strikes on military targets in southern Syria and near Damascus, including locations like Kiswa and Deraa. The Guardian also mentions hundreds of airstrikes against weapons depots and military infrastructure.
