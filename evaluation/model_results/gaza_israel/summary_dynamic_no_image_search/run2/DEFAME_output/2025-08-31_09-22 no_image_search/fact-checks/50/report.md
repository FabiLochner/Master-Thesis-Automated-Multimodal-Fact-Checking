## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government ([Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and Harvard University ([Source](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)) discuss DNA testing in Israel within the context of the Israeli Law of Return, specifically regarding the determination of Jewish identity for immigration. A 1998 article from Nature.com ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)) mentions a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that DNA testing is relevant to Israeli law, particularly concerning the Law of Return and Jewish identity.
2.  A bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel existed.
3.  The evidence does not explicitly state that DNA testing is illegal in Israel.

**Insufficient Information**: The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not provide a definitive answer regarding the legality of DNA testing in Israel.


## Actions

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence focuses on the use of DNA testing in Israel, particularly in relation to immigration and the Law of Return.
2.  The evidence mentions a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information, but it does not confirm whether this bill was passed or what specific restrictions it entailed.
3.  The evidence does not explicitly state that DNA testing is illegal in Israel.

**Insufficient Information**: The claim cannot be verified. The evidence suggests that DNA testing is relevant in Israel and that there have been discussions about restricting its use, but it does not confirm whether DNA testing is illegal.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/): 
Content: PZ-Law.co.il discusses repatriation to Israel via DNA tests to prove Jewishness for immigration purposes. It states that DNA tests can be used if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens. The article mentions that DNA test results from other laboratories, especially those done before a relevant court decision and outside the procedure adopted by Israeli law, are not recognized.


## Elaboration
1.  The new evidence from PZ-Law.co.il ([Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)) indicates that DNA tests are used in Israel for repatriation purposes, specifically to prove Jewishness for immigration.
2.  The article states that DNA tests are accepted if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens.
3.  The article also mentions that DNA test results from other laboratories may not be recognized, implying that there are specific procedures and legal considerations regarding DNA testing in Israel.

**Conclusion**: The claim is false. The evidence suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, but it is subject to specific regulations and procedures, particularly in the context of immigration and proving Jewish identity.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that DNA testing is used in Israel, particularly for immigration purposes related to proving Jewish identity. While there are specific procedures and legal considerations, the evidence does not support the claim that DNA testing is illegal.

The most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, as evidenced by its use in repatriation cases to establish Jewish identity for immigration, as discussed by PZ-Law.co.il ([Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)). While specific regulations and procedures apply, the claim that DNA testing is illegal is false.
