## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs published an article on June 19, 2025, titled "Iran's Kamikaze Doctrine: Strategic Suicide as Deterrence" which includes an image of an explosion at Isfahan (![image 132](media/2025-07-18_13-28-1752845313-392533.jpg)). Times Now News published an article on October 26, 2024, discussing an Israeli attack on Iran, and the image ![image 9](media/9.jpg) is used to illustrate the event. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) website was last updated on July 18, 2025, and the image ![image 9](media/9.jpg) is not present in the search result.
