## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5025215/france-elections-2024-analysis](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5025215/france-elections-2024-analysis)) discusses the first round of the French legislative elections in which Marine Le Pen's National Rally party gained a strong lead. The Economist discusses the 2024 French legislative elections, where the National Rally (RN) led by Marine Le Pen did not secure the majority ([https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-elections-2024-polls-macron-le-pen](https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-elections-2024-polls-macron-le-pen)).

Politico reports that the left-wing alliance won the most seats, dealing a blow to Marine Le Pen's far-right party in the 2024 French legislative elections ([https://www.politico.eu/article/france-legislative-election-2024-second-round-front-populaire-jean-luc-melenchon-raphael-glucksmann-shock-victory/](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-legislative-election-2024-second-round-front-populaire-jean-luc-melenchon-raphael-glucksmann-shock-victory/)). The first round of voting was on June 30.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 20](media/27.jpg)) appears in a Vanity Fair article discussing anti-Semitism in France, specifically mentioning a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, where a swastika was painted on a statue. The same image is also found in an article on the World Jewish Congress website and in an article by Adam Milstein in The Jerusalem Post, which also discusses the 2014 protest.

## Elaboration
The claim is demonstrably false. The image depicts a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris from July 26, 2014, as confirmed by reverse image searches. This event predates the 2024 French parliamentary elections. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that the left-wing alliance, not Le Pen's party, won the most seats in the 2024 elections.


## Final Judgement
The image is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, not a protest related to the 2024 French parliamentary elections. The 2024 elections also did not result in a victory for Le Pen's party.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as confirmed by a reverse image search, and therefore is not related to the 2024 French parliamentary elections. Furthermore, the 2024 elections did not result in a victory for Marine Le Pen's party, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5025215/france-elections-2024-analysis) and [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-legislative-election-2024-second-round-front-populaire-jean-luc-melenchon-raphael-glucksmann-shock-victory/).
