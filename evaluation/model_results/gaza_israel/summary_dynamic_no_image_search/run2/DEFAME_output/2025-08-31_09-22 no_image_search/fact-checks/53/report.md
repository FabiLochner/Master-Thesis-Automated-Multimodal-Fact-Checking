The Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html)) reported on July 25, 2024, that Trump posted on Truth Social, condemning pro-Hamas protests. The Tennessee Lookout ([https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)) reported on July 25, 2024, that Trump said on Truth Social he would welcome Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 5352](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913004-996719.jpg), ![image 5354](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913008-261964.jpg), ![image 5357](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913017-893899.jpg), ![image 5355](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913010-062431.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 13, 2024, an attempted assassination of Donald Trump occurred at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-biden-trump-07-13-24](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-biden-trump-07-13-24)) and C-SPAN ([https://www.c-span.org/liveEvent/?Trump-Rally-Shooting](https://www.c-span.org/liveEvent/?Trump-Rally-Shooting)). The shooter was killed by Secret Service agents, and Trump was shot in the ear. Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania)) identifies the perpetrator as Thomas Matthew Crooks.

CNN reported that Trump posted on Truth Social that he would be in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Sunday. C-SPAN provides videos and news clips regarding the event, including a clip of the House Announcement of Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was the target of an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, and that he posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, threatening those holding hostages in the Middle East with severe consequences if they are not released before January 20, 2025. The article does not mention any statement by Trump regarding Israel or the assassination attempt. The article was published on July 25, 2024. ![image 11568](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636513-192813.jpg), ![image 11567](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636512-862768.jpg), ![image 11569](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636513-524886.jpg).


## Elaboration
The Times of Israel article ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/)) reports on a Truth Social post by Donald Trump on July 25, 2024. However, the article does not mention the claim's statement.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The initial search confirmed that Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024. However, the search results did not provide any information about the content of Trump's posts on July 25, 2024, specifically regarding his reaction to the assassination attempt or any statement about Israel. A subsequent search for the specific quote also did not yield any results.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, saying, "I hope that America obliterates Israel," cannot be verified. While it is confirmed that Trump posted on Truth Social on that date and was the target of an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, searches for the specific quote did not yield any results. The available evidence, including a report from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/)), does not support the claim.
