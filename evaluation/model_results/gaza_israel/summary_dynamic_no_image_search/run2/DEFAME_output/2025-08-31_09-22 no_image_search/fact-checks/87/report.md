### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da): Found exact image on website with title: ALTERED: This photo of a drone surveilling PM Netanyahu is ...
Content: The search result from PesaCheck states that the image ![image 56](media/87.jpg) is altered. The original photo was taken in 2009 and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The article claims the altered image was not shared by IRGC in 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Benjamin Netanyahu in his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is false. The reverse image search reveals that the image is altered. The original photo was taken in 2009 and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father.


## Final Judgement
The image has been identified as altered. The original photo was taken in 2009 and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. Therefore, the claim that the image shows Benjamin Netanyahu in his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is not accurate.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in question is an altered version of a photo taken in 2009, not a recent capture by Hezbollah. The original photo shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da)).
