Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/aug/05/joe-biden-iran-israel-gaza-jordan-latest-middle-east-crisis-live): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 5, 2024, discussing the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including a drone attack on northern Israel by Hezbollah. The article mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his statements regarding the situation in Gaza. The article also reports on the delivery of medical supplies to Lebanon by the World Health Organisation. <image:51> is included in the article.

The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image is an old photo, as indicated by the Kashif.ps article ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/)), and was republished during recent events, not specifically on August 25, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
