## Claim
Claim: "![image 23](media/34.jpg) This image shows Israel bombing Tehran on October 26, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 23](media/34.jpg))
geolocate(![image 23](media/34.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 23](media/34.jpg)

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.44, 'Palestine': 0.44, 'Malta': 0.03, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image was most likely taken in either Israel or Palestine. The claim states that the image shows Israel bombing Tehran, which is in Iran. The evidence does not support this claim. The geolocation data does not include Iran. The reverse image search did not provide any additional information.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image's geolocation data does not include Iran, where Tehran is located. The claim states that the image shows Israel bombing Tehran, which is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in question was likely taken in either Israel or Palestine, not Tehran, Iran, as the claim suggests. The evidence does not support the claim that the image depicts Israel bombing Tehran.
