## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A fact-check from aol.com, published on December 12, 2024, states that the claim of Tomer Bar's death in a Hezbollah drone strike is false, with no evidence to support it. ![image 9359](media/2025-08-30_00-44-1756514675-797503.jpg) The article also mentions that Bar is not listed among the military personnel killed since October 27.

Inshorts, citing Reuters, reported on December 9, 2024, that Israeli Air Force chief Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed in a November drone attack. The rumor emerged after a ceasefire announcement between Israel and Hezbollah. The hindrajabfoundation.org also mentions Tomer Bar, the Commander of the Israeli Air Force.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Major General Tomer Bar is the current Commander of the Israeli Air Force, assuming office on April 4, 2022, according to his Wikipedia page ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Bar)). The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/tags/tomer-bar](https://www.jpost.com/tags/tomer-bar)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/tomer-bar/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/tomer-bar/)) have published articles mentioning Tomer Bar, including articles from 2024 and 2025. One article from The Times of Israel discusses a drone that hit a building in Yavne on December 10, 2024.
