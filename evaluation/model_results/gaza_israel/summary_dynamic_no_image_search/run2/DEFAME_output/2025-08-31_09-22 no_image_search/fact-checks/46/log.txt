Content: The search result from Dublin Live, published on November 3, 2024, discusses a music legend's criticism of Bono and Bob Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza, contrasting it with their activism during Live Aid in the 1980s.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thejc.com/news/world/bob-geldof-live-aid-palestine-c9o9ll0g): 
Content: The Jewish Chronicle published an article on July 15, 2025, stating that Bob Geldof was asked to organize a "Live Aid for Palestine" but refused. <image:k>

The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
