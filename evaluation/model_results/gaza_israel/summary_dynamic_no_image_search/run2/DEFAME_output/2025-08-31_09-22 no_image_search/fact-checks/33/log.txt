The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While there was an attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the plot was orchestrated by an Iranian government official, not Jewish Americans, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department)). The evidence does not support the assertion that Israel wants American money and servicemen for a war with Iran, although the economic impact of such a war is discussed in sources like TRT World ([https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
