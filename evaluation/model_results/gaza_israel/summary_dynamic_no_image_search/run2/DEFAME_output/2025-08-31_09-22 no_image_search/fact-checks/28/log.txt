The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Ethiopia expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While the Israeli ambassador was expelled from an African Union event in April 2025, the expulsion was at the request of the AU Commission Chairperson, and there is no evidence to suggest that Ethiopia initiated the expulsion. Furthermore, reports from the same period indicate Israel's commitment to strengthening ties with Ethiopia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
