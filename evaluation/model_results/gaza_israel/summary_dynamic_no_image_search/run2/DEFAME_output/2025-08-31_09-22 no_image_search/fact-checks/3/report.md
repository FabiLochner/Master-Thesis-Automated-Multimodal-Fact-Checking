## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The Bangkok Post published an article on February 20, 2025, titled "Israelis under Thai immigration microscope in Pai" which discusses an investigation into the activities of Israelis in Pai, Thailand, and includes the image ![image 3459](media/2025-08-06_14-14-1754489692-450780.jpg)
. The Pattaya Mail published an article on August 6, 2025, discussing a controversy surrounding Israeli tourists in Pai, Thailand, and includes the image ![image 4](media/3.jpg)
. The tourists clarified their visit was for tourism.



## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts Israelis in Pai, Thailand. The Bangkok Post and Pattaya Mail articles, published in February and August 2025, respectively, mention an investigation and controversy surrounding Israelis in Pai. The tourists stated they were there for tourism.

The claim that the Israelis in the image have stopped fighting wars and moved to become settlers is not supported by the evidence. The evidence only indicates their presence in Pai, Thailand, and their stated purpose of tourism.


## Final Judgement
The image is confirmed to be of Israelis in Pai, Thailand, as evidenced by articles from the Bangkok Post and Pattaya Mail.
