The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including reports from the Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-erdogan-discuss-gaza-syria-in-good-and-productive-phone-conversation/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-erdogan-discuss-gaza-syria-in-good-and-productive-phone-conversation/)), indicates that Turkish President Erdogan and U.S. President Trump discussed Syria in March 2025 and that Erdogan has been critical of Israel. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
