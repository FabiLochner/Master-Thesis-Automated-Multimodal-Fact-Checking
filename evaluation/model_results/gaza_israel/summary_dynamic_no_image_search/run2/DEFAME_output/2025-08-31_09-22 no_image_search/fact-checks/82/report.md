## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e4m6m1r4eo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e4m6m1r4eo)) discusses the escalating cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon, mentioning Hezbollah and Israeli officials, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and the impact of the attacks. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) discusses the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah, and mentions the ongoing Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict. The CBS News article ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golan-heights-attack-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golan-heights-attack-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes/)) discusses the recent attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, including a rocket attack on a Golan Heights soccer field, and mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. ![image 11740](media/2025-08-31_10-59-1756637941-780507.jpg), ![image 11743](media/2025-08-31_10-59-1756637944-332148.jpg), ![image 51](media/82.jpg), ![image 11747](media/2025-08-31_11-00-1756638028-547862.jpg), ![image 11748](media/2025-08-31_11-00-1756638028-818824.jpg), ![image 11750](media/2025-08-31_11-00-1756638029-075048.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and that there have been attacks between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. The provided articles do not mention the specific date or location.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to a lack of information regarding the image's context and the specific date of the event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from Kashif.ps ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/)) states that the image ![image 51](media/82.jpg)

## Elaboration
The Kashif.ps article ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/)) indicates that the image is an old photo, and it was republished during the recent bombing of sites in Israel by Hezbollah.

This suggests that the claim is likely false, as the image is not from the specific event described in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image is an old photo that was republished during recent events. The claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on August 25, 2024, is therefore not accurate.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image is an old photo, as indicated by the Kashif.ps article ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/)), and was republished during recent events, not specifically on August 25, 2024.
