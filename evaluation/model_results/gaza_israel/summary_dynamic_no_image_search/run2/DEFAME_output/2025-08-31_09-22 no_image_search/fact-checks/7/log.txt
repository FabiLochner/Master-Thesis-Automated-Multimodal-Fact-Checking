Useful result: From [Source](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/trump-us-halting-military-campaign-houthis/): 
Content: The Air & Space Forces Magazine published an article on May 6, 2025, stating that Donald Trump announced the U.S. would halt its airstrikes against the Houthis, citing promises from the rebel group to stop attacking commercial shipping lanes. <image:11278> The article mentions a "ceasefire agreement" brokered by Oman, ensuring freedom of navigation.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to the provided evidence, the U.S.-Houthi ceasefire and cessation of military operations occurred in 2025, not after Trump won the 2024 election. Specifically, Donald Trump announced the U.S. would stop bombing the Houthis, and the Houthis agreed to stop interrupting shipping lanes in the Middle East, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-us-will-stop-bombing-houthis-after-agreement-struck-2025-05-06/) and [Air & Space Forces Magazine](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/trump-us-halting-military-campaign-houthis/).
