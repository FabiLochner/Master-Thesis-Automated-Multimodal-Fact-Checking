The altered image, which was shared on Facebook on August 11, asked if a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian. Channel 12 did not broadcast the purported poll and debunked the false posts in Hebrew on August 9.

The original poll was a 2022 Channel 12 poll. Another article discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The article mentions a related poll from Channel 12.
