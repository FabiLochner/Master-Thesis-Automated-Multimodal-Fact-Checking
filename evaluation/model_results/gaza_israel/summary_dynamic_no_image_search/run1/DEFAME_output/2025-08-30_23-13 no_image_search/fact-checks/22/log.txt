Content: The article from ABP Live fact-checks an image of Mike Tyson with a Palestinian flag, claiming it is fake and likely AI-generated. The article states that the image was not taken before his fight with Jake Paul on November 15, 2024. The article provides evidence of manipulation, including visual discrepancies in the image, such as the absence of Tyson's tattoo and incorrect flag design. <image:10749>, <image:10751>, <image:10752>, <image:10753>, <image:10754>, <image:10755>, <image:10757>. The article also mentions that Tyson has not publicly taken a partisan stance in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The article was published on November 20, 2024.

The claim '<image:10212> This is an authentic image of Mike Tyson posing with the Palestinian flag in the ring before his fight against Jake Paul on November, 15, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including fact-check articles from Reuters and ABP Live, confirm that the image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is a fake, likely generated by AI, and was not taken before his fight with Jake Paul ([Reuters](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/news-and-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/fact-check--mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ahead-.detail.html), [ABP Live](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-on-netflix-mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ai-generated-viral-image-1732403)).
