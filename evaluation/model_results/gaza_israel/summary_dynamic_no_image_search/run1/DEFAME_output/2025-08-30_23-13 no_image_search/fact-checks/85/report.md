## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image in the claim is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12 (![image 10249](media/85.jpg)). The original poll, broadcast on May 27, 2022, asked about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism. The altered image, which falsely presented a question about soldiers and rape, was shared on Facebook and X. Channel 12 denied broadcasting the poll and debunked the false posts.
