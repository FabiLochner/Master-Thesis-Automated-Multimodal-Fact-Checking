Justification: The search results from The Guardian, BBC, and Al Jazeera show that Keir Starmer made statements in October 2024 regarding the conflict in the Middle East, including calls for ceasefires and de-escalation, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
