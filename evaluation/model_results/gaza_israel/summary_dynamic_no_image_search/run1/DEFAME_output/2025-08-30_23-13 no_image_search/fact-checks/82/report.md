## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. ![image 12133](media/2025-08-31_00-14-1756599278-358790.jpg), ![image 12134](media/2025-08-31_00-14-1756599278-597829.jpg), ![image 12136](media/2025-08-31_00-14-1756599279-240914.jpg), ![image 10246](media/82.jpg)


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

None of the provided sources mention the context of the image in the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results provide information about Smotrich's presence in various locations and events, but none of them mention the context of the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because the provided evidence does not support it. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, nor do they provide any context for the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was present at other events, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on that date ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)).
