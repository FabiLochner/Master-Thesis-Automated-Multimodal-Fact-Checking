### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip)) discusses the March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, which targeted multiple locations, including Deir al-Balah, and resulted in over 591 deaths. The UN News article ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261)) reports that an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al-Balah killed at least one UN staff member and injured five others. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital)) reported on an Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. ![image 10234](media/65.jpg), ![image 11679](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598506-915789.jpg), ![image 11690](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598516-323299.jpg), ![image 11691](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598516-903283.jpg), ![image 11692](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598517-259492.jpg), ![image 11693](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598517-776719.jpg).


## Elaboration
The reverse image search indicates that the image was taken in Nabatieh, South Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, and not in Deir al-Balah in March 2025. The geolocation data suggests Palestine as a possible location, but the reverse image search contradicts this. The web search confirms that there were attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but the provided image is not related to those events.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is from an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, South Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, and not from Deir al-Balah in March 2025. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image, as revealed by a reverse image search, depicts an Israeli strike in Nabatieh, South Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, and not an event in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, as the claim suggests ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)).
