Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

 of [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
 and [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
, the [International Criminal Court](/wiki/International_Criminal_Court "International Criminal Court")
 (ICC) issued [arrest warrants](/wiki/Arrest_warrant "Arrest warrant")
 for two senior [Israeli](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 officials, [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
, the [prime minister of Israel](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel "Prime Minister of Israel")
, and [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, the former [Minister of Defense of Israel](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
, alleging responsibility for the war crime of [starvation as a method of warfare](/wiki/Starvation_(crime) "Starvation (crime)")
 and the crimes against humanity of [murder](/wiki/Murder "Murder")
, [persecution](/wiki/Persecution "Persecution")
, and other inhumane acts during the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-BBC_arrest_warrants_issued-1)
[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
 The warrant against Netanyahu is the first against the leader of a Western-backed democratic country for war crimes.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

All [125 ICC member states](/wiki/States_parties_to_the_Rome_Statute "States parties to the Rome Statute")
, including France and the United Kingdom, are required to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they enter the state's territory.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 military commander [Mohammed Deif](/wiki/Mohammed_Deif "Mohammed Deif")
, who was killed in an [Israeli airstrike on 13 July 2024](/wiki/13_July_2024_al-Mawasi_attack "13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack")
 but whose death remained unconfirmed at the time.[\[a\]](#cite_note-7)
 By January 2025 Hamas confirmed Deif's death, and a few weeks later the ICC cancelled the arrest warrant against him.[\[7\]](#cite_note-:1-8)

 Warrants may still be issued against additional Israeli senior IDF officers involved in the Gaza war.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)

Background
----------

Main article: [International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine](/wiki/International_Criminal_Court_investigation_in_Palestine "International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/International_Criminal_Court_2022.jpg/250px-International_Criminal_Court_2022.jpg)](/wiki/File:International_Criminal_Court_2022.jpg)

The premises of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands

The ICC was established in 2002 to prosecute [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
, [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
, [genocide](/wiki/Genocide "Genocide")
, and the [crime of aggression](/wiki/Crime_of_aggression "Crime of aggression")
 when member states are unwilling or unable to do so. The report also claimed that ICC judges had issued a gag order forbidding Khan from publicly revealing that he had requested the warrants.[\[29\]](#cite_note-30)
 The gag order was allegedly requested by members of Khan's staff who felt that his public announcements of the prior warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant "deviated from standard practice and put pressure on judges reviewing the warrant requests".[\[30\]](#cite_note-31)

Prior to taking indefinite leave from the prosecutor's office in May 2025, Khan was reportedly preparing draft arrest warrants for [Itamar Ben-Gvir](/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir "Itamar Ben-Gvir")
 and [Bezalel Smotrich](/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich "Bezalel Smotrich")
 for their involvement in building illegal settlements.[\[31\]](#cite_note-32)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-33)
 According to sources within the ICC, Khan had completed the warrant applications before taking his leave, but his deputies had not yet submitted them to the court.[\[33\]](#cite_note-34)

### Starvation as a weapon of war

One of the key allegations was the "use of starvation as a weapon of war".[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-36)
[\[36\]](#cite_note-37)
[\[37\]](#cite_note-38)
[\[38\]](#cite_note-39)
 The use of starvation as weapon of war is banned by the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")
.[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)
 Since then it has been used in both Gaza and Sudan.[\[40\]](#cite_note-41)
 In mid 2023 German government officials also accused Russia of using hunger as a weapon.[\[41\]](#cite_note-ips_journal-42)
[\[42\]](#cite_note-ipg_journal-43)
 Yoav Gallant made a public speech in early October 2023, shortly after the [Hamas attacks on Israel](/wiki/7_October_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel")
 that sparked the war, saying, "there will be no more electricity, no more food, no more fuel ... We are fighting against human animals and will behave accordingly."[\[43\]](#cite_note-44)
[\[44\]](#cite_note-45)
[\[45\]](#cite_note-46)
 A few weeks before that the arrest warrants were issued, there were also reports of looting occurring in areas controlled by the IDF.[\[46\]](#cite_note-47)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-48)

Possible execution of the arrest warrants
-----------------------------------------

### Speculated January 2025 visit to Poland

In December 2024 and January 2025, the possibility of Netanyahu visiting Poland, [party to the Rome Statute](/wiki/States_parties_to_the_Rome_Statute "States parties to the Rome Statute")
, on 27 January, the 80th anniversary of the [liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp](/wiki/Liberation_of_Auschwitz_concentration_camp "Liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp")
 was discussed by Polish politicians. The spokesperson stated that states with concerns about their obligations could consult with the ICC, but were not permitted to unilaterally determine the validity of the ICC's legal decisions.[\[51\]](#cite_note-OKOpress_ICC_calls_on_PL-52)
 Legal scholars [Karolina Wierczyńska](/w/index.php?title=Karolina_Wierczy%C5%84ska&action=edit&redlink=1 "Karolina Wierczyńska (page does not exist)")
, [Piotr Hofmański](/wiki/Piotr_Hofma%C5%84ski "Piotr Hofmański")
 and [Omer Bartov](/wiki/Omer_Bartov "Omer Bartov")
 stated that Netanyahu would have to be arrested if he visited Poland. Member of the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 [Tomasz Trela](/wiki/Tomasz_Trela "Tomasz Trela")
 stated that Netanyahu would have to be "instantly" arrested the moment he crossed the Polish border.[\[48\]](#cite_note-OKOpress_govt_decree_undermines-49)
 Under Polish law, the [Rome Statute](/wiki/Rome_Statute "Rome Statute")
 is an international treaty obligation with legal priority above that of a Cabinet resolution.[\[52\]](#cite_note-Rzeczpospolita_procedure_ICC_fugitives-53)

Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland. Instead, it indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack. The evidence also shows that Netanyahu was later offered protection by Poland due to an ICC arrest warrant, but this was not related to the missile attack.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) also reported on the attack. Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack, stating that Iran "made a big mistake" (<image:1>).

The articles mention that Israel, with the help of the US, intercepted a large number of the missiles launched by Iran (<image:12214>, <image:12215>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland. Instead, it indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack. The evidence also shows that Netanyahu was later offered protection by Poland due to an ICC arrest warrant, but this was not related to the missile attack.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as confirmed by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence that Netanyahu fled to Poland. Although Poland later offered Netanyahu protection due to an ICC arrest warrant, this was unrelated to the missile attack.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

German Reconnaissance Company

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Final Judgement
The image provided shows the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24, which took place in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The claim states that the image shows U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). The web search results confirm that the U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, in August and September 2024. However, the image itself is not related to the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not related to the claim. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim depicts the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024 as stated in the claim. While there was an increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East in August and September 2024, the image is unrelated to this. Therefore, the claim is false.

At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where thousands were sheltering, Palestinian officials said.

The Israeli military said it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital.

Footage filmed by CNN inside the hospital morgue showed dead bodies on the floor and people coming in to identify their loved ones, with children among the deceased.

The emergency room is seen to be overwhelmed by casualties and has no more space for patients. One young man was seen receiving medical treatment on the floor.

Most of those brought to the hospital with injuries are children, including one young boy who was receiving treatment and soon after died with the word “unidentified” written on his stomach.

The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.

Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”

The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, [nearly 2 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)
 had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.

Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.

“People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.

On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism [this week](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html)
 over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”

Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.

“As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”

Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html)
 killed 90 people and injured 300 more.

An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.

Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.

Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel."

The UN condemned earlier this month what it called the “increasing frequency” of Israeli strikes on schools

At least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City, the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority says.

A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood.

The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians.

Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area.

The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed.

Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike.

The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building.

"We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion," witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency.

"The people are gone, they're dead. They are under the rubble."

Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people.

He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel.

"Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence," it added.

The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied.

Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the "increasing frequency" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them "with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities".

The warning after [at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8erk37yn2no)
, according to the director of a local hospital.

The IDF said the school had "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 "terrorists" who were killed.

The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities.

The US secretary of state discussed the ceasefire talks with Egypt's president

Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah.

The IDF said its troops and aircraft had "eliminated numerous terrorists" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device.

It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

The BBC's Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation.

After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties.

But Hamas accused the US of "acquiescing" to what it called Mr Netanyahu's "new conditions".

! The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement.

A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected.

He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit a school being used by displaced Palestinians in central Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 30 people including several children, as the country’s negotiators prepared to meet international mediators to discuss a proposed cease-fire.

At least seven children and seven women were among the dead taken from the girls' school in Deir al-Balah to Al Aqsa Hospital. The Israeli military said one of its aircraft attacked from the air as part of its activity in Nablus.

According to Israeli estimates, about 1.8 million Palestinians shelter in the zone after being uprooted multiple times during Israel’s punishing air and ground campaign. "What happens is when people have these orders, they have very little time to move.”

Palestinians displaced by the Israeli air and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip flee from parts of Khan Younis on Saturday, following an evacuation order by the Israeli army to leave parts of the southern area of Gaza Strip's second largest city. Israel's military said it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against Israeli troops and develop and store "large quantities of weapons.” Hamas in a statement called the military’s claim false.

Civil defense workers in Gaza said thousands had been sheltering in the school, which also contained a medical site.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl)) reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, which resulted in at least 30 deaths. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City on August 20, 2024, which was sheltering displaced people, resulting in at least 12 Palestinian deaths. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike)) also reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza on July 27, 2024, which was being used as a shelter by displaced Palestinians, resulting in at least 30 deaths.

The CNN article does not include the image in the claim. The NPR article includes images <image:12320>, <image:12323>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence from CNN, BBC News, and NPR reports on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. These reports describe attacks on schools, resulting in casualties. However, none of the articles include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The NPR article includes images of the aftermath of the airstrikes, but they do not match the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the source of the image and whether it is related to the reported events.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. This aligns with the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image, such as the date or the cause of the rubble.

The evidence from the web search provides information about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. While the image could potentially be related to these events, there is no direct link established.

To further verify the claim, it would be necessary to identify the source of the image and confirm its context, including the date and the cause of the damage.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City on August 20, 2024, which was sheltering displaced people, resulting in at least 12 Palestinian deaths. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike)) also reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza on July 27, 2024, which was being used as a shelter by displaced Palestinians, resulting in at least 30 deaths.

The CNN article does not include the image in the claim. The NPR article includes images <image:12320>, <image:12323>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence from CNN, BBC News, and NPR reports on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. These reports describe attacks on schools, resulting in casualties. However, none of the articles include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The NPR article includes images of the aftermath of the airstrikes, but they do not match the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the source of the image and whether it is related to the reported events.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:10254>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. This aligns with the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image, such as the date or the cause of the rubble.

The evidence from the web search provides information about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. While the image could potentially be related to these events, there is no direct link established.

To further verify the claim, it would be necessary to identify the source of the image and confirm its context, including the date and the cause of the damage.

Gaza: Baby pulled alive from rubble after Israeli air strike on Rafah
=====================================================================

Rescuers in the city of Rafah, southern Gaza, have pulled a baby girl alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike.

People used their hands to free Mariam Abu Akel from the debris, before a rescuer ran with her to a nearby hospital.

Doctors there swabbed her cuts.

The baby had been sheltering in a house with her family when the strike took place, which killed her mother and sister, Reuters reported. Her father and young brother survived.

The air strike killed 20 people and injured 55, according to a Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson.

More than 21,500 people - mostly children and women - have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. <image:12347>!Riyad Mansour (left) Permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN, and Jonathan Miller, Deputy Permanent Representative for Israel to the UN <image:12349>\

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Alamy.com search result confirms that the image in the claim, <image:10254>, is a stock photo of a Palestinian child in rubble. The Getty Images search result also shows images related to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the provided evidence does not specify the exact date or context of the image in the claim.

The BBC News article from December 2023 reports on the Israel-Gaza war, but the images in the article do not match the image in the claim.

Based on the evidence, the claim that the image shows a Palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike is plausible, given the context of the image and the events in Gaza. However, the exact date (July 2024) cannot be verified.

The provided evidence from CNN, BBC News, and NPR reports on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. These reports describe attacks on schools, resulting in casualties. However, none of the articles include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The NPR article includes images of the aftermath of the airstrikes, but they do not match the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the source of the image and whether it is related to the reported events.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. This aligns with the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image, such as the date or the cause of the rubble.

The evidence from the web search provides information about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. While the image could potentially be related to these events, there is no direct link established.

To further verify the claim, it would be necessary to identify the source of the image and confirm its context, including the date and the cause of the damage.

Network of Syria conspiracy theorists identified – study
========================================================

This article is more than 3 years old

Campaign disseminating disinformation sent thousands of tweets, often targeting the White Helmets, research finds

A network of more than two dozen conspiracy theorists, frequently backed by a coordinated Russian campaign, sent thousands of disinformation tweets to distort the reality of [the Syrian conflict](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/07/ten-grim-lessons-the-world-has-learned-from-a-decade-of-war-in-syria)
 and deter intervention by the international community, new analysis says.

[Data gathered by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD)](https://deadlydisinformation.org/)
 identified a group of social media accounts, individuals, outlets and organisations who disseminated disinformation about the conflict, with 1.8 million people following their every word. According to the research, the three principal false narratives that were promoted involved misrepresenting [the White Helmets,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories)
 the volunteer organisation working to evacuate people in Syria. They also focused on the denial or distortion of facts about the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and on attacking the findings of the world’s foremost chemical weapons watchdog.

The White Helmets became a target of Russian ire after documenting incidents such as the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun in 2017, which killed 92 people, a third of them children. A UN unit later concluded there were “reasonable grounds to believe that Syrian forces dropped a bomb dispersing sarin” on the town in Idlib province.

The new analysis, contained in a report by The [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria)
 Campaign, also found that official Russian government accounts played a key role in creating and spreading false content, with the Russian embassy to the UK and Syria playing a prominent role.

Of the 47,000 disinformation tweets sent by the core of 28 conspiracy theorists over seven years from 2015 to 2021, 19,000 were original posts, which were retweeted more than 671,000 times.

Among those named in the report as an influential spreader of disinformation are Vanessa Beeley, a self-described independent journalist whose conspiracy theories have been cited as evidence by Russia at the UN security council.

In September 2015 Beeley accused White Helmets of being in league with al-Qaida and other terrorist organisations, claiming that the footage they gather as they rescue civilians from bombed-out buildings is staged.

Farouq Habib, White Helmets deputy manager, said: “At first we really thought this could just be someone who didn’t have enough correct info, and we should contact her to explain.

But then with some research, we realised it’s deliberate and systematic.”

There is also a group of British academics accused of spreading pro-Syrian regime disinformation and conspiracy theories promoted by Russia. Since 2020, journalist Aaron Maté at the Grayzone is said by the report to have overtaken Beeley as the most prolific spreader of disinformation among the 28 conspiracy theorists identified. \[Maté rejects the claim – see 10 July 2022 footnote.\]

Lina Sergie Attar, founder and chief executive of Karam Foundation, said: “It’s insulting that a group of western conspiracy theorists think they hold a higher moral standard but just spread their lies.”

Others include Canadian independent journalist Eva Bartlett who appeared on a Syrian government panel at the UN, alleging that the White Helmets stage rescues. One version of the talk has been viewed 4.5m times on Facebook.

White Helmets volunteers are the most frequently attacked targets with more than 21,000 tweets designed to discredit the group or encourage attacks against their first responders. Hamid Kutini, a volunteer in north-west Syria said: “The \[Syrian\] regime and Russia makes our lifesaving work extremely risky through double-tap attacks. When we go to save people from a bombed site, they re-target the same area to kill the first responders.”

So far 296 volunteers have been killed in the line of duty since 2012.

The effect of this barrage of disinformation, according to The Syria Campaign, has been to sow confusion and doubt among government policymakers, helping create anti-asylum policies, normalisation of Syria’s Assad regime and emboldening Russian president Vladimir Putin to replicate the tactics in Ukraine.

“Syria was a testing ground for this type of disinformation activity and the lessons learned from this case can inform action on Ukraine and beyond,” a former official at the US Department of State told researchers.

The headline of this article was amended on 19 June 2022 to remove a reference to the network being “Russia-backed”. As indicated in the text, the network was “frequently backed by a coordinated Russian campaign”, but not exclusively so. It was further amended on 18 August 2022 to give additional attribution to the ISD study in the headings and opening paragraphs.

Strengthen Norms Against Chemical Weapons Use
=============================================

[Arms Control Today](/sections/arms-control-today)

  
January/February 2021  
By [Wardah Amir](#bio)

The last time Joe Biden was in the White House, the United States was concerned about the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Over the past four years, chemical attacks have continued within and beyond Syrian borders with the emergence of new state perpetrators. International norms established under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have been blatantly violated by state and nonstate actors as chemicals are misused as weapons.

![A Syrian girl holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a make-shift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma, Syria in 2018. The Trump administration was marked by its inconsistent response to instances of chemical weapons use in the past four years. (Photo: Hasan Mohamed//AFP/Getty Images)](/sites/default/files/images/ACT_Photos/2021_01/12_ACTJanFeb2021_Feature_Amir.png)Following the 2017 presidential inauguration, the Trump administration had to address immediately the use of chemical weapons by state actors when Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was assassinated with VX nerve agent in Malaysia. The United States blamed and sanctioned North Korea, which is not party to the CWC, for this fatal chemical attack.

Unfortunately, chemical weapons were used again as instruments of assassination when Russia employed Novichok nerve agent against its opposition. In 2018, Sergei and Yulia Skripal were injured in a chemical attack in Salisbury, United Kingdom. More recently in 2020, Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny survived another chemical poisoning by Russia, which has failed to adhere to its CWC commitments. In a bipartisan effort, U.S. lawmakers asked the Trump administration to impose additional sanctions on Russia following an investigation into the Navalny poisoning. Such a move will now likely fall on the Biden administration’s to-do list to hold Russia accountable for its use of chemical weapons.

It is important to hold chemical weapons perpetrators accountable because it sets a precedent that there are consequences for challenging the norms. These consequences can deter other actors from engaging in chemical weapons programs and attacks. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been generating reports on allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria, but it is the responsibility of states-parties to decide what they want to do with the findings of these reports because the OPCW is not mandated to be a judicial body. Therefore, the U.S. response to every chemical weapons attack, big or small, is important, not only to decide the fate of those violating the treaty but also to lead the international community to rally behind a common goal to reinforce the norms that have been broken.

The Trump administration’s response to chemical weapons use was inconsistent and seemed to vary by perpetrator. Although North Korea and Russia were sanctioned under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act), the Trump administration decided to launch military strikes against Syria on two occasions: following the 2017 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhun that killed at least 70 civilians and the 2018 chemical attack in Douma that resulted in at least 40 fatalities. The United States has attributed at least 50 chemical attacks to the Assad regime since the beginning of the civil war in Syria, and even though this far exceeds the allegations of use against North Korea and Russia, each instance of chemical weapons use, regardless of magnitude or scale, must be treated as a violation of international law.

In contrast to his military response in Syria, President Donald Trump decided to meet with Kim Jong Un at the 2018 Singapore summit, despite the assassination of Kim’s half brother. The two leaders discussed denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but failed to address North Korea’s chemical weapons program. Following the Salisbury incident, the United States joined its allies in another nonmilitary response with the diplomatic expulsion of 60 Russian intelligence officers. Although the United States should further explore nonmilitary options for reinforcing the norms, it is important that the redline be drawn equally for all users of chemical weapons.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s response failed to halt the contraventions of the CWC. The Trump administration did use military force to respond to chemical weapons use, but the United States can and should better utilize the nonmilitary toolbox: diplomacy, sanctions, and legal accountability.

The Biden administration should be prepared to issue a strong political statement condemning the increase in use of chemical weapons in recent years and calling out state perpetrators (North Korea, Russia, and Syria) by name. This statement should include the importance of international cooperation and appreciation for allies that work together to uphold CWC norms. Furthermore, the United States must not lose sight of Russia’s violations of the CWC when negotiating other arms control treaties, such as an extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Negotiating arms control agreements is of utmost importance, and the Biden administration should avoid stovepiping nuclear and chemical weapons issues when preparing for future bilateral and multilateral dialogues on arms control. Although it is important to engage the Russians on arms control, the Biden administration will have to face the challenge of negotiating with a CWC violator.

Next, the Biden administration should track the status of investigations on the Navalny poisoning and related U.S. sanctions against Russia. If Trump fails to respond to Russia’s most recent use of chemical weapons, against Navalny in August 2020, the responsibility will fall on the new administration not only to issue tougher sanctions under the CBW Act, but also to deliver a political statement to announce the sanctions and condemn Russia’s continued violation of the CWC.

T![Cambodian officials attend an online session of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' annual meeting on the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Of the treaty's 193 member states, 119 have satisfied the requirement to have national implementing legislation. (Photo: OPCW)](/sites/default/files/images/ACT_Photos/2021_01/13_ACTJanFeb2021_Feature_Amir_OPCW.png)he United States also should provide foreign assistance to CWC states-parties in good standing with international norms to develop their national laws to penalize the use of chemical weapons. Despite the requirement in the CWC for the 193 member states to have national implementing laws, currently 39 states-parties only have accomplished this partially, and 35 states-parties are not satisfying this requirement at all. In 2018, the United States joined about 30 countries and international organizations for the launch of the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, a promising French initiative to identify and penalize perpetrators and build legal capacities. The goal of the Biden administration should be to mitigate legal safe havens for users of chemical weapons around the world and to develop capacities via bilateral and multilateral engagements, such as this international partnership, so that each partner country has the capabilities to prosecute those that should never have broken CWC norms.

Alleged Chemical Attack in Syria Puts the World on Edge
=======================================================

 !Fanack <image:12392>[Fanack](https://fanack.com/author/fanackadmin/)

An alleged [chemical attack](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/analysis/ghouta-hospitals-shut-down-and-bodies-out-reach)
 on 7 April 2018 killed at least 42 people and injured more than a 1,000 in Douma, a town in the rebel-held enclave of [Eastern Ghouta](https://fanack.com/politics/features-insights/eastern-ghouta~96489/)
, outside Damascus. The international community responded immediately, accusing the [Syrian regime](https://fanack.com/syria/politics-of-syria/)
 of carrying out the attack. A week later, a coalition made up of the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and France launched an air strike, allegedly targeting chemical weapons plants in the country.

It is unknown if the strike was a success. The coalition claims it was whereas Russia said it had [intercepted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/russia-claims-syria-air-defences-shot-down-majority-missiles)
 71 of the 100 missiles reportedly launched.

The alleged attack came almost exactly a year after the [Khan Sheikhoun](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)
 chemical attack on 4 April 2017, whose effects looked exactly like this one. According to [medical sources](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/analysis/ghouta-hospitals-shut-down-and-bodies-out-reach)
, “The victims’ symptoms resemble that of sarin gas exposure such as difficulty breathing, vomiting and foaming from the nose and mouth. Chlorine attacks are not this deadly.”

The [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](https://www.opcw.org/)
 (OPCW), the implementing body of the  [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention)
 (CWC), set up its own independent fact-finding mission for Syria in 2014. It has investigated more than 70 cases of alleged toxic gas attacks in Syria since then. It is now investigating the Douma case, and has confirmed the use of a toxic gas. US officials [said](https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/984479890182430722)
 on 12 April that urine tests from Douma have tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent.

Douma has been a regular target of regime attacks for five years but has been under increased assault since [March 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/12/middleeast/syria-eastern-ghouta-divided-intl/index.html)
. The attacks allowed President Bashar al-Assad to [take Douma](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/12/syrian-flag-flying-onetime-rebel-stronghold-douma-russians-announce/)
 after the residents and rebels [fled](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack)
 in buses to Jarablus, a town near the Turkish border that is controlled by Ankara-backed rebel fighters. A [paramedic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack)
 told the Guardian newspaper, “I am leaving tomorrow, God willing, because our mission has ended. I am saying thank God that the mass killings are over, but I am saddened that I will leave my land and my people, possibly never to return. But I will leave knowing that I gave everything I could until the end.”

In a statement, the [European External Action Service](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/42639_en)
 (EEAS) said, ‘We call on the supporters of the regime, Russia and [Iran](https://fanack.com/iran/)
, to use their influence to prevent any further attack and ensure a cessation of hostilities.’

French President [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.france24.com/en/20180412-macron-says-has-proof-syrian-chemical-attack-vows-response)
 said on 12 April 2018 that France would decide to strike when all the necessary information was gathered. “We have proof that last week, now 10 days ago, chemical weapons were used, at least with chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of [Bashar al-Assad](https://fanack.com/syria/history-of-syria/bashar-al-assad-since-2000/)
,” Macron said, after it became known that France was coordinating with the US on a possible military response. He had already [declared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fnews%2fworldviews%2fwp%2f2018%2f04%2f09%2fanother-president-faces-a-red-line-on-syria-he-drew-himself%2f%3futm_term%3d.aac55cf5d550&utm_term=.aac55cf5d550)
, as former US President Barack Obama had done, that chemical weapons were a “red line” but has done nothing since the beginning of his presidency to put an end to it. The same day, UK Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/russia-us-war-live-updates-syria-war-crisis-latest-trump-nuclear-a8300821.html)
 called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the possibility of joining France and the US in a military strike. According to [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/11/theresa-may-moves-closer-joining-military-action-against-assad/)
, British submarines were ordered within missile range of Syria.

Yet it was the US that reacted most forcefully. On 9 April 2018, President [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/russia-us-un-security-council-syria-douma-attack)
 condemned the attack, saying he would decide in 24 to 48 hours if he was going to launch a reprisal offensive on Syria. In a [tweet](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/trump-animal-assad-tweet/)
, he denounced the ‘mindless CHEMICAL attack’ in Syria that killed women and children, called Bashar al-Assad an ‘animal’ and criticized Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/trump-big-price-to-pay-suspected-syria-chemical-weapons-attack)
 for supporting the Syrian government. [Asked by a reporter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/russia-us-un-security-council-syria-douma-attack)
 if Putin had any responsibility for the attack, Trump replied: “He may, yeah, he may. And if he does, it’s going to be very tough, very tough. Everybody’s gonna pay a price. He will, everybody will.”

In a subsequent tweet, Trump [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/politics/trump-syria-attack.html)
, ambiguously, that an attack in Syria ‘could be very soon or not so soon at all’. Just days after the [Khan Sheikhoun attack](https://fanack.com/politics/features-insights/chemical-weapons-attack~86433/)
 last year, the US [launched](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons)
 a cruise missile attack on a Syrian airfield, although it had no long-term consequence on the [war](https://fanack.com/syria/history-of-syria/the-syrian-crisis/)
.

In the wake of these announcements, [Eurocontrol](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria/u-s-russia-clash-at-u-n-over-chemical-weapons-attacks-in-syria-idUSKBN1HG0D8)
, the pan-European air traffic control agency warned airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours. [Kuwait Airlines](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/kuwait-airways-ends-beirut-flights-amid-syria-war-fears/1115994)
 exercised extreme caution, cancelling all its flights to Lebanon. An attack on 9 April 2018, apparently by [Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-syria-strike-netanyahu-says-israel-will-hit-all-those-who-seek-to-harm-us/)
, that killed 14 Iranian military personnel on a Syrian base added to regional tensions, although it later became clear that this attack was not connected to the events in Douma.

The situation continues to be volatile, leaving the world and especially Syria and its neighbours on edge, fearing for the last scraps of stability they have. Once again, the recent air strike by the US, UK and France has had few tangible results, and many suggest they should have focused their efforts on trying to overthrow the regime instead.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop.

For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City.

Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable.

Israel-Gaza: On board the plane evacuating injured Palestinians

Palestinians disembark an evacuation flight that has taken them from Egypt to the UAE

**Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering.**

The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds.

Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai.

After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

"During the war they were displaced," she tells me. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza.

I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is not from the Gaza war in July 2024. Reverse image searches indicate that the image was taken in Douma, Syria, in 2018, and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask. The claim is therefore false.

Content: "They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas’ vast tunnel network under Gaza.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp. According to countercurrents.org, they died on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school. The Wikipedia article mentions a separate event, the "2024 Nuseirat rescue and massacre," which occurred on June 8, 2024, but does not mention the children. The CNN article does not mention the image.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows Mayar and Bilal Hamida. However, the claim also states that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. The information about the children's deaths is confirmed, but the information about their mother and grandmother is missing.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

New Report! During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. [Photo Credit: Photo: Kevin Frayer/AP]")The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by Israeli forces is a reoccurring issue in the weekly field reports gathered by Al-Haq. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)

**GAZA CITY, Palestine**

A 70-year-old Palestinian woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, still grapples with the trauma of being viciously attacked by an Israeli army dog in her small home In Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, located in the northern Gaza Strip.

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.
