Content: The International Court of Justice published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The court found that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. The court also stated that Israel is obligated to end its unlawful presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. The court also stated that all states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/): 
Content: The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. <image:10577> The article mentions that the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution giving effect to the ICJ's opinion. The article urges global leaders to take steps to uphold the ICJ's findings and end Israel's illegal occupation.

The claim 'Israel has been declared an illegal state by the International Court of Justice in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to be unlawful, and obligated Israel to end its unlawful presence. While the ICJ's opinion did not explicitly declare Israel an "illegal state," it did find Israel's presence in the occupied territories to be unlawful, as reported by the UN ([https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/)).
