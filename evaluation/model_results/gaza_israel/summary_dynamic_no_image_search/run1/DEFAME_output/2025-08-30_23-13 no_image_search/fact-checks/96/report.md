## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published on countercurrents.org, Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, resulting in at least 16 deaths, including Mayar Haidar (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) ![image 10258](media/96.jpg). The CNN article discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, but does not mention the image.

The Wikipedia article discusses the "2024 Nuseirat rescue and massacre" that took place on June 8, 2024, in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where the Israeli military conducted an operation to rescue hostages, resulting in the deaths of at least 276 Palestinians and injuries to over 698 ![image 10258](media/96.jpg).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp. According to countercurrents.org, they died on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school. The Wikipedia article mentions a separate event, the "2024 Nuseirat rescue and massacre," which occurred on June 8, 2024, but does not mention the children. The CNN article does not mention the image.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows Mayar and Bilal Hamida. However, the claim also states that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. The information about the children's deaths is confirmed, but the information about their mother and grandmother is missing.

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school.

The claim that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother cannot be verified, as no evidence supports this statement.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school. However, the claim that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother cannot be verified due to a lack of evidence.
