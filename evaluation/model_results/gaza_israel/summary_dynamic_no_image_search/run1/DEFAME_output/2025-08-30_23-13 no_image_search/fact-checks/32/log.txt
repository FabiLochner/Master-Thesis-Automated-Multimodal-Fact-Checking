Useful result: From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/738007/Lebanon-Hezbollah-residence-Tomer-Bar-attack-drones): 
Content: Press TV reports that Hezbollah claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024. <image:11070>. The article mentions that the attack was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities.

The claim 'Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar has been killed by Hеzbollаh in Tel Aviv in a drone attack in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed by Hezbollah is false. Fact-checks from sources like [AOL](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html) and Inshorts confirm that he is alive. However, there are reports from Press TV that Hezbollah claimed to have targeted his residence in Tel Aviv with a drone attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
