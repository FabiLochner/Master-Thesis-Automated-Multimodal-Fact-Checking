Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html): 
Content: The Yahoo search result, published on October 22, 2023, fact-checks the claim that Anthony Bourdain said, "Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except courage. Courage is made in Palestine." The result states that there is no credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement and rates the claim as "Misattributed." <image:11292>, <image:11293> The oldest version of the quote found was from July 2021. The article also mentions Bourdain's visit to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for his CNN show.

The claim 'Anthony Bourdain once said, 'Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine.'' is false.
