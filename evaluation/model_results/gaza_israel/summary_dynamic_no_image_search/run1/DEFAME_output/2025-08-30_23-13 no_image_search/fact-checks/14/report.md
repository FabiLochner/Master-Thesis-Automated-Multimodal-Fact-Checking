## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 10207](media/14.jpg)) appears in articles about a toilet explosion in Noida, India. One article, published by The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms)), states the explosion was caused by methane gas buildup.

Another article from Orbit Standard ([https://orbitstandard.com/orbit-now/noida-toilet-explosion-man-severely-burned/](https://orbitstandard.com/orbit-now/noida-toilet-explosion-man-severely-burned/)) discusses the same incident, mentioning a man named Ashu suffered 35% burns.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on September 18, 2024, discussing explosions of Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon, which killed nine people and injured thousands. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the explosions. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo)) ![image 10624](media/2025-08-30_23-26-1756596415-371341.jpg), ![image 10627](media/2025-08-30_23-26-1756596416-040998.jpg), ![image 10625](media/2025-08-30_23-26-1756596415-606073.jpg)

CNN published an article on September 18, 2024, discussing the explosion of pagers used by Hezbollah members in Lebanon on September 17, 2024. ![image 10207](media/14.jpg) is not present in the article. The article includes images of people gathering outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) and an ambulance. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg)

The search result from Cambridge Core discusses the pager explosions that occurred in Lebanon on September 17, 2024. The explosions were caused by explosives planted inside pagers used by members of a specific party group. The article mentions that the explosions resulted in 2,800 injuries and 12 deaths. The article was published on October 28, 2024. ![image 10207](media/14.jpg) is not included in the search result.


## Elaboration
The claim is demonstrably false. The image depicts a toilet explosion in Noida, India, caused by methane gas buildup, not a Hezbollah pager explosion in Lebanon. The evidence from reverse image search and web search confirms this.


## Final Judgement
The image is not related to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon in September 2024. The image is from a toilet explosion in Noida, India. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image provided in the claim depicts a toilet explosion in Noida, India, caused by methane gas buildup, as evidenced by a reverse image search and articles from The Times of India and Orbit Standard. This is unrelated to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, which are documented by the BBC and CNN ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo)).
