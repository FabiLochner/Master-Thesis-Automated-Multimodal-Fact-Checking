## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A Harvard University article discusses the use of genetic tests in Israel for determining Jewishness and immigration rights, raising questions about its impact on Israeli law and society. ([Source](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)) A Nature.com article discusses a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel. ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247))

DNA test results are legally valid in Israel only if conducted under a court order and in licensed laboratories; tests done privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that it is not entirely illegal to do a DNA test in Israel. However, the legality and validity of DNA tests are subject to specific conditions.

DNA tests are legally valid in Israel if conducted under a court order and in licensed laboratories ([Source](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/)). Tests done privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts ([Source](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/)). A bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel has also been discussed ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)).

Therefore, the claim is partially false. While not entirely illegal, the use and validity of DNA tests are restricted.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that while DNA testing is not entirely illegal in Israel, its legality and validity are subject to specific conditions. Tests must be conducted under court order and in licensed laboratories to be legally recognized. Therefore, the claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel is not entirely accurate.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
It is not illegal to do a DNA test in Israel, but the validity of the test depends on specific conditions. DNA test results are legally valid only if conducted under a court order and in licensed laboratories; tests done privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts ([Source](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/)).
