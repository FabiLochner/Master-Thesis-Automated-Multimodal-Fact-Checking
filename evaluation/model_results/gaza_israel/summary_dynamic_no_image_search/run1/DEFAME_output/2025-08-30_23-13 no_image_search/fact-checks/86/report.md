### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies.

## Elaboration
The image (![image 10250](media/86.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image provided shows the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24, which took place in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The claim states that the image shows U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). The web search results confirm that the U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, in August and September 2024. However, the image itself is not related to the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not related to the claim. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024 as stated in the claim. While there was an increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East in August and September 2024, the image is unrelated to this. Therefore, the claim is false.
