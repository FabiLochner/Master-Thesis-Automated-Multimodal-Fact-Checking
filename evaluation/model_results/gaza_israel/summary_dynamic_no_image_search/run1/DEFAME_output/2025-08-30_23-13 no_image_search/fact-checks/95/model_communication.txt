Photo of Turkish man holding hand of dead daughter underlines earthquake despair

Image showing father from Kahramanmaraş region comes as death toll from Syria and Turkey quake pushes past 7,800

Videos and photographs of the two earthquakes that have devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, killing at least 7,800 people, show rescuers digging with their hands, apartment blocks concertinaing to the ground in seconds, and the shaking apart of a [castle](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/fears-for-ancient-sites-after-earthquake-destroys-parts-of-gaziantep-castle-turkey)
 that had stood for almost two millennia.

But few images depict the agony quite as plainly as a photograph from the Turkish region of Kahramanmaraş, in which a father holds the hand of his dead teenage daughter as rescuers and civilians pick through the flattened building where she died on Monday.

Sitting hunched in the rubble, Mesut Hancer keeps hold of 15-year-old Irmak as she lies on her bed beneath the slabs of concrete, smashed windows and broken bricks that were once apartments. Close to the father and daughter, a man with a sledgehammer tries to smash his way through the ruins.

The epicentre of the first earthquake was the Pazarcık district of Kahramanmaraş, which lies in south-east [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey)
. The initial, 7.8-magnitude earthquake was followed, hours later, by a second quake that measured 7.7 magnitude.

Elsewhere in Kahramanmaraş province, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble. One lay on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Rescuers quieted the throngs of people trying to help so they could hear survivors and find them.

On the other side of the border, the Associated Press described seeing a Syrian man holding a dead girl in his arms as he walked away from the debris of a collapsed two-storey building.

He and a woman set the girl on the floor under covering to protect her from the rain, wrapping her in a large blanket before looking back to the building. According to Agence France-Presse, [a newborn baby was pulled alive from the rubble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/syria-newborn-still-joined-to-dead-mother-pulled-alive-from-earthquake-rubble)
 of a home in northern Syria after relatives found her still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died in Monday’s quake.

Rescue efforts are being hampered by dozens of continuing aftershocks, freezing winter weather and the damage caused to roads leading in and out of the affected areas.

On Tuesday evening, the Turkish government said 4,500 people had been killed in the quake, with another 26,000 injured. The number of confirmed deaths on the Syrian side of the border – where the disaster has exacerbated the destruction wrought by more than 11 years of civil war – stood at at least 1,700 bringing the death toll in both countries to more than 6,200. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed.

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared the 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes disaster zones, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.

As men clamber over the ruins of the pancaked building, now shaped like a pyramid of rubble, one man sits still. 

Wearing an orange coat to protect himself from the winter freeze, Mesut Hançer perches on concrete slabs and twisted rebar — all that remains of the apartment block in Kahramanmaras, a Turkish city close to [the epicenter of Monday’s earthquake](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/oliveburd/turkey-syria-earthquake-photos)
. 

His face is still — his expression, blank. He is grief-stricken but resolute: He won’t let go of his daughter’s hand. 

  ! <image:12479>

Irmak, 15, was killed when the building collapsed. The girl’s body is sandwiched between a mattress, dirt, and the colossal weight of the upper floors of the building. All that peeks out is a lifeless, pale hand that her father steadfastly grips. 

“He never left the hand of his daughter who died in the earthquake,” wrote Adem Atlan, the photographer with Agence France-Presse who took the pictures of the grieving father on Tuesday, in an Instagram story uploaded Wednesday. 

"Unbelievable pain," he later [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/CochRLEq1H8/)
.

Adem Altan / AFP via Getty Images

Altan’s photos [went viral online](https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1622977020194959360)
 and were printed on newspaper front pages around the world on Wednesday from Turkey to Spain to the UK to the US. 

“With the courage of despair,” read the headline accompanying the photo in [Belgium's De Standaard newspaper](https://www.standaard.be/krant/archief)
. 

“A glimpse of pain and desperation among the ruins,” Brazil’s O Globo paper wrote in its headline for the picture. 

A 2015 photo of Mesut and Irmak uploaded by the girl [to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=846968168721806&set=pb.100002258936209.-2207520000.&type=3)
 shows the father and daughter smiling as they pose by a small water fountain. Almost eight years later, a different photo of the pair has been seen across the globe and become a defining image of tragedy.

Irmak is just one of a horrifyingly large number of people killed by Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which has devastated large swaths of Turkey and neighboring Syria.

More than 20,000 people are known to have died, according to [tallies from the Associated Press on Thursday](https://apnews.com/article/politics-syria-government-damascus-turkey-6ba6f153102945d93340dbf55e63d4bf)
, making the disaster one of the deadliest of the last decade. 

There are few more traumatized corners of the globe that the quake could have struck than Syria’s northwest. 

That country, plagued for more than a decade by a civil war that has wrought devastation and triggered a global refugee crisis, already had 15 million people in need of humanitarian aid even before the tremor began, according to David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.

“One of the deadliest earthquakes this century, followed by hundreds of aftershocks, now adds to a litany of devastation,” Miliband said in a statement shared with BuzzFeed News, calling for aid to begin “skyrocketing” in order to meet the desperate need.

Search and rescue efforts in the Besnaya district of Idlib, Syria, on Thursday. 

On Thursday, three days after the quake, the first convoy of aid trucks finally reached the opposition-held Idlib area in Syria’s northwest. The trucks arrived via the only crossing with the Turkish border that the United Nations has authorized for use but that had been blocked for days by damage.  

However, the White Helmets, a humanitarian group that assists in the region, said the aid was merely the same supplies that had preceded the disaster. “It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble,” the group [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SyriaCivilDef/status/1623667466860740608)
. “We are disappointed at a time when we are desperate for equipment that will help us save lives from under the rubble.”

Almost 2,000 people have died in the region, according to the White Helmets. Many of the dead had fled destruction and violence elsewhere in Syria only to lose their lives when buildings collapsed there.

As time passes, hopes dim that more people will be found alive — but there are still miracles. On Thursday, the White Helmets shared a photo of a young girl named Sham being pulled from the rubble. The group said her two siblings were also saved, but their mother was killed. 

Among the international figures who have arrived in the region to assist in relief and recovery efforts are a small contingent of 87 rescue workers from Ukraine, which itself has been plagued by war for the past year.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:10257>) shows Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. The event occurred in February 2023, not July 2024, and the location was Turkey, not Gaza.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/turkey-earthquake-man-photo-dead-daughter-hand](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/turkey-earthquake-man-photo-dead-daughter-hand)), BuzzFeed News ([https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/earthquake-turkey-syria-photo-father-daughter-hand](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/earthquake-turkey-syria-photo-father-daughter-hand)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl)) all published articles about the image.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in February 2023. The event occurred in Turkey, not Gaza, and the date was February 2023, not July 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a man in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in February 2023, not in Gaza in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the location, date, and context of the image. `false`

 [! The quote also says that the Israeli government and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “heartless criminals without a drop of humanity.” The same wording has been circulated on Russian-language [pages](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0SRBRLHpy3yUgpPSRqKTJB2yPeDom8hSAuiBumfx2B1Xexvszh93Ete8hJHQfRWx3l&id=100070217693211)

**The quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is fake. No such statement appears on any of the actor’s official pages, nor has it been reported by any reputable media outlet.**

The quote about the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government, allegedly made by Dwayne Johnson, is fabricated. Johnson expressed sympathy for the families of the victims.

__Screenshot of Dwayne Johnson’s post__

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)
 by the organization Snopes.

The appearance of the fake quote may be directly connected to events that occurred at the end of July. The city had been considered a key hub for the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.

**About the Source:**

Among others, the fake quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is being spread by a Facebook account belonging to [Zaal Mamatsashvili](https://www.facebook.com/zaal.mamatsashvili/posts/pfbid02ZV5icDdtmZzamBaPfkzkBa1LbrBuTVdevkkWGkfsuRSLoZVoFnzTAvrBqKq47j7l)

 on July 29 that, due to Israel's ongoing military offensive and [blockade](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-30-2025-9b9b516f22e61bd1dde879733fdd97aa)
, about 2 million Palestinians in Gaza were living in the "worst-case scenario of famine."

#### Sources:

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)
