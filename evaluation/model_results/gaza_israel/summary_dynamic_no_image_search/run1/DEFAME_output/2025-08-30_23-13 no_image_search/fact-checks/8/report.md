## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel launched attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The attacks were in retaliation for Iranian attacks and targeted military sites in Iran, Iraq, and Syria.

The image is present in the evidence, but there is no information about the image itself.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Israel': 0.3, 'Bangladesh': 0.04, 'Taiwan': 0.04, 'Ukraine': 0.04, 'China': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Bulgaria': 0.01, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01}

## Elaboration

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/satellite-images-show-damage-from-israeli-strikes-at-2-secretive-iranian-military-bases): 
Content: The PBS News article, published on October 27, 2024, discusses Israeli strikes on Iranian military bases on October 26, 2024. The strikes damaged facilities at the Parchin military base ![image 10522](media/2025-08-30_23-22-1756596151-320334.jpg) and the Khojir military base ![image 10523](media/2025-08-30_23-22-1756596154-051996.jpg). The article includes satellite images of the damage.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel launched attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The search for images related to the attacks revealed satellite images of damaged facilities at the Parchin and Khojir military bases. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts the attacks.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the image's connection to the attacks remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israel launched attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The search for images related to the attacks revealed satellite images of damaged facilities. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts the attacks.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the attacks did occur on the specified date. However, the image's connection to the attacks remains unverified. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported. While evidence confirms that Israel launched attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, the provided image's connection to those attacks remains unverified. The attacks targeted military sites, and satellite images of damaged facilities are available, but the image in the claim is not confirmed to depict the attacks.
