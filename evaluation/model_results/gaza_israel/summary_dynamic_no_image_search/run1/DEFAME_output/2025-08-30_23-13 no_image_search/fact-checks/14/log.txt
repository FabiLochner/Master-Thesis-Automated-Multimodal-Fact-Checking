Content: The search result from Cambridge Core discusses the pager explosions that occurred in Lebanon on September 17, 2024. The explosions were caused by explosives planted inside pagers used by members of a specific party group. The article mentions that the explosions resulted in 2,800 injuries and 12 deaths. The article was published on October 28, 2024. <image:10207> is not included in the search result.

The claim '<image:10207> This image shows the aftermath of an explosion of a Hezbollah pager in Lebanon in September 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image provided in the claim depicts a toilet explosion in Noida, India, caused by methane gas buildup, as evidenced by a reverse image search and articles from The Times of India and Orbit Standard. This is unrelated to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, which are documented by the BBC and CNN ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo)).
