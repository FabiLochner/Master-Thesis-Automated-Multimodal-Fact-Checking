Content: The New York Post published an article on September 25, 2024, discussing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania. <image:963> The article suggests that Zelensky's visit appeared to be a partisan political event, as he was accompanied by Democratic candidates and guarded by Secret Service agents. The article raises questions about the expenses and the potential for foreign interference in US politics.

The claim '<image:10235> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory in September 2024, not Israeli bombs as the claim suggests. The shells were intended for use in Ukraine's war with Russia, not against Palestinians in Gaza.
