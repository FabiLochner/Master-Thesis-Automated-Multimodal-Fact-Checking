Justification: The claim is false. While Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, the image provided is AI-generated, as reported by France 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20240924-this-viral-image-of-the-ramat-david-airbase-hezbollah-attack-is-ai-generated](https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20240924-this-viral-image-of-the-ramat-david-airbase-hezbollah-attack-is-ai-generated)).
