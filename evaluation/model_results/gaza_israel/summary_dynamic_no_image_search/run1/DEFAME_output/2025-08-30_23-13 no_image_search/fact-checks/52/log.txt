Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that the population of Gaza has declined by 6% since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While one source, the NYCFPA, states a 2.02% population increase since October 7, 2023, based on pre-war forecasts ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)), CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% decrease during the same period, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics ([Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl), [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)). The latter reports reflect actual population changes during the war.

So, the overall veracity is: false
