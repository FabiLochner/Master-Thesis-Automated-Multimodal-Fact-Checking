### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on February 19, 2025, stating that Hamas would return the bodies of four hostages, including the Bibas family. The article mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed in an Israeli air strike in November 2023. ![image 10796](media/2025-08-30_23-30-1756596627-501648.jpg) shows a protester holding signs calling for the release of Shiri Bibas and her children Kfir and Ariel.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 10216](media/30.jpg)) appears in multiple news articles. CBC News published on February 18, 2025, reported that Hamas said it would return the bodies of four hostages, including the Bibas family, and mentions the Bibas family were among the hostages seized in the October 7, 2023 attack. The USA TODAY article, published on February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Kfir and Ariel Bibas. CNN published an article on June 7, 2025, stating that Israel killed the leader of a Palestinian militant group involved in the October 7, 2023 attacks and mentions the Bibas family.

The BBC did publish an article on February 19, 2025, about the Bibas family. The article mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed in an Israeli air strike in November 2023. The image in the claim is a screenshot of a BBC article. Therefore, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The BBC did publish an article in February 2025 about the Bibas family, and the image in the claim appears to be a screenshot of that article. The article discusses Hamas's claim that the family was killed in an Israeli air strike.
