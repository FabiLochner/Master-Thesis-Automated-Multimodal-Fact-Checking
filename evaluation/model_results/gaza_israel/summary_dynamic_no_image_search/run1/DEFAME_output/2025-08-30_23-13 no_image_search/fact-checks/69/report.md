## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10237](media/69.jpg) was found on multiple websites. One website, [Nournews](https://www.nournews.ir/ar/tag/46494/%D8%B9%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%81%D8%A9), contains the image and mentions events from July 28, 2021. Another website, [ansarollah.com.ye](https://ansarollah.com.ye/archives/%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86?page=1175), also contains the image and includes articles about Palestine and Israel dated from March 21 to March 26, 2018. The website [ghadnews.net](https://www.ghadnews.net/2025/01/01/%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9/) published on January 1, 2025, uses the image and discusses Israeli forces entering West Bank cities.


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.68, 'Israel': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.03, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli military actions in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria. One article from Syria Weekly ([https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation](https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation)) mentions retaliatory strikes in western Daraa following a rocket attack. Hawar News Agency ([https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties](https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties)) and FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa)) report on clashes and operations in Tasil, with FRANCE 24 mentioning the seizure of weapons and destruction of infrastructure. The image ![image 10237](media/69.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Israeli military forces entering Tasil in February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Reverse image searches show the image has been used in articles from 2018, 2021, and January 2025, predating the February 2025 date in the claim.

Web searches confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including Tasil. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date or the specific context of the image.

The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel, which aligns with the presence of Israeli military forces. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's location as Tasil.


## Final Judgement
The image has been used in articles from 2018, 2021, and January 2025, predating the February 2025 date in the claim. While web searches confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including Tasil, the evidence does not confirm the exact date or the specific context of the image.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not from February 2025. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. Reverse image searches show the image has been used in articles from 2018, 2021, and January 2025, predating the February 2025 date in the claim. While web searches confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including Tasil, the evidence does not confirm the exact date or the specific context of the image.
