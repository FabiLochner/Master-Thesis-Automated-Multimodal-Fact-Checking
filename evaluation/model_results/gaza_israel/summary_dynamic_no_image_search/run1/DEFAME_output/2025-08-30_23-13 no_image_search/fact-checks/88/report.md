## Claim
Claim: "![image 10252](media/88.jpg) This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 10252](media/88.jpg))
geolocate(![image 10252](media/88.jpg))
web_search("Esmail Qaani hijab disguise")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10252](media/88.jpg)

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The image ![image 10252](media/88.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post published an article about Esmail Qaani, the head of the IRGC's Quds Force, and includes a picture of him, mentioning his wariness of assassination ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988)). The Washington Institute also published an article discussing Qaani's leadership struggles, including a picture of him ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

## Elaboration
The additional search results provide more context about Esmail Qaani. The Jerusalem Post article mentions his wariness of assassination, which aligns with the claim's suggestion of disguise due to fear. However, the articles do not confirm that the image ![image 10252](media/88.jpg)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/505094-Esmail-Qaani-target-of-a-Zionist-disinformation-campaign-amid](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/505094-Esmail-Qaani-target-of-a-Zionist-disinformation-campaign-amid)) and WANA News ([https://wanaen.com/from-rumor-to-reality-general-esmail-qaani-remains-on-the-scene/](https://wanaen.com/from-rumor-to-reality-general-esmail-qaani-remains-on-the-scene/)) both report on disinformation campaigns and rumors surrounding Esmail Qaani, with the Tehran Times specifically mentioning a Zionist disinformation campaign. The Miâ€™raj News Agency (MINA) ([https://en.minanews.net/iranian-commander-esmail-qaani-refutes-death-rumors-with-public-appearance/](https://en.minanews.net/iranian-commander-esmail-qaani-refutes-death-rumors-with-public-appearance/)) reports on Qaani's public appearances to refute death rumors. The articles include images of Qaani ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

## Elaboration
The search results indicate that the image ![image 10252](media/88.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the image is likely a misrepresentation. While Esmail Qaani is a real person and there are reports of disinformation campaigns targeting him, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts him in disguise. The search results point to the image being part of a disinformation campaign.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Esmail Qaani is a real person, and there are reports of disinformation campaigns targeting him, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts him in disguise. The search results indicate that the image is likely a misrepresentation and part of a disinformation campaign, as reported by sources like the [Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/505094-Esmail-Qaani-target-of-a-Zionist-disinformation-campaign-amid).
