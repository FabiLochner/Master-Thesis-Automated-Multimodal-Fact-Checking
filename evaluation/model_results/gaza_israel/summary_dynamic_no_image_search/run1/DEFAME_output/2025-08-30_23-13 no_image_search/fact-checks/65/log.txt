Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, which began on March 18, 2025, and ended the 2025 Gaza war ceasefire. The attacks targeted Rafah, Khan Yunis, Deir al-Balah, Nuseirat, Bureij, Al-Zaytoun, Al-Karama, and Beit Hanoun. The attacks resulted in over 591 deaths, mostly women and children. <image:10234> The article mentions that the attacks were a surprise and that the Israeli military stated they were targeting Hamas leaders and infrastructure. However, the attacks have been condemned by human rights organizations.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2025, reporting on an Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. <image:11679>, <image:11690>, <image:11691>, <image:11692>, <image:11693>. The article mentions the condemnation of the attack by the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the US president, Donald Trump. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described the event as a "tragic mishap".

Useful result: From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261): 
Content: The UN News article, published on March 19, 2025, reports that at least one UN staff member was killed and five others injured in an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al Balah, central Gaza Strip. <image:10234> The article mentions that the Israeli military denied attacking the compound, which was known by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The UN Secretary-General condemned the attacks and called for a full investigation. The article also states that the incident occurred around 11:30 AM local time on Wednesday.

The claim '<image:10234> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image, as revealed by a reverse image search, depicts an Israeli strike in Nabatieh, South Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, and not an event in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, as the claim suggests ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
