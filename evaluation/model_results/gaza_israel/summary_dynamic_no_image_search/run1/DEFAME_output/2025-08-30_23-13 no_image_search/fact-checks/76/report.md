## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)) both report that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. The post includes an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass.

The Daily Dot ([https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mel-gibson-the-end-of-israel-fake-post/](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mel-gibson-the-end-of-israel-fake-post/)) also confirms the post is fake, and that Gibson does not have any social media accounts. ![image 10242](media/76.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)), Yahoo ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)), and The Daily Dot ([https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mel-gibson-the-end-of-israel-fake-post/](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mel-gibson-the-end-of-israel-fake-post/)), confirm this.

The claim that the image shows an authentic social media post from Mel Gibson is therefore false. The evidence also states that Gibson does not have any social media accounts.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence from multiple reliable sources confirms that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. The post, which includes an altered Israeli flag, did not originate from Gibson.
