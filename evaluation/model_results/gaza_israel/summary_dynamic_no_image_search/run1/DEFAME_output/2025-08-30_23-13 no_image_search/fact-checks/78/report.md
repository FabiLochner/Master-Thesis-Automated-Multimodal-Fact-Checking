## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources confirm that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, codenamed "Operation True Promise II" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)). Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) also reported on the attack. Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack, stating that Iran "made a big mistake" (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

The articles mention that Israel, with the help of the US, intercepted a large number of the missiles launched by Iran (![image 12214](media/2025-08-31_00-16-1756599386-801039.jpg), ![image 12215](media/2025-08-31_00-16-1756599387-188559.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland. Instead, it indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack. The evidence also shows that Netanyahu was later offered protection by Poland due to an ICC arrest warrant, but this was not related to the missile attack.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland. While Poland offered Netanyahu protection later due to an ICC arrest warrant, this is unrelated to the missile attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as confirmed by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence that Netanyahu fled to Poland. Although Poland later offered Netanyahu protection due to an ICC arrest warrant, this was unrelated to the missile attack.
