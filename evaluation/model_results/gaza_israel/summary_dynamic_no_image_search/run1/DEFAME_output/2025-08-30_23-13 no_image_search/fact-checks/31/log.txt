Content: "<image:10853>

AN IMAGE SHARED by Yanis Varoufakis, a former Greek finance minister, that purports to show Irish rock stars holding Israeli flags is AI-generated.

The image, which is said to show Bono and Bob Geldof staging a “two-man vigil” outside the Israeli Embassy in Dublin, was first posted by a satirical social media account, which has confirmed to _The Journal_ that it was created by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and was never meant to be taken seriously.

“In the midst of a genocide, with thousands of maimed orphaned children going to bed without having eaten for days or water to wash their wounds, Bono and Geldof decided to show their solidarity with the rogue Apartheid state responsible,” wrote Yanis Varoufakis on X.

Varoufakis’s 18 December X post includes a screenshot of another post by the account Dr Harold News, which showed an image of Bono and Geldof in a field holding Israeli flags.

! <image:10854>

“BREAKING: Bono and Bob Geldof stage two-man vigil outside Israeli Embassy in Dublin,” that post reads.

Varoufakis’s post has been shared more than 600 times and was viewed on X more than 306,100 times. It was also shared further on other social media platforms, including multiple posts on Facebook that copied Varoufakis’s post word-for-word.

Varoufakis was Greece’s minister for finance for much of 2015, gaining international recognition during the country’s debt crisis.

However, there are signs that the image he shared may not be real.

The picture is set in a field surrounded by verdant hedges, unlike t[he area outside the Israeli embassy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embassy+of+Israel+to+Ireland/@53.3323915,-6.2317407,3a,75y,311.48h,82.18t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s5IbuSW6FiE9GXIaxKw2zEw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.817675335494144%26panoid%3D5IbuSW6FiE9GXIaxKw2zEw%26yaw%3D311.48243025252697!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x48670ec099e519d1:0x8e1e9dcda8ab035e!8m2!3d53.3323109!4d-6.2323792!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F12qh79y9q?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
, which, aside from some leafy residential gardens across the road, is located in a concrete-laden area of Dublin city.

Last week, Israel announced it [is closing that embassy down](https://www.thejournal.ie/israel-closes-embassy-dublin-6572656-Dec2024/?jrnl_lg=1)
, following Ireland’s decision to intervene in a case taken by South Africa against Israel for genocide that is currently before the International Court of Justice.

The clothes worn by the two rock stars in the image are inconsistent, with Bono’s buttons being of various sizes (including one on the bottom of this suit jacket’s lapel), and a ridge appearing on one sleeve of Geldof’s jacket, but not the other.

These are all indications that the image might be AI-generated.

Reverse image searches for the image, or similar images that may have been manipulated, all indicate that the Dr Harold News account was the first to post the picture.

“My page is clearly labelled ‘satire’ and ‘fake news’, so I wasn’t expecting anyone to assume the photo is real,” the person behind the account told _The Journal._

“I can confirm the image was created by Grok AI and the tweet is satire.”

Grok AI is an Artificial Intelligence platform that can create images based on image prompts. <image:10852>\

The Verdict: Fake The image, first shared by a satirical account, is fake and was likely created using Artificial Intelligence.

### **What is the claim?**

An image of Irish musicians Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli national flag has circulated online, claiming that they are endorsing “apartheid”. In 2023, Bono [condemned](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/culture-stories/1708419663-u2-draft)
 the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and voiced support for peace between the two sides.

### **The verdict**

The viral image of Irish musicians Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli national flag is a fabrication, most likely created using Artificial Intelligence.

The image gained traction after Irish singer [Mary Coughlan](https://www.instagram.com/coughlan804/?hl=en)
 criticised Bono and Geldof for not speaking out about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. She remarked, “We all saved the world when Bob and Bono were talking about saving the world, and I couldn’t understand what was different about this situation in Gaza."

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-bono-holding-173242187.html): 
Content: The AOL article, published on December 27, 2024, states that the image of Bono and Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags is AI-generated. The article mentions that the image was first circulated by an X account known for fake news and satire. The article also notes that there is no proof of the supposed vigil. <image:10938>, <image:10939>.

The claim '<image:10217> This is an authentic image of Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli flag outside the Israeli embassy in Dublin.' is false.
Justification: The image depicting Bono and Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags is AI-generated, as reported by an AOL article ([Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-bono-holding-173242187.html)). The image originated from an X account known for spreading fake news and satire, and there is no evidence to support the claim of a vigil.

So, the overall veracity is: false
