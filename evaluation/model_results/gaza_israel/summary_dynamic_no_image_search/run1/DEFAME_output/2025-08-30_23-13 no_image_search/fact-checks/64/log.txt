Content: The Jerusalem Post reports on June 25, 2025, that Esmail Qaani was seen at a rally in Tehran. <image:k> The New York Times reported that Qaani was killed during an Israeli strike in Iran, citing an Iranian source.

The claim 'Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were reports of Esmail Qaani's death in June 2025, and conflicting reports about his whereabouts, including appearances in Tehran, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel in April 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
