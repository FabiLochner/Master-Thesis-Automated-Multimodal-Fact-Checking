## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources discuss the whereabouts of Esmail Qaani, the IRGC Quds Force commander. According to articles from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/esmail-qaani/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/esmail-qaani/)), Qaani's appearances and whereabouts have been reported in 2023, 2024, and 2025, including reports of him being missing, under arrest, or attending events in Tehran and Beirut. One article from June 28, 2025, mentions a funeral in Tehran for military commanders killed in Israeli strikes <image:k>.

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) states that in June 2025, The New York Times reported, via Iranian state media, that Qaani was killed in Israeli airstrikes <image:k>. However, a social media video from June 24, 2025, showed Qaani in Tehran, contradicting the reports of his death. Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018)) reported on June 25, 2025, that Qaani was seen alive in Tehran, contradicting earlier reports of his death <image:k>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902): 
Content: The Jerusalem Post reports on June 25, 2025, that Esmail Qaani was seen at a rally in Tehran. <image:k> The New York Times reported that Qaani was killed during an Israeli strike in Iran, citing an Iranian source.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates conflicting reports about Esmail Qaani's status in April 2025. While the claim states he fled to Israel, the provided sources do not support this.
2.  Reports from June 2025 show Qaani alive in Tehran, contradicting reports of his death in Israeli strikes.
3.  The evidence does not provide any information about Qaani being in Israel. The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence does not support the claim that Esmail Qaani fled to Israel in April 2025. The search results show conflicting reports about his whereabouts, including reports of his death and appearances in Tehran. There is no information about him being in Israel.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there were reports of Esmail Qaani's death in June 2025, and conflicting reports about his whereabouts, including appearances in Tehran, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel in April 2025.
