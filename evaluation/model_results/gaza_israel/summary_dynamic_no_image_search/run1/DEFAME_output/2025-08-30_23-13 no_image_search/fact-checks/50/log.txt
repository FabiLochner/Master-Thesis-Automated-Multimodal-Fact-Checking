Content: The website states that DNA test results are legally valid in Israel only if the test is conducted pursuant to an order issued by an Israeli court and carried out in accordance with the prescribed legal procedure. It also mentions that DNA testing is conducted exclusively in licensed laboratories in Israel and that tests performed privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts. <image:11443>, <image:11444>, <image:11445>, <image:11446>, <image:11447>.

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: It is not illegal to do a DNA test in Israel, but the validity of the test depends on specific conditions. DNA test results are legally valid only if conducted under a court order and in licensed laboratories; tests done privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts ([Source](https://pravoisrael.us/dna/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
