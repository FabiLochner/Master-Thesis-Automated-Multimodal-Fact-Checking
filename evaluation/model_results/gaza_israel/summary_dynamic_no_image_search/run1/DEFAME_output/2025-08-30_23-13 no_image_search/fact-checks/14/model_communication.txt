In a shocking incident in the National Capital Region, a young man, Ashu, suffered severe burns when his toilet exploded. His father, Sunil Pradhan, reported that Ashu sustained 35% burns and was hospitalized. Authorities suspect methane gas buildup from clogged drains as the cause, though the spark's origin remains unclear.

A bizarre and frightening accident took place in the National Capital Region of the country, when a usual visit to the bathroom turned into a nightmare for a young man who suffered some serious injuries as his home’s toilet exploded!Ashu’s father, Sunil Pradhan, described the horrifying moment, “The blast left Ashu with severe burn injuries to his face and body. He was rushed to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, where doctors confirmed he had suffered 35% burns,” said a TOI report. Importantly, he clarified that Ashu wasn’t using any mobile phone or electronic gadget at the time, ruling out some common theories like gadget explosions.While this might sound like something from a bizarre news column, this kind of accident could actually happen anywhere, especially in homes with aging or poorly maintained plumbing systems.

Poll

Do you believe that regular maintenance of plumbing systems can prevent accidents like toilet explosions?

Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessary

What really happened?  

------------------------

According to early assessments, the explosion was not triggered by electrical issues. The home’s air conditioning and all other appliances were functioning properly at the time. But the real reason behind this blast was the least expected but potentially dangerous cause, the methane gas buildup.The family suspects that methane may have accumulated inside the toilet bowl due to a clogged drain, and a spark might have ignited the gas, leading to the explosion, though the source of the spark is unclear.

![Representative Image](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms)

Local resident Harinder Bhati shared his concerns, saying, “Pipes here are not just old, but they haven’t been cleaned in years. Choked pipes can lead to the accumulation of gas, which can explode under pressure.” This sentiment was echoed by experts, including a chemistry professor, who explained that methane can indeed collect in sewer lines and confined bathroom spaces, particularly where ventilation is poor or drains are blocked.Despite the alarming nature of the incident, AP Verma, a senior manager of the Greater Noida Authority, stated, “The system is clean and functioning normally. It appears that the explosion might have resulted from some internal problem within the house.” However, he did not clarify what those internal problems could be.

Why could this happen anywhere?  

----------------------------------

This incident is a wake-up call about how aging plumbing, poor ventilation, and neglected sewage maintenance can create dangerous conditions even in modern homes. While such explosions are rare, it is advised that homeowners regularly inspect and clean their plumbing systems, especially in older buildings, to prevent dangerous gas buildup.

**Toilet Explosion in Noida Home Leaves Man With Severe Burns—And It Could Happen Anywhere**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Orbit Standard | Urban Hazards**

In a terrifying and highly unusual accident in **Greater Noida**, a young man suffered **35% burn injuries** when a toilet in his home suddenly **exploded**, turning a mundane trip to the bathroom into a medical emergency.

Advertisement

The victim, identified as **Ashu**, was immediately rushed to the **Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS)** in Greater Noida after the unexpected blast severely burned his face, arms, and upper torso. His father, **Sunil Pradhan**, confirmed the incident and said the family was still in shock.

* * *

### **No Electronic Devices Involved, Say Family**

Speaking to Orbit Standard, Pradhan explained, “Ashu was not using any mobile phone or electronic gadget. We’ve ruled out the usual culprits like phone explosions. The blast came out of nowhere while he was simply in the bathroom.”

This clarification has prompted officials to investigate **structural or chemical causes**, particularly the **dangerous buildup of methane gas** in the household drainage system. Early assessments point to methane accumulation from clogged or deteriorated sewage lines as the probable reason for the explosion.

* * *

### **How Can a Toilet Explode?**

While rare, toilet explosions are **not impossible**, especially in buildings with **aging infrastructure** or **poor drainage systems**. Methane gas—produced from decomposing organic matter—can accumulate in closed plumbing networks and ignite upon exposure to a spark. Even static electricity or a minor electrical fault could be enough to trigger an explosion in the presence of trapped flammable gases.

In this case, investigators are still working to determine what may have triggered the blast. One possibility is **a spark from wiring**, though a definitive cause has yet to be confirmed.

* * *

### **Residents on Edge**

Local resident **Harinder Bhati**, a neighbor, shared his concerns with Orbit Standard:

> “We’re all really shaken. Who would’ve thought a toilet could be dangerous? The authorities need to check all the drains in the area. What happened to Ashu could happen to any of us.”

The incident has raised alarms about the **urgency of plumbing maintenance**, especially in urban and semi-urban areas where sewage systems are often overloaded or neglected.

* * *

### **What Experts Say**

Experts in urban sanitation warn that as Indian cities grow rapidly, many households continue to rely on outdated or improperly maintained drainage systems. Without regular inspections or safety protocols, **gases like methane** can easily build up and become hazardous.

“If there’s inadequate ventilation in the sewage line or if the traps are dry, methane buildup is very likely,” said a municipal engineer familiar with the matter. “What’s crucial is regular flushing, pipe ventilation, and having your drainage system checked annually.”

* * *

### **Is Your Bathroom Safe?**

To avoid such freak accidents, plumbing professionals recommend:

*   **Regular sewage line inspections**
*   **Maintaining ventilation in plumbing systems**
*   **Ensuring all water traps stay filled** (dry traps allow gases to escape)
*   **Avoiding open flames or electrical work near bathrooms with poor ventilation**

Hezbollah blames Israel after pager explosions kill nine and injure thousands in Lebanon

Watch: Small explosion in Lebanon supermarket

Nine people, including a child, have been killed after handheld pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah to communicate exploded across Lebanon, the country’s health minister says.

Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among 2,800 other people who were wounded by the simultaneous blasts in Beirut and several other regions.

Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said the pagers belonged “to employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions” and confirmed the deaths of eight fighters.

The group blamed Israel for what it called “this criminal aggression” and vowed that it would get “just retribution”. <image:10624>!AFP Lebanese army soldiers block an entrance of a southern suburb of Beirut (17 September 2024) <image:10627>AFP

A statement put out by the Israeli military on Tuesday evening did not comment on the pager explosions, but said the chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi had held a situational assessment with commanders "focusing on readiness in both offence and defence in all arenas".

It also said there was no change in defensive guidelines to the Israeli public but asked them to remain alert and vigilant.

Earlier in the day, the military said an air strike had killed three “Hezbollah terrorists operating within a terrorist infrastructure site” in the Blida area, near Lebanon’s border with Israel.

Lebanon’s health ministry confirmed that three people had been killed in an Israeli strike, while Hezbollah’s media office said it had carried out missile and drone attacks targeting Israeli troops and military sites.

Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service also said it had foiled a Hezbollah bomb attack targeting an unnamed former senior Israeli security official. <image:10624>!EPA Friends and relatives of injured people arrive at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) in Beirut, Lebanon (17 September 2024) <image:10625>EPA

Hezbollah did not say what it believed had caused the pagers to explode.

The Wall Street Journal cited a source as saying the affected devices were from a new shipment that Hezbollah had received in recent days. The Israeli military declined to comment.

Hours before the explosions, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah attacks on the north of the country to allow the safe return of displaced residents was an official war goal.

There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.

Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Iran-backed Palestinian group.

In its latest statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah said it would carry on its "operations in support of Gaza", adding that this was a “continuous path separate from the hard price that awaits the enemy in response to its massacre on Tuesday”.

Both Hezbollah and Hamas are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.

The UN's spokesman said the latest developments in Lebanon were "extremely concerning, especially given that this is taking place within a context that is extremely volatile".

---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpw5rqzz5jjo)

Many Lebanese were in a state of shock and disbelief on Tuesday evening, unable to get their heads around an event that was unprecedented in scale and nature.

Hezbollah said an unspecified number of pagers - which the group relies on heavily for communications due to the risk of mobile phones being hacked or tracked - exploded at around 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) in the capital Beirut and many other areas.

[One CCTV video showed an explosion in a man’s bag or pocket at a supermarket](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cevy90jzr9xo)
. Later, the source said the son of another lawmaker, Hassan Fadlallah, was wounded, having initially reported that he was dead.

Fourteen people were also wounded by exploding pagers in neighbouring Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting alongside government forces in the country's civil war, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

“We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,” Hezbollah said in a statement on Tuesday evening.

“This treacherous and criminal enemy will certainly get his just retribution on this sinful aggression from where it counts and from where it does not count,” it added.

Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati also blamed Israel for the explosions, saying that they represented a “serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards”.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he told his Lebanese counterpart that he "strongly condemned Israeli terrorism".

The US, Israel's closest ally, denied any involvement and urged Iran not to heighten tensions.

! A Hezbollah official also told the newspaper some people had felt the pagers heat up before the blasts.

Overheated lithium-ion batteries can catch fire, but experts said hacking into the pagers and making them overheat would not usually cause such explosions.

A former British Army munitions expert, who asked not to be named, told the BBC the pagers would have likely been packed with between 10g and 20g of military-grade high explosive, hidden inside a fake electronic component.

Once armed by a signal, called an alphanumeric text message, the next person to use the device would have triggered the explosive, the expert said.

Lina Khatib, a Middle East analyst at the UK-based Chatham House think tank, told the BBC: "Israel has been engaging in cyber operations against Hezbollah for several months, but this security breach is the largest in scale.”

Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based senior fellow of the American think tank the Atlantic Council, said: “Israel in one fell swoop has rendered combat ineffective hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah fighters, in some cases permanently.”

He warned that Hezbollah's leaders would now “face extreme pressure from the ranks and supporters to retaliate heavily”, describing it as "the most dangerous moment" in the Hezbollah-Israel conflict since October.

! “It’s very sensitive and some scenes are horrific,” one staff member told the BBC.

Most of the wounds were at the level of the waist, face, eyes and hands, he said, adding: “A lot of casualties have lost fingers, in some cases all of them.”

The wife of Iranian ambassador Mojtaba Amani said he was "slightly injured" by one of the explosions and that he was "doing well" in hospital.

Hezbollah's media office announced the deaths of eight fighters. Hezbollah did not comment on the accusation.

This comes at a time when Israel's government is threatening to step up its military effort against Hezbollah.

On Tuesday morning, Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of 60,000 residents displaced in the north by Hezbollah attacks an official goal of the Gaza war.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said during a meeting with US envoy Amos Hochstein on Monday that the only way to return northern residents was through "military action".

“The possibility for an agreement is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas, and refuses to end the conflict,” a statement from his office said.

Since the hostilities escalated in October, at least 589 people have been killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, according to the Lebanese health ministry.

On the Israeli side, 25 civilians and 21 members of security forces have been killed, the Israeli government says.

* * * It did not give details on the locations and circumstances, saying only that they were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem".

A source close to the group told AFP news agency that the son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar and the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member in the Bekaa Valley were among those killed."

This is considered one of the key building blocks of the powerful group that has long been accused of operating as a state-within-a-state.

At the start of the year, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called on members and their families in southern Lebanon, where fighting with Israeli forces across the border has raged, to dump their cellphones, believing Israel could track the movement of the Iran-backed terror network through those devices.

David Kennedy, a former US National Security Agency intelligence analyst, told CNN the explosions seen in videos shared online appear to be “too large for this to be a remote and direct hack that would overload the pager and cause a lithium battery explosion.”

Human operatives inside Hezbollah would have been key to the operation, he added.

Abstract

On September 17, 2024, at 15:30 local time, thousands of pagers used by members of a specific party group detonated across Lebanon. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc

* * *

On Tuesday, September 17, 2024, at 15:30 local time, thousands of pagers used by members of a specific party group detonated across Lebanon, lasting for around an hour.[1](#r1)
, [2](#r2)
 These explosions were caused by small amounts of explosives planted inside pagers purchased from a Taiwanese company that were ordered months before the explosion.[1](#r1)
 The pagers exploded after a coded message was sent, simultaneously activating the explosives.

Narrative
---------

As a result of the explosions, 2,800 were wounded, and 12 lost their lives, among them two children and four health care workers, according to the Lebanese Minister of Health.[1](#r1)
, [3](#r3)

Most of the injured were individuals who reached for their pagers to check the notifications and consequently sustained injuries to the hands and eyes.[3](#r3)
 Almost two-thirds of the 2,800 injured needed surgery for the face, eyes, or hands.[3](#r3)
 More than 60% to 70% of the patients ended up with at least one eye removed and many suffered amputations.[3](#r3)
 The injuries were divided across Lebanon as follows: 750 in the south of Lebanon, 150 in the Bekaa Valley, and about 1,850 in the capital and its suburbs.[3](#r3)

At the Lebanese American University Medical Center (LAUMC), a private university hospital in the capital of Beirut, 38 injured patients presented to the hospital. Then, hospitals can develop education, trainings, and conduct regular exercises incorporating these lessons in preparation for future disasters.

Acknowledgments
---------------

The authors would like to thank all the health care personnel in Lebanon who have worked relentlessly during the response, especially the hospital staff at the Lebanese American University Medical Center.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:10207>) appears in articles about a toilet explosion in Noida, India. One article, published by The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms)), states the explosion was caused by methane gas buildup.

Another article from Orbit Standard ([https://orbitstandard.com/orbit-now/noida-toilet-explosion-man-severely-burned/](https://orbitstandard.com/orbit-now/noida-toilet-explosion-man-severely-burned/)) discusses the same incident, mentioning a man named Ashu suffered 35% burns.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. The image depicts a toilet explosion in Noida, India, caused by methane gas buildup, not a Hezbollah pager explosion in Lebanon. The evidence from reverse image search and web search confirms this.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Fact Check: Did Mike Tyson Pose With Palestinian Flag Before Fight With Jake Paul? No, Viral Image Could Be AI
==============================================================================================================

Viral images purporting to show Mike Tyson with a Palestinian flag are fake and likely AI-generated. Tyson has not publicly endorsed a partisan stance in the Israel-Palestine conflict.

**The Verdict \[Fake\]**

* * *

The viral images depicting boxer Mike Tyson draped in a Palestinian flag before his fight with Jake Paul are fake and appear to be AI generated.

### **What's the claim?**

Viral posts on Facebook, TikTok, Bluesky, and X feature images of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson in the ring with a Palestinian flag draped over his shoulders. These posts claim the image was taken before his fight with Jake Paul on November 15, 2024. 

Other versions of the claim suggest the image was taken the day before the fight and shows Tyson expressing support for the Palestinian cause. Archived versions of some of these posts can be found [here](https://perma.cc/3PUB-M5JU "here")
, [here](https://perma.cc/4XMT-UAGQ "here")

, [here](https://perma.cc/FFY6-8AHV)
, and [here](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/KBz72 "here").

We also discovered iterations of the image on TikTok (archived [here](https://perma.cc/5BVY-EGP8 "here")
 and [here](https://perma.cc/7CNL-P4BH "here")
) using [Logically Accelerate](https://logically.ai/accelerate "Logically Accelerate")
, a tool that enables proactive discovery of fact-check-worthy content on various platforms.

However, our analysis revealed numerous visual discrepancies in the viral images of Tyson with the Palestinian flag wrapped around him, indicating they were likely created using AI technology. An analysis with AI detection tools also found substantial evidence of manipulation.

### **What discrepancies did we find?**

Reverse image searches did not identify any legitimate sources for the image or any evidence supporting its authenticity. There were no reports of Tyson displaying solidarity with Palestine before or during the fight, and no coverage of the event included this image.

Additionally, the text overlay in one of the viral posts misquotes Tyson as saying, "I am stand with Phalastine (sic)," with a misspelling of Palestine and a grammatical error. There are no credible reports or social media posts of Tyson making such a statement.

A comparison of the viral images with [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aja2KfuoqGA "highlights")
 (archived [here](https://perma.cc/68UK-BAJ8 "here")
) available online and an edited livestream of the fight uploaded by Netflix revealed further inconsistencies. Tyson has a prominent tattoo on his left pectoral region in honor of his late daughter Exodus, which is missing in the viral images. Furthermore, Tyson's facial tattoo around his left eye appears significantly larger and lighter in the manipulated images. The design of the tattoo does not match the actual one seen in verified footage of the fight.

In one of the viral images, there is also an additional tattoo below Tyson's right eye, which does not exist in real life.

The tattoo around Mike Tyson's left eye appears much more distinct in the viral image, while in reality, it has faded. The viral image also omits Tyson's tattoo of his late daughter Exodus on his left pectoral region. (Source: X/ESPN/Modified by Logically Facts)

Further discrepancies were identified in Tyson's attire and the depiction of the Palestinian flag. In the fight, Tyson wore boxing shorts with the BYLT logo, a brand he represents, and his name embroidered on the waistband. The viral images feature nonsensical words on the shorts, differing significantly from his actual fight attire. Additional gibberish text was visible on the boxing ring ropes, further suggesting AI manipulation.

!Both viral images contain several indicators of AI generation, such as gibberish written on Mike Tyson's boxing shorts that do not match what he wore in the fight, as well as gibberish written on the tightropes in the background. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts) <image:10754>

The Palestinian flag in the viral images also displays a design error. The red triangle in the flag originates from the hoist (the vertical side attached to a flagpole) and points outward toward the fly-end. In the manipulated images, the red triangle incorrectly originates from the flag's fly-end.

A TrueMedia analysis of the images provided substantial evidence of manipulation in both instances.

### **What is Mike Tyson's stance towards the Israel-Palestine war?**

Tyson has not publicly taken a partisan stance in the Israel-Palestine conflict. He has previously been seen wearing a wristband supporting [Palestine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig6OniLkGVk&t=43s "Palestine")
 (archived [here](https://perma.cc/9VKH-ANWM "here")
) and has also spoken against [antisemitism](https://www.instagram.com/miketyson/p/CqVjDvPLmXg/ "antisemitism")
 (archived [here](https://perma.cc/GF5X-W57C "here")
). 

In November 2023, Tyson was [photographed](https://www.newsweek.com/mike-tyson-denies-link-israel-military-fundraising-fidf-1844599 "photographed")
 at a fundraising event in Miami for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). However, he later clarified that he was invited to the event as part of a casual dinner and was unaware it was a fundraiser. 

Tyson stated that he made no donations and reiterated his support for peace, saying, “As a Muslim and human, I support peace. My prayers have been and continue to be with my brothers and sisters.”

### **The verdict**

The images of Mike Tyson with a Palestinian flag before his fight with Jake Paul are fake and likely AI-generated, as evidenced by our investigation and AI detection tools.

Addis Ababa, April 2, 2025 (ENA) --- Israel is committed to strengthening economic and social ties with Ethiopia, Ambassador Abraham Negussie said.

In an exclusive interview with ENA, the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie emphasized that the current relationship between Israel and Ethiopia is grounded in practicality and modernization, with both countries actively working to strengthen their bonds.

The ambassador noted Israel's remarkable economic transformation over the past 70 years, stating the country's transition from arid landscapes to fertile fields, a strong economy, and a unified society some among others. He expressed Israel's desire to share these valuable experiences with Ethiopia.

He emphasized that the Israel-Ethiopia partnership is built on mutual interests, benefiting both nations and their people, and is especially important given the region's volatility.

Pointing out Israel’s keen interest in collaborating with Ethiopia in sectors such as agriculture, health, mining, and innovative technologies, he observed that many Israelis are already working in these vital areas to support Ethiopia's development.

“This is why so many non-governmental organizations are coming to Ethiopia to assist in agriculture, health, mining, and technology,” the ambassador added.

Ambassador Abraham further stressed that this bilateral cooperation, rooted in shared interests, has the potential to introduce modern agricultural practices, health innovations, and digital ecosystems in Ethiopia.

These efforts could drive economic reform, positioning Ethiopia as a leading nation in Africa while also benefiting Israel from the progress, according to the Ambassador.

The ambassador also emphasized the significance of economic agreements, particularly in sectors like renewable energy, water management, and irrigation systems, noting Israel’s eagerness to implement its advanced irrigation techniques in Ethiopia.

He mentioned that he has observed modern agricultural practices across the nation including Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia. 

While acknowledging the progress made, the Ambassador also recognized the need for continued improvement and strengthening the systems.

On April 2, 2025, both the Ethiopian News Agency ([Source](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848)) and Fana Media Corporation S.C. ([Source](https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/)) reported that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, expressed a commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries. <image:1>, <image:10790>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that in April and May 2025, Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia was Abraham Negussie. The Ethiopian News Agency ([Source](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848)) and Fana Media Corporation S.C. ([Source](https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/)) reported on April 2, 2025, that he was committed to strengthening ties.

The evidence does not support the claim that Ethiopia expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025. Instead, it suggests the opposite, with the ambassador actively engaged in diplomatic efforts.

Therefore, the claim is false.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

#### Europe

In late 2016, [Russia](/wiki/Russia "Russia")
 blocked the [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe")
's adoption of the IHRA-WDA.[\[123\]](#cite_note-127)
 The European Parliament called for member states to adopt the IHRA-WDA on 1 June 2017[\[124\]](#cite_note-128)
[\[121\]](#cite_note-Factsheet-125)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-129)
 – although Lerman notes that this is without explicitly quoting the examples.[\[94\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELerman2018b-98)

##### United Kingdom

In March 2016, [Eric Pickles](/wiki/Eric_Pickles "Eric Pickles")
, then [Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Communities_and_Local_Government "Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government")
, recommended the EUMC working definition of antisemitism, as used by the UK's [College of Policing](/wiki/College_of_Policing "College of Policing")
.[\[126\]](#cite_note-130)
 In October 2016, the cross-party Commons [Home Affairs Select Committee](/wiki/Home_Affairs_Select_Committee "Home Affairs Select Committee")
 published a report on antisemitism in the UK, noting that the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gave evidence describing the IHRA-WDA as "helpful, comprehensive and fit for purpose", as well as some of the criticisms of the definition. [Pro-Israel](/wiki/Pro-Israel "Pro-Israel")
 organizations have been advocates for the worldwide legal adoption of the IHRA working definition.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Penslar_2022_pp._133–145-12)

It has been described as an example of a [persuasive definition](/wiki/Persuasive_definition "Persuasive definition")
, and as a "prime example of language being both the site of, and stake in, struggles for power".[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The examples relating to Israel have been criticised by academics, including legal scholars, who say that they are often used to [weaponize antisemitism](/wiki/Weaponization_of_antisemitism "Weaponization of antisemitism")
 in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. Marcus writes that the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism used by the EUMC was based on "seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness".[\[26\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-30)
 The EUMC report concluded that anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expression could only be considered antisemitic if it was based on the stereotype of Israel as the collective Jew.[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-154-31)

Following the EUMC report, the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe")
 (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post-[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's [Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights](/wiki/Office_for_Democratic_Institutions_and_Human_Rights "Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights")
 (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 According to Marcus, the EUMC scrapped this failed definition of antisemitism, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations.[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015160-33)

### 2004 Stern, Porat and Bauer version

Israeli scholar [Dina Porat](/wiki/Dina_Porat "Dina Porat")
, then head of the [Stephen Roth Institute](/wiki/Stephen_Roth_Institute "Stephen Roth Institute")
 at [Tel Aviv University](/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University "Tel Aviv University")
, proposed the idea for a common definition of antisemitism during an NGO conference organized by the [American Jewish Committee](/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee "American Jewish Committee")
 (AJC).[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 [Kenneth S. its focus on pragmatic identification rather than scholarly understanding.[\[34\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161-38)

EUMC publication
----------------

### Initial publication

At the suggestion of the AJC, the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 The consultation involved representatives of the AJC and [European Jewish Congress](/wiki/European_Jewish_Congress "European Jewish Congress")
, the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert.[\[22\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010a-26)
 The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 According to Michael Whine of the [Community Security Trust](/wiki/Community_Security_Trust "Community Security Trust")
, the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism "played an active role in formulating the Working Definition".[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010-40)

On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published a working definition of [antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism")
 on its website that shared many features of Stern's earlier draft.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)
 Winkler published the definition "without formal review by her political overseers".[\[8\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015166–167-9)
 Marcus writes that it was a "working definition" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership, and "for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained".[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)

The stated purpose of the working definition was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism".[\[38\]](#cite_note-definition-42)
 It said:

> Antisemitism is a certain perception of [Jews](/wiki/Jews "Jews")
> , which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."[\[95\]](#cite_note-workdef-99)
 After "taking into account the overall context", the examples of what might constitute antisemitism include claims of [Jewish dual loyalty](/wiki/Antisemitic_tropes#Dual_loyalty "Antisemitic tropes")
,[\[96\]](#cite_note-100)
 and "claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor".[\[97\]](#cite_note-101)

### Adoption

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to."[\[152\]](#cite_note-156)

The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid allegations of antisemitism in the party, leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community.[\[153\]](#cite_note-157)
[\[147\]](#cite_note-Jewish_Chronicle-151)
 The UK Delegation to the IHRA said that modifying the IHRA-WDA or not including all 11 examples would mean it "is no longer the IHRA definition", would remove the consistency of having a single definition, and "undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist".[\[154\]](#cite_note-158)

In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 unamended examples to the definition of antisemitism; the IHRA-WDA was subsequently added to the party's standing orders by a majority vote of 205 by the [Parliamentary Labour Party](/wiki/Parliamentary_Labour_Party "Parliamentary Labour Party")
.[\[145\]](#cite_note-SabSep18-149)
[\[155\]](#cite_note-159)
[\[156\]](#cite_note-160)

Later in the month, a report by the [Media Reform Coalition](/w/index.php?title=Media_Reform_Coalition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Media Reform Coalition (page does not exist)")
 examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. While the announcement was welcomed by Zionist advocacy groups including [AIJAC](/wiki/AIJAC "AIJAC")
 (the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council) and the [Zionist Federation of Australia](/wiki/Zionist_Federation_of_Australia "Zionist Federation of Australia")
, the [New Israel Fund](/wiki/New_Israel_Fund "New Israel Fund")
 Australia and Australia Palestine Advocacy Network expressed concerns that the IHRA definition could be used to silence criticism of Israeli policies and actions.[\[110\]](#cite_note-Australia_2021-114)

On 10 July 2025, the first report of Australia's [Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism](/wiki/List_of_combating_antisemitism_envoys#Australia "List of combating antisemitism envoys")
[\[171\]](#cite_note-175)
[\[172\]](#cite_note-176)
 urged adoption of the IHRA working definition and its examples throughout Australian government and society "as best practice for identifying antisemitism". The report was welcomed by some Jewish organizations but criticized by others.[\[173\]](#cite_note-177)
[\[174\]](#cite_note-178)
 It was criticized in several quarters for a chilling of free speech particularly as to Israeli government policies, and a [Trumpian](/wiki/Trumpism "Trumpism")
 threat to the independence of universities and arts organisations.[\[175\]](#cite_note-179)
[\[176\]](#cite_note-180)
[\[177\]](#cite_note-181)
[\[178\]](#cite_note-182)
 Kenneth Stern, the definition's lead drafter, said that it would be a "disaster" for Australia to adopt the proposal to deal with antisemitism mainly by restricting speech.[\[179\]](#cite_note-183)
 The federal government has said that it will respond to the report after receiving a report from the special envoy on islamophobia, due in August, and a final report on racism in universities from the [Australian Human Rights Commission](/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission")
, due in October.[\[180\]](#cite_note-184)

##### New Zealand

On 24 June 2022, [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")
 formally became an observer of the IHRA.[\[181\]](#cite_note-185)
 The announcement was welcomed by the [New Zealand Jewish Council](/wiki/New_Zealand_Jewish_Council "New Zealand Jewish Council")
 and the [Holocaust Centre of New Zealand](/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_Centre_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holocaust Centre of New Zealand (page does not exist)")
 as a means of combating racism and antisemitism. In recent years, criticism of the definition has grown with critics arguing that it "primarily targets criticism of Israel and that it has been weaponized against Palestinian activists".[\[195\]](#cite_note-199)

In a statement published on 3 November 2022, 128 scholars, including leading Jewish academics at Israeli, European, United Kingdom and United States universities, said the definition has been "hijacked" and urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition due to its "divisive and polarising" effect.[\[196\]](#cite_note-200)
[\[197\]](#cite_note-201)
 As of 20 April 2023, 104 human and civil rights organisations, including [Human Rights Watch](/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch")
 and the ACLU, also urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition saying in a letter that "The IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress, non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel and/or Zionism, including in the US and Europe."[\[198\]](#cite_note-202)
[\[199\]](#cite_note-203)

Criticism of the examples
-------------------------

### Academic

In March 2005, [Brian Klug](/wiki/Brian_Klug "Brian Klug")
 argued that the definition's examples proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring [criticism of Israel](/wiki/Criticism_of_Israel "Criticism of Israel")
, and criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology into the category of antisemitism and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.[\[200\]](#cite_note-204)

In December 2016, [David Feldman](/wiki/David_Feldman_(historian) "David Feldman (historian)")
 wrote: "I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry." He also said: "The text also carries dangers. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA."[\[203\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlug2018b-207)

In August 2018, [Rebecca Ruth Gould](/wiki/Rebecca_Ruth_Gould "Rebecca Ruth Gould")
, Professor of Islamic world and comparative literature at the [University of Birmingham](/wiki/University_of_Birmingham "University of Birmingham")
, published the first extended scholarly critique of the IHRA definition: "Legal Form and Legal Legitimacy: The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism as a Case Study in Censored Speech" in the journal _[Law, Culture and the Humanities](/wiki/Law,_Culture_and_the_Humanities "Law, Culture and the Humanities")
_."

*   Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. 
*   Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. 
*   Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). 
*   Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. 
*   Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.   
    
*   Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.   
    
*   Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.   
    
*   Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.   
    
*   Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.   
    
*   Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

On 26 May 2016, the IHRA Plenary adopted its [Working Definition of Antisemitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
, which declares: 

“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” 

The definition of antisemitism was originally drafted with the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which worked with several prominent Jewish organizations to draft a comprehensive definition of antisemitism. However, in 2009 EUMC was replaced by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which decided that it would not provide a definition to any form of prejudice, including antisemitism. 

Explaining the decision, then-IHRA Chair, Romanian Ambassador Mihnea Constantinescu, [stated](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/AntiSemitism/Pages/The-IHRA-adopts-working-definition-of-antiemitism-2-June-2016.aspx)
, “All IHRA Member Countries share the concern that incidents of antisemitism are steadily rising and agree that the IHRA’s Member Countries and indeed the IHRA’s experts need political tools with which to fight this scourge. The IHRA’s 31 member countries -- 24 of which are EU member countries -- are committed to the Stockholm Declaration and thereby to fighting the evil of antisemitism through coordinated international political action.” 

The definition includes a list of eleven reference [examples](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
 to aid the identification of antisemitism. Universities, municipalities, religious groups and even sports clubs are among the bodies that have formally adopted the definition thus far. 

The UN Member States that have formally endorsed or adopted IHRA Working definition of antisemitism include:

!Ihra countries <image:10898>

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also been a strong advocate for adopting a universal definition of antisemitism, saying, “Such a definition can serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.”

[Next\

#### IHRA and Roma Genocide Remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance) Some critics of the definition have claimed that by including within its examples references to Israel, it unfairly labels detractors of Israeli policy as antisemites. Defenders of the definition argue that the wording leaves room for vigorous criticism of Israel’s government as it states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic” and that it is a non-legally binding definition, intended to guide and educate without limiting debate or free speech."

**Antisemitic acts are criminal** when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).

**Criminal acts are antisemitic** when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.

**Antisemitic discrimination** is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.

! By doing so, the IHRA provided an important practical tool for its Member Countries.

What has its impact been?

The working definition of antisemitism has brought the issue once more to the attention of leaders around the world, making them aware that much work still needs to be done to address antisemitism, which is deeply rooted in our societies.

As a result, countries and organizations have developed national and regional strategies to counter antisemitism, and have appointed Special Envoys and other advisors on the issue. [Skip to main content](#main)

In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.

On 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:

> **Adopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:**
> 
> **“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”**

To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:

Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. <image:10918>

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Why was the IHRA working definition of antisemitism developed?

The IHRA is the only intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues. Following the example of the working definition of Holocaust denial and distortion (2013), the IHRA’s experts set out to adopt a similar tool to help guide the organization’s work on combating antisemitism.

How did the IHRA adopt the working definition of antisemitism?

The experts in the IHRA’s Committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial built international consensus around a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, which was then adopted by the Plenary, the IHRA’s decision-making body made up of representatives from all IHRA Member Countries. This practical tool has also been formally adopted or endorsed\* by these groups, both at the national and organizational level.

The following international organizations have expressed support for the working definition of antisemitism:

### United Nations

*   [Secretary General Antonio Guterres](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sgsm19252.doc.htm)
     acknowledged the efforts of the IHRA Member Countries to agree on a common definition of antisemitism and underlined that it could serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.
*   [Special Rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief Ahmed Shaheed](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/ActionPlanChanges-May2022.pdf)
     recommended that governments use the IHRA working definition of antisemitism as a non-legally binding educational and training tool and ensure it is incorporated, together with relevant human rights standards-based guidance on protecting freedom of opinion and expression, into training and educational materials for all public officials, such as police, prosecutors, and judges, government employees, educators, and national human rights institutions, and integrated into diversity inclusion programs.

### European Union

*   [Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/06/fight-against-antisemitism-council-declaration/)
     and [Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P8-TA-2017-0243&language=EN&ring=B8-2017-0383)
     called on Member States that had not done so already to endorse the non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism employed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as a useful guidance tool in education and training, including for law enforcement authorities in their efforts to identify and investigate antisemitic attacks more efficiently and effectively.
*   Commission highlighted the working definition of antisemitism by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance as the benchmark for developing a victim-centered approach and urged for its adoption.

### Organization of American States

*   Secretary General Luis Almagro asked every member state to adopt the working definition and announced it would be employed to guide OAS work.

### Council of Europe

*   [European Commission against Racism and Intolerance](https://rm.coe.int/opinion-ecri-on-ihra-wd-on-antisemitism-2755-7610-7522-1/1680a091dd)

#### The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism

The IHRA is an intergovernmental agency of 35 member and nine observer countries committed to Holocaust education, remembrance, and research. State Department began using it in 2010, referring to it as the "State Department's working definition of antisemitism." The IHRA formally adopted it in 2016.

As of August 2024, the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism had been adopted by 35 states and the District of Columbia. With this knowledge in mind, it's important to note that the words "working definition" connote the possibility for change.

The IHRA definition is recognized as authoritative and used widely by governments and institutions worldwide because it was the first of its kind, is succinct, was written and approved by an international body, and was devised as a tool for education.

The definition states:

> "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Critics of the definition suggest they do not allow for legitimate criticism of Israel, its leaders, or its actions.

.

#### The Nexus Document

The Nexus Task Force is comprised of academics and clergy-including URJ professional leaders and philanthropic leaders - who came together to study the intersection (or nexus) of antisemitism, Israel, Zionism, and American politics. By codifying specific wording, we leave no space for nuance or personal understanding, hallmarks of Reform Jewish thought.

Here are five definitions of antisemitism from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), the Nexus Taskforce, the Jerusalem Declaration, T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The document suggests that it is not antisemitic to criticize Israel's current policies or the policies which led to the creation of the modern State, and that it is not inherently antisemitic to pay disproportionate attention to Israel.

#### The Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism

The Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) was written in response to the IHRA definition. As you continue to challenge antisemitism in all of its forms, we encourage you to consult any or all of the definitions shared here for guidance.

As antisemitism continues to threaten American democracy, many people - and institutions - are looking for a concise, objective definition to use in online exchanges, schools, and universities to decide if a derisive comment or chanted epithet is legally actionable.

Why is a definition needed? The group published a white paper - a document used to succinctly analyze a challenge and present solutions - in late 2020.

This definition of antisemitism was derived from the white paper.

> Antisemitism consists of anti-Jewish beliefs, attitudes, actions, or systemic conditions. JDA takes its name from the location of its sponsoring institution, the Van Leer Institute, a humanities and social science think tank.

The JDA is intended to serve as an alternative to the IHRA definition and its examples."

Content: "This deletion prompted the Israeli government and its advocates to find an alternative institutional home for their “redefinition” of antisemitism.

_IHRA definition, May 2016_

Between 2014 and 2016, the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) worked with officials from the United States, Romania, Germany, and elsewhere to secure the Working Definition’s adoption by IHRA. The SWC was a right-wing Israel lobby group with an expansive notion of antisemitism as it related to Israel: the SWC likened EU guidelines prohibiting the funding of Israeli institutions established unlawfully in Occupied Palestinian Territory to the “Nazi boycott of the Jews”; ranked UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which reaffirmed the illegality of Israel’s settlements, the world’s “Worst Anti-Semitic/Anti-Israel Incident” of 2016; and responded to an International Criminal Court determination that it had jurisdiction in Palestine by charging that “kangaroo court” with “anti-Semitism.”

The SWC’s Director of Government Affairs, Mark Weitzman, also chaired IHRA’s Committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial (“Antisemitism Committee”). Ahead of IHRA’s May 2016 meeting in Bucharest, Weitzman’s committee asked IHRA’s decision-making plenary to adopt as its own Working Definition of Antisemitism what amounted to the entire EUMC text: both the two-sentence definition and the list of eleven examples, including all four relating to Israel. Several IHRA member countries objected to the Israel-related examples as posing a threat to legitimate political speech, i.e., to valid criticism of Israel. To achieve the requisite consensus, the SWC’s proposed text was revised to exclude the examples from the Working Definition; they were retained merely as guidance for the IHRA’s own work. This revised text was adopted by consensus on 26 May 2016.

_Misrepresentation_

Israel and its advocates never valued the vague two-sentence Working Definition of Antisemitism. What they prized was the accompanying list of examples, which could be used to delegitimize criticism of Israel. By distinguishing between the definition and examples, some IHRA delegations sought to appease the pro-Israel forces that were pushing the text while preventing Israel and its supporters from using the examples to undermine freedom of speech. But beginning in 2018, Israel lobby groups began to misrepresent the examples as if they were part of the Working Definition of Antisemitism adopted by IHRA’s plenary in May 2016. IHRA’s own permanent office, based in Berlin, colluded in this falsehood. Certain IHRA member countries that had opposed the Israel-related examples privately objected to the unilateral rewriting of IHRA’s 2016 decision, but they declined to make their concerns public.

**Adoption and Implementation**

By March 2025, the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism had been endorsed by forty-four UN member states and more than half of US states; it also underpinned the EU’s antisemitism strategy. The legal or policy status of said “endorsements” was often unclear, and it was unknown how many countries had adopted the IHRA examples as well. Lara Friedman of the Foundation for Middle East Peace reported in February 2024 that there had been “a flood of complaints and lawsuits against US campuses for alleged antisemitism — virtually all relying on the IHRA definition of antisemitism.” As of March 2025, multiple initiatives to entrench or legislate the IHRA definition and/or examples were underway at both the state and federal levels.

More broadly, Israel’s formal rejection of partition in Palestine together with its plausibly genocidal conduct in Gaza from October 2023 had polarized Western public opinion and eroded Israel’s fundamental legitimacy abroad. With the second Trump administration committed to deploying the IHRA examples against “campus anti-Semitism” and pro-Israel donors pressing universities to quash student demonstrations over Gaza, controversies over the limits of permissible speech and association — with the IHRA definition as their lighting rod — look set to continue.

The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism
===========================================

Highlight

After the June 1967 War, the relationship between speech or conduct targeting the State of Israel and anti-Jewish bigotry became the subject of public controversy. Over subsequent decades, as Israel came under increasing international criticism for its diplomatic rejectionism and international law violations, a growing number of officials, campaigners, commentators, and researchers recast much of that criticism of Israel as a sinister “new antisemitism.” In 2004, an Israel advocacy group based in the United States led the drafting of a formal “redefinition” of antisemitism whose novelty was to cast certain statements criticizing Israel as antisemitic. In 2016, a version of this definition was adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), an intergovernmental body promoting Holocaust education. The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, as the text was henceforth known, became a flashpoint for debates about the relationship between antisemitism and criticism of Israel, as well as disagreements over how to mitigate “hate speech” while safeguarding academic freedom and freedom of expression.

**IHRA Definition and Examples**

In May 2016, IHRA’s decision-making plenary adopted “the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism”:

Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

The Working Definition was followed by explanatory text intended to “guide IHRA in its work.” This asserted that antisemitism may target “the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,” and caveated that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.”

The explanatory text then listed eleven “examples” of acts or expressions that “could, taking into account the overall context,” constitute antisemitism. Four of these examples related to Israel:

*   “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor”
*   “Applying double standards \[to Israel\] by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”
*   “Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis”
*   “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis”

The explanatory text also classified “antisemitic acts” as “criminal” when “so defined by law,” “criminal acts” as “antisemitic” when directed at targets selected because of a perceived “link” to Jews, and “antisemitic discrimination” as “the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others.”

Supporters of the IHRA document presented it as a “vital tool” that empowered authorities to identify antisemitic manifestations consistently and then respond accordingly. Relevant authorities were said to include judges applying hate crime laws; data collectors deciding which alleged antisemitic incidents to count; social media platforms moderating online content; university administrators regulating speech on campus; and public bodies determining which research, civil society, and cultural projects to fund.

Supporters of the definition claimed that authorities had previously failed to recognize antisemitism when it manifested as speech or action against Israel; they now could apply the IHRA definition and be guided by the examples to reach consistent assessments in hard cases. 

**Criticism**

Critics of the IHRA text argued that it was inadequate on three main grounds:

_It was indeterminate_. The two-sentence Working Definition was vague to the point of vacuity as it stipulated that antisemitism was “a certain perception of Jews” without specifying what kind of “perception.” The accompanying examples of acts or expressions that “could, taking into account the overall context,” constitute antisemitism could not be consistently applied, because the text failed to specify which “context\[s\]” should be considered as qualifying. Finally, some examples were internally ambiguous. Besides jeopardizing the right to free speech in general, the text also delegitimized speech criticizing Israel in particular. This threatened to strip the protective shield of international publicity from those targeted by Israeli policies, increasing their vulnerability to human rights violations.

Responding to these concerns, proponents of the IHRA text underscored that it was “non-legally binding” and highlighted its caveat exempting “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country.” But neither of these purported safeguards reassured the critics. For one thing, the IHRA definition had been given legal effect in certain jurisdictions (e.g., in multiple US states) and campaigners still pushed for its legal codification elsewhere. For another, even if not themselves binding, the IHRA examples could still control how judges applied hate speech laws. Furthermore, if used by university administrators, media platforms, political parties, and others to regulate speech in those domains, the IHRA examples could be non-legally binding yet still stifle expression across civil society. Meanwhile, if the question of what constituted “double standards” against Israel was subjective, it was no clearer which criticisms of Israel were “similar to that leveled against any other country.” That supposed qualification did not check or balance but merely reproduced in positive form the examples’ flaws.

**History**

The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism is the product of a concerted political campaign by Israel advocacy groups that worked with supportive governments to delegitimize as antisemitic a broad swath of international criticism of Israel.

_The new antisemitism_

In the 1970s, Israel became the subject of growing censure over its military occupation, human rights violations, and diplomatic intransigence. Israeli spokespeople and Israel supporters alleged that much or most of this proliferating international criticism was an anti-Jewish phenomenon — a “new antisemitism.” They argued that whereas traditional antisemitism had targeted Jewish individuals or communities, the new antisemitism manifested distinctively as hostility to or discrimination against the Jewish State. They further maintained that the distinction between legitimate and antisemitic criticism of Israel could be clearly delineated.

Where should that boundary be drawn? Most other participants in the drafting process also worked for Jewish organizations that advocated for Israel and endorsed claims of a new, Israel-related antisemitism. Jewish officials and antisemitism experts who had expressed skepticism toward the new antisemitism framework were excluded. The resulting text was virtually identical to the version endorsed by IHRA more than a decade later.

In 2005, the European Union Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) — an autonomous agency of the European Union (EU) — circulated a tweaked version of the AJC’s text on its website as a draft “working definition of antisemitism.” The AJC’s original document listed eleven acts or expressions that were presented as categorically antisemitic; negotiations with the EUMC added the caveat that these examples merely “could” be antisemitic depending on the “context.” That qualification was inserted to protect legitimate criticism of Israel. But in practice, Israel advocacy groups often ignored it. Neither the EUMC nor the EU endorsed the Working Definition. But Israel advocacy groups subsequently wielded what they at times construed as the “EUMC definition,” “European definition,” or even “EU definition” as a rhetorical bludgeon against Israel’s critics. The resulting controversies are what seemingly prompted the EUMC’s successor organization, the Fundamental Rights Agency, to remove the definition from its website in 2013. On the other hand, the US National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism published in May 2023 and the UN Alliance of Civilizations in January 2025 both declined to adopt the IHRA definition despite intensive lobbying by Israel supporters. _The Politics of a Definition: How the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism Is Being Misrepresented._ Free Speech on Israel, 2021. For instance, deciding whether a statement applies “double standards” to Israel will normally require that antecedent historical, political, and legal judgments be reached in respect of complex questions across highly contentious domains. Yet the IHRA text provided no guidance on how such controversies should be resolved.

_It was partisan_. The IHRA examples incorporated in a supposedly objective, technical definition of antisemitism premises that were ideologically and politically partisan. The belief that Israel or Zionism was a “racist endeavor” could be defended based on mainstream scholarship, yet one IHRA example stigmatized this position as presumptively antisemitic. Among many problems with the definition, they asserted that its adoption made it difficult to freely discuss alternative visions of the Israeli state (for example, its reconstitution as a binational polity) or the internationally recognized right of return for Palestinian refugees.

Some of these critics drafted alternative definitions that attempted to mitigate the IHRA examples’ flaws, notably the 2021 Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. Meanwhile, analogous “working definitions” of Islamophobia and Hinduphobia were developed in explicit imitation of the IHRA text."

One source, published on August 26, 2025, from [urj.org](https://urj.org/blog/five-definitions-antisemitism), mentions that the definition is a "working definition" which "connote[s] the possibility for change." The article also mentions the Nexus Document and the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, which were written in response to the IHRA definition.

Another article from [palquest.org](https://www.palquest.org/en/highlight/38757/ihra-working-definition-antisemitism) discusses the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism and its examples, noting that by March 2025, the definition had been endorsed by 44 UN member states. Neither source mentions the World Jewish Congress or any amendment to the definition in March 2025.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the IHRA definition was adopted in May 2016 and has been endorsed by numerous entities. The World Jewish Congress provides the IHRA definition on its website, but the provided evidence does not mention any amendment to the definition in March 2025, nor does it mention the assassination of JFK. The evidence also suggests that the definition is a "working definition" and can be changed.

The search results do not provide any information about the World Jewish Congress amending the IHRA definition to include the assassination of JFK. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any amendments made by the World Jewish Congress to the IHRA definition, specifically in March 2025, would be needed.

The search results show the IHRA definition was adopted in 2016 and that the definition is a "working definition" which can be changed.

A post [shared on Threads](https://www.threads.net/@cherryvondolls/post/DHZEyZZtl-7)
 claims the World Jewish Congress has purportedly amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s working definition of antisemitism to include reference to President John F. “It is now antisemitic to say Israel shot JFK,” it continues.

The post includes what appears to be a screenshot of the World Jewish Congress’ website announcing the change.

The claim is false. On March 26, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/world-jewish-congress-did-not-amend-antisemitism-definition-2025-03-26/)
 debunked the claim. Lauder, World Jewish Congress President speaks during the World Jewish Congress 2021 Theodor Herzl Award Gala at Museum of Modern Art on November 09, 2021 in New York City."

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'."

## Actions
```
web_search("World Jewish Congress IHRA antisemitism definition")
web_search("IHRA working definition of antisemitism March 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IHRA definition of antisemitism was adopted on May 26, 2016, and has been adopted by several countries and institutions. The definition includes examples of antisemitism, such as targeting the state of Israel. The World Jewish Congress website provides the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, but it does not mention the assassination of JFK. <image:k>, <image:10891>, <image:10898>, <image:10917>, <image:10918>

The provided sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHRA_definition_of_antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHRA_definition_of_antisemitism), [https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/working-definition-of-antisemitism](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/working-definition-of-antisemitism), and [https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism](https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, adopted in May 2016. One source, published on August 26, 2025, from [urj.org](https://urj.org/blog/five-definitions-antisemitism), mentions that the definition is a "working definition" which "connote[s] the possibility for change." The article also mentions the Nexus Document and the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, which were written in response to the IHRA definition.

Another article from [palquest.org](https://www.palquest.org/en/highlight/38757/ihra-working-definition-antisemitism) discusses the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism and its examples, noting that by March 2025, the definition had been endorsed by 44 UN member states. Neither source mentions the World Jewish Congress or any amendment to the definition in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IHRA definition was adopted in May 2016 and has been endorsed by numerous entities. The World Jewish Congress provides the IHRA definition on its website, but the provided evidence does not mention any amendment to the definition in March 2025, nor does it mention the assassination of JFK. The evidence also suggests that the definition is a "working definition" and can be changed.

The search results do not provide any information about the World Jewish Congress amending the IHRA definition to include the assassination of JFK. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any amendments made by the World Jewish Congress to the IHRA definition, specifically in March 2025, would be needed.

NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) reported on November 5, 2024, that Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replaced him with Israel Katz (<image:11146>, <image:11147>). The article mentions disagreements between Netanyahu and Gallant over the war in Gaza. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant)) states that Yoav Gallant was the Minister of Defense between 2022 and 2024, was dismissed by Netanyahu on November 5, 2024, and resigned from the Knesset on January 5, 2025. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Gallant on November 21, 2024 (<image:i>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive on October 1, 2024, as he made a statement about the Iranian missile attack on that date, according to The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)). Furthermore, he was fired on November 5, 2024, and resigned from the Knesset on January 5, 2025, according to NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) and Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant)).

Therefore, the claim that Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is false.

The **Majdal Shams attack**, took place on 27 July 2024, when a rocket hit a [football pitch](/wiki/Football_pitch "Football pitch")
 in [Majdal Shams](/wiki/Majdal_Shams "Majdal Shams")
 in the [Israeli-occupied](/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories "Israeli-occupied territories")
 [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
.[\[a\]](#cite_note-5)

 community[\[1\]](#cite_note-Picheta-1)
[\[2\]](#cite_note-Bulos-2)

 and injured at least 42 others,[\[5\]](#cite_note-TOI27July-6)

Early in the morning, Hezbollah took responsibility for multiple attacks including one with a Falaq-type rocket on the military headquarters of the Hermon Brigade, which was 3 km from the football pitch.[\[5\]](#cite_note-TOI27July-6)

### Analysis

The IDF stated that they had performed an assessment and concluded that Hezbollah was responsible for the rocket attack.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)
 IDF spokesman [Daniel Hagari](/wiki/Daniel_Hagari "Daniel Hagari")
 stated that the type of rocket used was an Iranian-made Falaq-1,[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)
 carrying a 50 kg [warhead](/wiki/Warhead "Warhead")
, which has previously been used by Hezbollah, the only Iranian proxy to possess it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-ynet28july-36)
 The Israeli army posted pictures of Falaq-1 shrapnel that it said was found at the scene of the attack, but with no apparent pictures of the shrapnel in situ at the blast site.[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)

A Hezbollah spokesperson, [Mohammad Afif](/wiki/Mohammad_Afif "Mohammad Afif")

 projectile launched in the course of countering Hezbollah rocket fire aiming for Israeli military sites.[\[25\]](#cite_note-TheGuardian20240728-26)
 Iranian and Qatari state media claimed there were reports that an Iron Dome interceptor was to blame.[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)

[\[41\]](#cite_note-42)
 Additionally, _[Al-Mayadeen](/wiki/Al-Mayadeen "Al-Mayadeen")
_, a Lebanese outlet with close ties to Hezbollah, stated that the blast site was inconsistent with a Falaq-1, which it said would have left a larger impact crater;[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)
 subsequent to the report, the Israeli government voted to ban _Al-Mayadeen_ from operating inside Israel.[\[42\]](#cite_note-43)

According to US intelligence, there were no doubts that Hezbollah was responsible but it was not certain if Hezbollah intentionally targeted the site or misfired.[\[29\]](#cite_note-APNews20240728-30)

Residence and paramedics rush to help children moments after a rocket attack hit a soccer field in the Druze town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan of Heights, on July 27, 2024. HASSAN SHAMS / AP

A rocket strike Saturday at a football field killed 12, children and teens, Israeli authorities said, in the deadliest strike on an Israeli target along the country's northern border since the fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began. In recent weeks, the exchange of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified, with Israeli airstrikes and rocket and drone attacks by Hezbollah striking deeper and farther away from the border.

Majdal Shams had not been among border communities ordered to evacuate as tensions rose, Israel's military said, without saying why. Israel's military said its air force targeted a Hezbollah arms depot on the border village of Kfar Kila, adding that militants were inside at the time.

Hezbollah said its fighters carried out nine different attacks using rockets and explosive drones against Israeli military posts, the last of which targeted the army command of the Haramoun Brigade in Maaleh Golani with Katyusha rockets. Video showed paramedics rushing stretchers off the football field toward waiting ambulances.

Israel's military said its analysis showed that the rocket was launched from an area north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah trading fire since Oct. On the Israeli side, 44 have been killed, at least 21 of them soldiers.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a rocket strike on a soccer field in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, on July 27, 2024, which killed 12 children and injured others. The sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)), The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/11-killed-mostly-children-dozens-more-hurt-as-rocket-hits-soccer-field-in-majdal-shams/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/11-killed-mostly-children-dozens-more-hurt-as-rocket-hits-soccer-field-in-majdal-shams/)), and Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/27/in-israel-a-rocket-strike-at-a-soccer-field-killed-at-least-11-children-and-teens_6701822_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/27/in-israel-a-rocket-strike-at-a-soccer-field-killed-at-least-11-children-and-teens_6701822_4.html)), report that Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, while Hezbollah denied responsibility. The Times of Israel article includes images of the aftermath of the attack. <image:11187>, <image:11188>, <image:11189>, <image:11193>, <image:11190>, <image:11191>, <image:11192>, <image:11200>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a rocket attack on a soccer field in Majdal Shams, Israel, on July 27, 2024, which resulted in the death of children. However, the provided images from the web search do not include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

The claim states that the image shows the youngest victim of the attack. Without further information, it is impossible to verify if the image is related to the attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a rocket strike on a soccer field in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, on July 27, 2024, which killed 12 children and injured others. The sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)), The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/11-killed-mostly-children-dozens-more-hurt-as-rocket-hits-soccer-field-in-majdal-shams/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/11-killed-mostly-children-dozens-more-hurt-as-rocket-hits-soccer-field-in-majdal-shams/)), and Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/27/in-israel-a-rocket-strike-at-a-soccer-field-killed-at-least-11-children-and-teens_6701822_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/27/in-israel-a-rocket-strike-at-a-soccer-field-killed-at-least-11-children-and-teens_6701822_4.html)), report that Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, while Hezbollah denied responsibility.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a rocket attack on a soccer field in Majdal Shams, Israel, on July 27, 2024, which resulted in the death of children. However, the provided images from the web search do not include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

The claim states that the image shows the youngest victim of the attack. Without further information, it is impossible to verify if the image is related to the attack.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[Columbia University](/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University")
 in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City")
, [New York](/wiki/New_York_(state) "New York (state)")
, has seen numerous instances of student protests, particularly beginning in the late 20th century.

1811 Riotous Commencement
-------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: 1811 Riotous Commencement")\
\]

The 1811 commencement was cancelled midway through its proceedings after graduating senior John B. He went on to lead 80,000 workers in the 1937 [Little Steel Strike](/wiki/Little_Steel_Strike "Little Steel Strike")
.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 As of 2018[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit)
, the university has not apologized for expelling him.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)

Protests of 1968
----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Protests of 1968")\
\]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Hamilton_statue_at_Columbia_University_IMG_0958.JPG/250px-Hamilton_statue_at_Columbia_University_IMG_0958.JPG)](/wiki/File:Hamilton_statue_at_Columbia_University_IMG_0958.JPG)

[Hamilton Hall](/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University) "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)")
 was occupied by protesting students in 1968

Main article: [Columbia University protests of 1968](/wiki/Columbia_University_protests_of_1968 "Columbia University protests of 1968")

Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. Students barricaded themselves inside [Low Library](/wiki/Low_Memorial_Library "Low Memorial Library")
, [Hamilton Hall](/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University) "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)")
, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)

The protests achieved two of their stated goals. A popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by [Princeton University](/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University")
 for the expansion of its athletic facilities, but as [Jadwin Gymnasium](/wiki/Jadwin_Gymnasium "Jadwin Gymnasium")
 was already 50% complete by 1966 (when the Columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
 At least 30 Columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests. The protests hurt Columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school.

Protests against racism and apartheid
-------------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Protests against racism and apartheid")\
\]

Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of [Hamilton Hall](/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University) "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)")
 and the Business School during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the [apartheid](/wiki/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era "History of South Africa in the apartheid era")
 regime in South Africa.[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
 A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa."

_“The Dismissal of Bob Burke. This became our major point of difference.”

Burke said he warned Dean Hawkes that his [expulsion would have a chilling effect on student speech](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 at Columbia: “I told the Dean that if I were expelled it would appear to the student body that this action was an attempt to frighten the ASU out of any action of significance and to frighten politically conscious students so that they would not take part in ASU affairs.”

Soon after Robert Burke led an anti-Nazi protest at Columbia in 1936, he was expelled. In 2025, history repeats itself over and over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robert Burke was a junior at Columbia University who dared to protest the administration’s ties to Nazi Germany in 1936. Butler never spoke with them](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 again.

So, Columbia students made their divestment demands known through a nonviolent protest at his home.

Robert Burke Leads Anti-Nazi Protest at Columbia President’s House
------------------------------------------------------------------

Before Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University, he was the president-elect of his junior class and a leading member of the America Student Union at the university. Heidelberg Comes to Columbia” is a 20-page document from the ACLU and other organizations that details the events at Columbia University that led up to Burke’s expulsion and its aftermath in 1936. While Oxford, Cambridge and others [rejected the invitation](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 and hoped their absence would serve as a “condemnation of Nazi attacks upon academic freedom,” Columbia University agreed to attend, setting the stage for anti-fascist protests on its campus.

Columbia Accepts Invitation to Heidelberg University
----------------------------------------------------

Columbia Assistant Secretary Philip Hayden announced on February 28, 1936 that the administration would send a representative to Heidelberg because “it is the custom of Columbia University to be represented, whenever conveniently possible, at all celebrations of educational institutions here and abroad.”

_Writer’s note: Made in collaboration with the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Student Union chapter at Columbia and the Burke Defense Committee, a 20-page document called “_[_The Dismissal of Bob Burke. Student journalists [argued that the university’s presence](https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19360302-01.2.12&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------)
 “will in effect be bestowing a benediction upon the spoliation of education and culture by the Hitler regime.”

They continued: “\[Columbia\] will be giving its approval to those who have suppressed academic freedom, perverted the content and teaching of all branches of learning, fostered a fraudulent ‘race science,’ dismissed and persecuted scholars on religious, political and racial grounds.”

Soon after Hayden’s announcement, the American Student Union (ASU) chapter voted to oppose the university’s participation and organized demonstrations against it. The article reads: “Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and other Nazi functionaries will be among the most prominent hosts to scholars and scientists who have been invited to represent the universities of the world.”

In other words, it had become clear to students that this engagement with Heidelberg University was not simply an academic courtesy, but rather a tacit endorsement of the Nazi takeover of universities and colleges.

Nearly 45 days after President Butler promised to meet with students and reconsider the invitation, [Philip Hayden told the student committee](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 that “Dr. Butler has nothing to see the committee about.”

In response to the administration’s stonewalling, Robert Burke led a group of 300 students onto South Field on the evening of May 12, 1936."

Brushing off Trump’s threat, Hamas says it will only free hostages for a lasting truce
======================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 6, 2025 12:16 PM EDT

CAIRO (AP) — Hamas on Thursday brushed off President Donald Trump’s latest threat and reiterated that it will only free the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

The militant group accused Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to back out of the ceasefire agreement they reached in January. The agreement calls for negotiations over a second phase in which the hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said the “best path to free the remaining Israeli hostages” is through negotiations on that phase, which were supposed to begin in early February. Only limited preparatory talks have been held so far.

On Wednesday, Trump [issued what he said was a “last warning” to Hamas](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/white-house-confirms-ongoing-talks-between-u-s-and-hamas-officials)
 after meeting with eight former hostages. It is also holding the bodies of 34 others who were either killed in the initial attack or in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in the 2014 war.

Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, which ended on Saturday.

Israel supports what it says is a new U.S. The Trump administration has pledged full support for Israel’s main war goals of returning all the hostages and eradicating Hamas, which may be incompatible.

Direct talks between the U.S. The White House meanwhile confirmed it had held unprecedented direct talks with the militant group, which Israel and Western countries view as a terrorist organization.

“Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. plan for the second phase
------------------------------

Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, including Israeli-American Edan Alexander. plan for the second phase in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages immediately and the rest when a permanent ceasefire is negotiated. Hamas has rejected the proposal and says it is sticking with the agreement signed in January.

Israel has cut off the delivery of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting the new arrangement."

Content: "[In December, he said there would be "all hell to pay"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62757dd55no)
 if hostages were not released by the time he took office.

The post came after Trump met with a group of hostages in the White House who had been recently released under the ceasefire.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US has been negotiating directly with Hamas to try to secure the release of the hostages.

Israel had been consulted prior to the talks, she added.

President Trump believed in doing what was in the best interest of the American people, Leavitt told reporters.

The work of the special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, work was a "good faith effort to do what's right for the American people", she added.

"Two direct meetings" have taken place between Hamas and a US official, "preceded by several communications", a Palestinian source told the BBC.

News of the talks [was first reported by Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/us-hamas-talks-gaza-war-israel)
, which said the two sides were meeting in Qatar to discuss the release of US hostages as well as a wider deal to end the war.

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

At least 48,440 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel says there are still 59 hostages being held in Gaza, with up to 24 believed to be alive.

US President Donald Trump has issued what he called a "last warning" to Hamas to release the hostages being held in Gaza.

"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say," Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform.

Hamas accused the US president of encouraging Israel to break the ceasefire deal currently in effect between the two sides.

Trump's statement came just hours after the White House confirmed it was holding direct talks with Hamas over the remaining hostages.

Washington has until now avoided direct engagement with the group, and there is a longstanding US policy against having direct contact with entities it lists as terrorist organisations.

In his social media post, Trump said there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not released, while not specifying the nature of the support he was sending Israel.

"Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you," he added.

"For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance."

He also appeared to issue a wider threat: "Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages.

Trump issues 'last warning' to Hamas as US confirms direct hostage talks

Watch: White House press secretary confirms US in talks with Hamas over hostages

A former US deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for the Middle East said the US needs to be "more proactive" about getting its citizens back.

Mick Mulroy, who is also an ex-CIA paramilitary officer, added that "it could complicate the Israelis' ability to get their citizens back if not tightly coordinated".

Israel's prime minister's office said in a statement it has "expressed its position" regarding the direct talks, but did not provide any further information.

According to reports, Boehler met with Hamas representatives in the Qatari capital, Doha, in recent weeks.

Hamas has had a base in Doha since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.

The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia.

Alongside the US and Egypt, Qatar has also played a major role in talks to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Based on the NPR article from January 7, 2025, and the BBC News article from March 6, 2025, the claim is accurate. The NPR article states that Donald Trump said "all hell will break out" if Hamas does not release hostages by the time he returns to the White House, and the BBC News article reports a "last warning" with the phrase "hell to pay".

Content: "Except courage, courage is made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — André Fran (@andrefran) [October 22, 2023](https://twitter.com/andrefran/status/1716203264440467498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While it's entirely possible that Bourdain might have agreed with the words in the quote, we have so far been unable to find any credible record of him ever having made this exact statement.

Bourdain [died by suicide](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-asia-argento-last-texts-down-and-out-in-paradise-excerpt/)
 in June 2018 in France, reportedly [hanging himself](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-death-no-evidence-foul-play-violence-report/)
 in his hotel room. We'll also take a look back at the fact that Bourdain had visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for an episode of his CNN show, which resulted in several noteworthy comments and tweets he made in regard to Palestinians.

A Quote Misattributed
---------------------

The oldest version of the quote that we could find with Bourdain's name attached to it was from July 2021.

> “Today nearly everything is made in China-except for courage, it’s made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — Rama Al Malah (@MalahRama) [July 25, 2021](https://twitter.com/MalahRama/status/1419149132053221381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Meanwhile, we found similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, showing that his name had been misattributed with the quote.

> "Today nearly everything is made in China...except for courage- it's made in Palestine." [pic.twitter.com/zdnMsjEH4g](https://t.co/zdnMsjEH4g)
> 
> — Dena Takruri (@Dena) [July 25, 2014](https://twitter.com/Dena/status/492735363417260034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

> Today almost everything is made in China!... [#psychicpowers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/psychicpowers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The episode included several key moments of narration from Bourdain that helped to shed light on what his thoughts _might_ be if he were still alive and asked about the "courage is made in Palestine" quote.

During the episode, upon entering a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza, Bourdain referred to the territory as being "a prison":

!Anthony Bourdain was purported to have said the words today nearly everything is made in China except for courage which is made in Palestine. However, as we've noted below, Bourdain did have a record of making several remarks on the subject of Israel and Gaza, including comments and tweets specifically about Palestinians.

 Clifford May, the founder and president of FDD.

Khalidi told the [_New York Post_](https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/)
, “I do not speak to the _Post_ (or the _Times_ for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late.” (The _Post_ noted it “did not offer or agree to any terms conditioning that response as off the record or on background.”

Dumisani Washington, founder and CEO of the Institute for Black Solidarity with Israel, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DumisaniTemsgen/status/1862727604458938552)
 that Biden appearing with the book suggests that the president is not a friend of Jews and Israel.

“Elections matter,” [wrote](https://twitter.com/AdamMossoff/status/1862728873093263589)
 Adam Mossoff, a law professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Never forget the gaslighting by the Biden-Harris administration over the past year, and especially by Kamala Harris who periodically dropped her mask and did reveal her true beliefs.”

**‘The double pander continues’**

In a 2020 review of the work in question in _Jewish Review of Books_, the Israeli historian Benny Morris noted that Khalidi has downplayed his PLO connection in the past.

The book “turns out to be yet another somewhat turgid recitation of the traditional Palestinian narrative, its mantras being Western and Zionist guilt for everything that has befallen the Palestinians and a passionate, personal assertion of Palestinian innocence,” Morris [wrote](https://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/7210/the-war-on-history/#)
. 

“Khalidi’s bottom line is that Zionism is a ‘colonialist’ enterprise, a doctrine enunciated in the Palestine National Charter of 1964,” he added. “It’s absolutely worthless.”

Daniel Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DanielPipes/status/1862849729689702594)
 that Biden said on Nov. 29, “Biden picks up _The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine_” by “former PLO spokesman and anti-Zionist fanatic Rashid Khalidi.”

“The double pander continues right up to Jan."

[President Biden](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden)
 on Friday picked up a copy of a book that described Israel as a colonial power in the face of Palestinian resistance despite his repeated support for the Jewish state. 

Biden was spotted by the press leaving Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017" by Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, the New York Post reported. 

"I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late," Khalidi told the Post of Biden holding his book. 

The newspaper noted it did not agree to any terms conditioning [Khalidi's response](https://www.foxnews.com/media)

In the book, Khalidi wrote about Israel's alleged discriminatory policies against Palestinians.

"Settler-colonial confrontations with indigenous peoples have only ended in one of three ways: with the elimination of full subjugation of the native population, as in North America; with the defeat and expulsion of the colonizer, as in Algeria, which is extremely rare; or with the abandonment of colonial supremacy, in the context of compromise and reconciliation, as in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ireland," he wrote.

The book argues that “the modern history of Palestine can best be understood in these terms: as a colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people against their will.”

Khalidi, who is of Palestinian and Lebanese descent, refers to President-elect Donald Trump’s first administration as a “mouthpiece” for Israel and accuses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of leading “the most extreme government” in his country’s history.

The Arab Studies academic also slams what he describes as slanted press coverage in favor of Israel.

“I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is 4 years too late,” Khalidi told The Post, which did not offer or agree to any terms conditioning that response as off the record or on background.

It was not immediately clear if Biden purchased the book or if it was given to him while in the shop — after he and first son Hunter Biden, 54, dined with first daughter Ashley Biden and other family members at the nearby Brotherhood of Thieves restaurant ahead of the island’s annual Christmas tree-lighting ceremony.

Biden has repeatedly [referred to himself as a Zionist](https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/biden-warns-public-opinion-can-shift-on-israel-as-wh-accused-of-snubbing-hostage-families-from-hanukkah-event/)

” — with some even painting the moniker on the White House gates alongside red handprints.

Khalidi writes that the “popular resistance” among Palestinians “can be expected to continue to mount.”

The author praises the First Intifada by Palestinians against Israel, which left more than 2,000 dead after nearly six years of riots and rock-throwing between 1987 and 1993, ending in the Oslo Accords that granted limited self-rule to occupied areas of the West Bank and Gaza.

“The First Intifada was an outstanding example of popular resistance against oppression and can be considered as being the first unmitigated victory for the Palestinians in the long colonial war that began in 1917,” the book says.

He has less positive words for the subsequent Second Intifada that’s better known for suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians, which resulted in a notorious security fence segregating Palestinian enclaves, writing that “the Second Intifada constituted a major setback for the Palestinian national movement.”

The Nantucket outing came just three days after Biden announced a US-brokered [cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel](https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-cease-fire-plan-in-rose-garden-address/)

Biden has increasingly criticized Netanyahu in the past year over civilian casualties in Gaza and reportedly has used expletives to describe him behind closed doors.

Khalidi’s book knocks Trump for enacting a range of policies such as moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights from Syria. With this plan, the United States ceased to be ‘Israel’s lawyer,’ becoming instead the mouthpiece of the most extreme government in Israel’s history,” wrote Khalidi.

American airline JetBlue on Sunday announced it is changing its [onboard maps](https://www.ynetnews.com/travel/article/skawilphc)
 on all carriers, to comply with U.S. guidelines for the Middle East, after Israel was labeled there as "Palestinian Territories."

In a message to Ynet, the company said its mission and values are that customers feel welcome and safe onboard. We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows."

The removal of Israel from the map angered a Jewish passenger who called out the airline but that was not the first time JetBlue was called out for possible anti-Israel bias. [In April](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry844wwz0)
, a Jewish passenger was ousted from a flight after complaining about a flight attendant wearing a "Free Palestine" pin on his uniform.

    Also – the map notations are somewhat amusing since if one insists on using the Latin term of “Palestina” for any part of that region (in English: Palestine, in Arabic: Falastin etc.), then one should indeed include what is today “Jordan” (ruled by the Hashemite family – originating from the Hejaz in today’s Saudi). Many maps refuse to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and use their old capital of Tel Aviv which hasn’t been accurate in 50 years and many countries around the world recognize a country of “Palestine” that doesn’t and has never existed – mostly based upon animosity to Jews that doesn’t much exist where Jet Blue is based in the USA. It’s not an independent country but broken up into 3 separate zones, one controlled by Israel, one controlled by Israel and subject to further negotiations, and the last which includes Gaza intended to be controlled by the Palestinian Authority – but clearly Hamas is in control of most of it in reality (until the current war which has removed them from much of the area).

‘A stern message’: how return of Trump loomed over Gaza ceasefire negotiations
==============================================================================

This article is more than 7 months old

US president-elect demanded a deal – while success against Iran and Hezbollah gave Israeli PM room to make one

The phone call from Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steven Witkoff, surprised the aides of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Calling from Doha in Qatar last Friday evening, after _Shabbat_ had already begun, Witkoff announced he was coming to Israel and would meet Netanyahu. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in July 2024. “The pressure is the essence of the matter.”

While Netanyahu has historically been able to use the threat of White House pressure as a public get out of jail free card, it is not clear – with all the risks inherent in the deal for him – that it is the case this time.

----------- Over the weekend, and into this week, the incumbent US president, Joe Biden, his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and senior figures from Egypt, Turkey and the Gulf – all mediators in the long-running negotiations – were working to put pressure on Israel and Hamas to bring the talks to a conclusion.

On Monday, Turkey’s intelligence chief, İbrahim Kalin, spoke to members of Hamas’s political bureau to apply Ankara’s own pressure.

Issues that had been sticking points for months, not least for Netanyahu, who had earlier in the year retreated from a deal he himself had promoted, suddenly were up for negotiation.

Despite the rising optimism that the sides were fast closing in on an agreement, the days since Witkoff’s meeting with Netanyahu were marked by a series of crises over the granular detail, including claims of manoeuvres until the final hours, and contradictory messaging.

By Wednesday afternoon, however, the indications were fast aligning that a deal was imminent, as Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced he was flying back to Israel from a foreign trip to be available for a vote on the deal.

Trump himself scrambled to take credit on Truth Social on Wednesday.

“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signalled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” he wrote.

“I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.”

The deal is thought to comprise a three-phase agreement – based on the framework originally laid out by Biden and endorsed by the UN security council with Netanyahu’s own buy-in (quickly reversed) in 2024.

It stipulates the release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians, in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel.

Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted militants serving life sentences. He had other fish to fry.

“What happened,” a senior Israeli government official told Channel 14, regarded as a mouthpiece for Netanyahu, “is that Witkoff delivered a stern message from the incoming president of the United States, who unequivocally demanded the deal’s conclusion.”

Writing in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth this week, Nadav Eyal summed up the situation confronting Israel’s prime minister and his closest aides. For Netanyahu, who swore to fight until a “total” – if ill-defined and unattainable – victory, the promised release of living hostages and bodies in the so-called humanitarian category of women, children and the ill brings him closer to the widely held view of most Israelis that a hostage deal should be a priority.

For Hamas, Israel’s concessions on quitting buffer zones such as the Netzarim corridor and agreeing to the return of civilians to Gaza’s north – albeit after they are screened – is closer to their own maximalist position that a comprehensive deal is possible only with the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israel’s forces. In between, however, remain a multitude of grey areas and unresolved questions.

Given the shape of the deal, one of the most pressing questions for Netanyahu is why he did not accept a similar agreement on offer as far back as May 2024.

The willingness of Netanyahu to deal at the last moment under pressure from Trump – defying far-right members of his coalition including Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich – has not been lost on Israeli commentators.

“I ask myself where did all the obstacles go?” wrote Ben Caspit in the Hebrew daily Ma’ariv. All of the obstacles that emerged at decisive moments in the negotiations, all of the statements that were issued, including several that were issued during the Sabbath, about how Israel would never leave, never stop, never surrender and never give in?”

While Netanyahu has faced a pincer movement from the incoming and outgoing US presidents, he has also seen a change in his own political circumstances that has opened the way for more flexibility.

The relative success of Israel in its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and more widely against Iran’s “axis of resistance” – even if it has not seen the anticipated return of many Israelis to the country’s north from where they have been displaced – has offered a measure of respite to be talked up.

The hard arithmetic of Netanyahu’s right-far-right coalition has also altered, not least with the return of former Likud party rival Gideon Sa’ar and his faction in September, undermining the influence of Ben Gvir and the far right.

Ben Gvir himself appeared to accept the inevitable, boasting to his constituency on X that his party had blocked a deal from being done on numerous previous occasions.

All of this has made life complicated for the Netanyahu proxies who have previously talked up the Israeli prime minister’s resolve and how friendly Trump would be to Israel.

“The pressure Trump is exerting right now is not the kind that Israel expected from him,” lamented the rightwing commentator Jacob Bardugo on Channel 14 on Monday."

CNN  — 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he had a “very warm” phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump, during which they spoke about the need for Israel’s victory in its [war on Hamas](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel)
 in Gaza and its stance on Syria.

In a video statement, Israel’s leader said he discussed a range of issues with Trump during the call on Saturday evening, including Israel’s commitment to preventing Lebanon-based Hezbollah from rearming and Israel’s conflict with Hamas, which has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza strip.

The leaders also spoke of the need to bring home the remaining hostages in Gaza, Netanyahu said.

“I discussed all of this again last night with my friend, US President-elect Donald Trump,” Netanyahu said.

“It was a very friendly, very warm and very important conversation. And I add, the less we talk about it, the better, and so with God’s help, we will succeed.”

CNN has reached out to the Trump transition team for comment.

‘No interest in confronting’ Syria
----------------------------------

Regarding Syria, where a rebel coalition overthrew the regime of President Bashar al-Assad last weekend following a lightning advance through the country, Netanyahu said that Israel had “no interest in a conflict” the country, but would adjust its policy according to the “emerging reality on the ground.”

His latest comments come after Israeli forces following Assad’s fall took control of a long-standing [buffer zone](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon-intl/index.html)
 that had separated Israeli and Syrian forces for decades – a move the rebels now in charge of Syria and some of the country’s neighbors have criticized.

Israeli officials have said the measure is temporary and Netanyahu has previously insisted Israel has “no intention” of intervening in Syria’s internal affairs.

Picture date: Sunday December 15, 2024.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01jf5dd11v81s6fjkx5dj4ymj5.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill)\

The Israeli Embassy on Shelbourne Road in Dublin, as Israel has said it will close its Dublin embassy, accusing Ireland of "crossing every red line". Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981.

Since the fall of Assad last week, the Israeli military has also taken control of Mount Hermon, which abuts the Golan Heights and lies within the buffer zone that had previously separated the two sides’ troops.

Despite Israel’s insistence the move is temporary, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab, while the rebel coalition now in charge of Syria has accused it of “crossing the lines of engagement.”

Adding to those tensions, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a plan by Netanyahu to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.

“In light of the war and the new front against Syria, and out of a desire to double the population of the Golan Heights, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today submitted for government approval the first amendment to the plan to encourage demographic growth in the Golan Heights and Katzrin Heights,” the statement said. Katzrin is an Israeli settlement in the Golan.

The plan “will assist the Golan Regional Council in absorbing the new residents who will arrive,” the statement added.

“Strengthening the Golan Heights is strengthening the state of Israel, and it is especially important at this time. We will continue to hold on to it, make it flourish, and settle it,” Netanyahu said, according to the statement.

The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration in 2019. We spoke about the need to complete Israel’s victory, and we also spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages.”

Hamas and other groups are believed to still be holding 100 hostages in Gaza, including seven Americans. All but four of the hostages were captured during Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Netanyahu said that Israel continues to “work tirelessly to bring our hostages home, both the living and the dead. Picture date: Sunday December 15, 2024.\

However, in his statement Sunday, the Israeli leader noted that Syria had “allowed Iran to arm Hezbollah through its territory” and said Israel was committed to preventing the militant group from rearming.

“This is an ongoing test for Israel, we must meet it – and we will meet it. I say to Hezbollah and Iran in no uncertain terms – to prevent you from harming us, we will continue to act against you as much as necessary, in every arena and at any time,” he said.

Israel reached a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah in November after a 13-month conflict largely fought along Israel’s border with Lebanon which saw Israel kill a string of high-ranking Hezbollah commanders."

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

American Muckrakers, a super political-action committee in the US, has asked the Department of Justice and the Department of State to investigate reports that Trump was lobbying Netanyahu and influencing US efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, Al Jazeera reported. 

The super PAC cited a report by Axios News on an alleged phone call between the former US president and Netanyahu on August 14 during which the pair discussed the ceasefire deal.

It also referred to remarks by PBS journalist Judy Woodruff who said on Monday that Trump was speaking to Netanyahu “urging him not to cut a deal right now, because it’s believed that would help the Harris campaign”.

said the alleged interactions violate the Logan Act, which bars unauthorized private US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.

Both Trump and Netanyahu, however, have denied reports of a phone call on August 14.

Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called on Netanyahu to put an immediate end to the war on Gaza, lamenting the civilian death toll.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign."

## Actions
```
web_search("Donald Trump Benjamin Netanyahu phone call August 14 2024 Gaza ceasefire")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, that Donald Trump allegedly called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal, as reported in an article by Jordan King. The American Muckrackers PAC accused Trump of violating the Logan Act. Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. ([https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)) <image:11382>

The Guardian published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing the impact of Donald Trump's return on Gaza ceasefire negotiations, mentioning a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Benjamin Netanyahu. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/a-stern-message-how-return-of-trump-loomed-over-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/a-stern-message-how-return-of-trump-loomed-over-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations)) <image:11388> CNN reported that Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Donald Trump on December 15, 2024, to discuss the war on Hamas in Gaza. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-call-gaza-syria-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-call-gaza-syria-intl-latam)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests conflicting information regarding the claim. Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, about an alleged phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a ceasefire deal, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The Guardian mentioned a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Netanyahu, but it does not specify the date or the content of the call. CNN reported a call on December 15, 2024, but it does not mention the content of the call.

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

Former US President and current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is facing controversy over alleged attempts to solicit foreign influence in the upcoming elections in November.

This comes amidst a severe [humanitarian crisis in Gaza](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/18/besieged-gazans-share-shoes-wear-same-clothes-for-months)
, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed, injured, or displaced due to the ongoing Israeli bombing campaign since the war broke out on Oct 7, 2023.

According to US media reports, the former President [reportedly spoke](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)
 with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging him to reject a ceasefire deal in Gaza over concerns that it could benefit his Democratic rival and Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.

Veteran journalist and _PBS NewsHour_ host Judy Woodruff said on her show: "The reporting is that former President Trump is on the phone with the Prime Minister of Israel, urging him not to cut a deal right now, because it’s believed it would help the Harris campaign."

It is unclear whether Woodruff was referring to a new report or referencing last week's reports about Trump's alleged conversation with the Israeli PM, which coincided with the subsequent collapse of ceasefire talks on Sunday.

The collapse occurred after Hamas rejected the latest US proposal, [blaming Netanyahu](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/18/hamas-rejects-us-ceasefire-hostage-proposal)
 for altering the terms.

"After being briefed by the mediators about what happened in the last round of talks in Doha, we once again came to the conclusion that Netanyahu is still putting obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement, and is setting new conditions and demands with the aim of undermining the mediators' efforts and prolonging the war," Hamas said in a statement, according to _Axios_.

Notably, senior Israeli officials [told](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/19/netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands)
 _[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/19/netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands)
_ that the Israeli leader had endorsed the US proposal, knowing that Hamas would reject it.

Last week, another _[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/15/trump-netanyahu-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-call)
_ [report](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/15/trump-netanyahu-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-call)
 revealed that Trump had spoken with Netanyahu on August 14, a day before the ceasefire talks. The killing has to stop." [pic.twitter.com/fPrmGbH25J](https://t.co/fPrmGbH25J)

If confirmed, Trump's actions could potentially violate the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorised US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments to influence their actions or policies.

Meanwhile, political watchdog and investigative journalism group _American Muckrakers PAC_ [filed a request](https://x.com/AmericanMuck/status/1826089810999509462)
 with the DOJ and State Department on Tuesday to investigate Trump's potential Logan Act violation, citing news reports of his calls with the Israeli leader.

However, the application of the Logan Act has been rare and challenging, with few prosecutions or convictions historically.

The former US President and his campaign associates have a history of attempting to coerce foreign powers for electoral gains.

Russian state actors, reportedly under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, influenced the 2016 US presidential election, with four major investigations confirming these findings.

Among them, a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a bipartisan Senate report concluded that the Trump campaign [welcomed foreign assistance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/17/truth-about-russia-trump-2016-election/)
, violating established US election laws. Several individuals associated with the Trump campaign [were convicted or indicted](https://time.com/5556331/mueller-investigation-indictments-guilty-pleas/)
 in connection with the Russia investigation, led by Mueller.

And in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Trump was [caught pressuring](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49800181)
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son while withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine, a move that ultimately led to the first of his two impeachments.

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides more details about the claim. Both the Tehran Times and The New Indian Express reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, citing a phone call on August 14, 2024. However, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call.

The claim is supported by reports from multiple news sources, which state that Trump's alleged motivation was to hinder Kamala Harris' campaign. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.

The claim's veracity is **unclear** due to conflicting reports and denials from the involved parties.

Content: "Vice President Kamala Harris walks to board Air Force Two at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, US, July 22, 2024.

Erin Schaff/Pool/Reuters

CNN  — 

Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s [address to Congress](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html)
 on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left.

An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris’ aide cited a previously scheduled event as the reason for missing the speech Wednesday.

A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden’s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister.

The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris’ first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and [endorsed Harris’ candidacy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination/index.html)
.

Harris is expected to “continue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,” the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas’ attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“We anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,” according to the aide.

U.S. “And they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.”

On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority’s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters.

“Her travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,” the aide said.

Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu’s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson.

Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu’s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN.

Netanyahu landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a [post by an Israeli Embassy official on X.](https://x.com/EliavBenjamin/status/1815484694902837408)
 He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza – including Americans – on Monday evening.

Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by his wife, are interviewed before the departure for Washington, Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel, July 22, 2024. — Amos ben Gershom/GPO

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to arrive to Washington on Monday and meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday, a day before the Israeli leader is due to address a joint session of Congress.

After Biden announced his intention to withdraw from the presidential race and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, Netanyahu refrained from wading into US electoral politics. The Israeli prime minister who is known to favor Republican nominees said Monday he will seek the continuation of American bipartisan [support of Israel](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/biden-approaches-red-line-netanyahu-7-months-gaza-war)
 and pledged to preserve Israel’s friendship and partnership with the United States no matter who wins the next election.

Speaking with reporters before taking off for Washington, Netanyahu said he intended to reaffirm to the United States — "to our friends in both political camps" — that "regardless of who the American people choose as their next president, Israel remains its most indispensable and strongest ally in the Middle East."

**Harris to the left of Biden**

Apart from Biden, and a possible, not-yet-confirmed meeting with former President Donald Trump, Netanyahu is also set to meet with Vice President and presidential front-runner Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

Harris is seen to the left of Biden on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reuters said Monday that Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policies, but could adopt a harsher tone with Israel over the Gaza war, if elected president.

Sidelining his disagreements with Biden, Netanyahu said that in addition to addressing Congress July 24, he is also set to meet with the American president "whom I have known for over 40 years." Netanyahu said, "This \[the meeting\] will be an opportunity to thank him for the things he did for Israel in the war and during his long and distinguished career in public service, as senator, vice president and president. In this time of war and uncertainty, it is of the outmost importance for our enemies to know that the United States and Israel are standing together — today, tomorrow and always."

Netanyahu’s visit to Washington will be his first since establishing his government in December 2022, and in fact the first in almost four years. Still, Schumer eventually joined the initiative of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite Netanyahu to address a joint session, making the Israeli premier one of the only world leaders to deliver his fourth speech to Congress.

The invitation letter for Netanyahu — signed by Johnson, Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — said, “To build on our enduring relationship and to highlight America’s solidarity with Israel, we invite you to share the Israeli government’s vision for defending democracy, \[combating\] terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.”

Washington police said they were expecting a large number of demonstrators outside Congress on Wednesday, protesting against Netanyahu and the [Gaza war](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/israels-netanyahu-gambles-gaza-cease-fire-new-conditions)
, and were making additional security arrangements. He said that this would mean that Netanyahu should expect a complicated meeting with the president, who will insist on reaching soon a plan for the liberation of the hostages and a Gaza cease-fire.

US Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff descend from Air Force Two at Delaware National Air Guard base in New Castle, Delaware, on July 22, 2024. "She will have to somewhat distance herself from Biden, but she is going to keep it very minimal," as Israel is not a key issue in the American presidential elections where immigration and inflation will dominate.

Considered to the left of President Joe Biden on the Gaza war and Israeli policy, Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/gaza-iran-what-kamala-harris-middle-east-policy-could-look)
 is expected to adopt a slightly more critical approach of Israel's military conduct when she likely becomes the Democratic nominee for president — and an even harsher approach if she wins the election, experts tell Al-Monitor. 

"We don’t know enough," Ziegler Distinguished Fellow at The Washington Institute David Makovsky, who served on the US negotiating team during the 2013-2014 Israeli-Palestinian talks, told Al-Monitor. A White House readout after the meeting said Harris "raised the need to increase stability and security in the West Bank and hold extremist settlers accountable for violent acts." The Biden administration has imposed [sanctions](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/extremist-west-bank-settlers-outposts-hit-us-sanctions)
 on several individuals and entities accused of committing violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. 

**Obama redux?**

Israeli and American experts warn it is too soon to have a clear picture on the policy Harris will espouse on Israel in general and on the Gaza war in particular, as she has not yet officially received the nomination as the Democratic Party candidate. On the other hand, she has been quite outspoken about Palestinian suffering in Gaza."

In making his assessment, Makovsky drew on the speech Harris delivered in Dubai last December, when she said that Israel "must do more to protect civilian life \[in Gaza\]." Reaffirming the Biden administration's stance that Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas after the Gaza-based group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, Harris also expressed concerns about widespread Palestinian suffering and warned that "international humanitarian law must be respected."

Contrary to high-ranking members of the Biden foreign policy and defense team, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Biden himself, among others, Harris has not traveled to Israel since Oct. While Biden has had dealings with Netanyahu for four decades and touts their close relationship despite its obvious souring in recent months, Harris has met the Israeli premier only a handful of times. 

**Harris on the Gaza war**

Addressing the Munich Security Conference in February, Harris said that Hamas had used rape of Israeli women as a weapon of war, but she added that "we have also been clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, that Israel must do better to protect innocent civilians." On that occasion, Harris also called on Israelis and Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table, noting that "there cannot be, in my opinion, peace and security for that region — for the people of Israel or the Palestinians and the people of Gaza — without a two-state solution."

Harris’ call to protect the lives of Gaza civilians did not markedly differ from statements made by Biden. Still, contrary to Biden, in a July 8 interview with The Nation, Harris went into greater detail on the suffering of Gazans. I’m hearing stories about their eating animal feed, grass … so that’s how I think about it," The Nation quoted Harris as saying. 

Meanwhile, Harris' aides indicated Monday that the vice president will not preside over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday due to previously planned travel. Harris referred to the issue of West Bank settlement and extremist settlers in her meeting in Washington last November with Israeli President Isaac Herzog."

The evidence mentions Harris's "unwavering commitment to Israel" and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself, but not the specific phrase "Our support for Israel will continue."

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

FACT CHECK: Did Kamala Harris Say 'Our Support for Israel Will Continue?'
=========================================================================

As of now no evidence has been found of Harris using those words during Netanyahu's visit or at any other time in recent months.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   By [R. She was scheduled to meet with Netanyahu separately on July 25, 2024.

According to an anonymous aide quoted by The Wall Street Journal, Harris was expected to urge Netanyahu to end the conflict in a manner that ensures Israel's security, guarantees the release of all hostages, alleviates the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and allows the Palestinian people to attain their rights to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.

Although she has been vocally supportive of Israel, Harris was the first in the Biden administration to advocate for a temporary cease-fire in a speech given in March 2024. According to a post on X, Harris allegedly reinforced her ties with Israel by saying, "Our support for Israel will continue."

The post garnered over 9 million views and was shared more than 4,000 times. Ghosh](/reporters/r-ghosh)

Earlier this week, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the United States during Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza, a supposed quote from Vice President Kamala Harris gained widespread attention. She did not attend Netanyahu's address to Congress on July 24, 2024, due to other commitments, although she planned to meet with him during his visit.

However, Harris has supported Israel during its military operations in Gaza, while also advocating for a cease-fire and increased humanitarian aid. She also emphasized the need for increased humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Amid uncertainty regarding her position on Israel, Doug Emhoff, Harris' husband, participated in a Zoom call on July 24 organized by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala. She has consistently supported Israel during its assault on Gaza and also became the first person in the Biden administration to call for a temporary cease-fire but the claim made in the viral post is completely false.

**No Concrete Evidence**

Kamala Harris Twitter

As of now no evidence has been found of Harris using those words during Netanyahu's visit or at any other time in recent months. Therefore, this claim can be rated "False."

The latest statement Harris made regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict condemned pro-Palestine protesters in Washington, D.C., for burning American flags.

On July 24, 2024, many demonstrators gathered to criticize Netanyahu after his congressional speech and to call for an end to the war in Gaza, where Israeli military operations have killed over 39,000 Palestinians.

Harris' statement read: "I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. President Joe Biden has been vocally pro-Israel even before the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, many analysts suggest that Harris may be shifting her stance over time.

Harris faced criticism from Republicans for missing Netanyahu's speech to attend a previously scheduled event with a historically Black sorority in Indianapolis."

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations of targeting civilians, saying it abides by international law and has a right to defend itself after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.

Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Some 83% of Gaza’s population are residing in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone,” according to IDF assessments in July.

The zone is located in the al-Mawasi area on the southern Strip’s coast, western neighborhoods of Khan Younis, and central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. Israel says it has killed some 18,000 combatants in battle as of November, 2024, and another 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.

According to the PCBS, the population of Gaza has declined by about 160,000 during the course of the war to 2.1 million, with more than a million or 47% of the total under the age of 18. The data presented by the body this week claimed that there were approximately 60,000 pregnant women currently in the Strip, which would mean an increase in births despite the overall decline in population and ongoing grueling war.

The PCBS said some 22% of Gaza’s population currently faces catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, according to the criteria of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global monitor.

Included in that 22% are some 3,500 children at risk of death due to malnutrition and lack of food, the bureau said.

It added that Israel has “raged a brutal aggression against Gaza targeting all kinds of life there; humans, buildings and vital infrastructure… entire families were erased from the civil register. (Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)

The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Around 45,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, have been killed since the war began and another 11,000 are missing, the bureau said, citing numbers from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

The Hamas figures cannot be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and fighters. <image:11497>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source, an article by the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% *decrease* in Gaza's population since the war began on the same date, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

The discrepancy could be due to different methodologies, data sources, or the time frame considered. The NYCFPA article's reliance on pre-war growth forecasts might not account for the impact of the conflict. The CNN and Times of Israel reports, citing the PCBS, appear to reflect actual population changes during the war, including migration and casualties.

Therefore, the claim is likely false, as the more recent reports indicate a population decrease, not an increase.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. [Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/) <image:11471>

CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with about 100,000 Palestinians leaving Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks. [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The Times of Israel also reports a 6% decline in Gaza's population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/) <image:11497>


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source, an article by the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% *decrease* in Gaza's population since the war began on the same date, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

The discrepancy could be due to different methodologies, data sources, or the time frame considered. The NYCFPA article's reliance on pre-war growth forecasts might not account for the impact of the conflict. The CNN and Times of Israel reports, citing the PCBS, appear to reflect actual population changes during the war, including migration and casualties.

Therefore, the claim is likely false, as the more recent reports indicate a population decrease, not an increase.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information. While one source claims a 2.02% increase in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, based on pre-war forecasts, other sources report a 6% decrease during the same period, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. The latter reports appear to reflect actual population changes during the war.

The latter reports reflect actual population changes during the war.

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing.

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Tsafrir Abayov/AP

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

  !People inspect the damage at the site of an overnight Israeli airstrike that targeted a branch of the Al-Qard Al-Hassan finance group in Beirut's southern suburbs on Monday. <image:11584>](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/1233941853/israel-hezbollah-beirut-lebanon-explosion-hassan-nasrallah)

### [Middle East conflict](https://www.npr.org/series/1205445976/middle-east-crisis)

### [What is Hezbollah, the militia fighting Israel in Lebanon?](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/1233941853/israel-hezbollah-beirut-lebanon-explosion-hassan-nasrallah)

A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to detail attack plans before they were carried out, on Sunday told reporters that Israel planned the strikes throughout Lebanon against several of the institution's branches that act like banks to help fund Hezbollah — what the official termed the organization's "economic strongholds."

But the official also acknowledged that while Al-Qard Al-Hassan is used in part to pay Hezbollah fighters and purchase weapons, it has also served hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians — the majority drawn from the country's Shia Muslim communities — who simply used the system for their own banking needs. Lebanon is assessing the damage.

Late Sunday an Israeli military spokesperson published messages online in Arabic instructing Lebanese civilians to move away from specific buildings that house branches of the bank, called Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

While United Nations representatives said the warnings sparked panic in parts of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, Israel's foreign minister [said 15 buildings](https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1848239028304240663)
 were struck and its military would continue to attack Hezbollah.

The U.S. And in the city of Tyre, the agency reported that "severe damage to surrounding homes" and to a nearby radio station had resulted from the strike on one branch.

Across Lebanon on Saturday, the country's Health Ministry recorded 16 people killed and 59 wounded people, many of them in the country's south close to Israel's border — bringing the total death toll since the start of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah last October to 2,464.

In northern Israel, the Israeli government's latest figures show a total of 59 people killed and 569 injured over the same period.

TEL AVIV, Israel, and BEIRUT — Israel's military carried out [airstrikes overnight](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)
 on targets in Lebanon that the military says are linked to a financial institution that undergirds the militant group Hezbollah. "We tell the depositors in Al-Qard Al-Hassan that you will not lose a single penny," he told local media, in an interview later shared [in part on Telegram](https://t.me/almayadeen/269486)
.

Israeli military warnings on social media before the strikes informed the residents of specific buildings in southern Beirut and the Bekaa Valley that they were "located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah." Those inside the highlighted buildings were told to evacuate immediately and remain at least 500 meters (547 yards) away from them "for your safety and the safety of your family members."

Some [Lebanese news outlets and social media posts](https://x.com/ALJADEEDNEWS/status/1848078370812170495?mx=2)
 subsequently suggested that a hospital in the town of Baalbek had been evacuated due to its proximity to a strike on one Al-Qard Al-Hassan branch. But in a [statement Lebanon's health ministry denied that](https://www.mtv.com.lb/en/News/Local/1504621/health-ministry-clarification--baalbek-governmental-hospital-transferred-patients-to-safer-rooms)
, and said the hospital was operating normally. "Hezbollah has paid and will continue to pay a heavy price for its attacks on northern Israel and its rocket fire."

Hezbollah is partially financed and significantly supported by the government of Iran, and Katz said Israeli forces would "keep striking the Iranian proxy until it collapses."

Precise details of fatalities and injuries tied to the strikes overnight into Monday have not yet been confirmed. But ahead of his arrival in the Lebanese capital, Israel's military had announced fresh ground raids in southern Lebanon, killing fighters and dismantling anti-tank missiles, RPG launchers and other explosives, according to an Israeli military statement. Two dozen missiles crossed the border from Lebanon into northern Israel Monday morning after around 200 did so on Sunday, according to the Israeli military.

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[95\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-101)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[96\]](#cite_note-aj-102)

### Previous Israeli raids

On 1 October, the IDF revealed that its special forces had carried out more than 70 small covert raids into southern Lebanon since November 2023, but had not clashed with Hezbollah fighters during these raids.[\[137\]](#cite_note-143)
 The IDF said it had uncovered Hezbollah tunnels, weaponry, and invasion plans in villages near the border, including [Ayta ash-Shaab](/wiki/Ayta_ash-Shaab "Ayta ash-Shaab")
, [Mais al-Jabal](/wiki/Mais_al-Jabal "Mais al-Jabal")
 and [Kfar Kila](/wiki/Kfar_Kila,_Marjayoun "Kfar Kila, Marjayoun")
.[\[138\]](#cite_note-jpost_1oct-144)
 IDF Spokesman [Daniel Hagari](/wiki/Daniel_Hagari "Daniel Hagari")
 said they found Hezbollah plans to launch an attack similar to Hamas' [7 October attacks](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
, which sparked the conflict.[\[86\]](#cite_note-reuters20240930-92)
 Hagari also mentioned that evidence from these operations, including videos and maps, would be presented to the international community. Two hours later, the IDF fired rounds into the camp that caused smoke to rise, injuring 15 UNIFIL peacekeepers due to skin irritations and [gastrointestinal](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract "Gastrointestinal tract")
 reactions.[\[74\]](#cite_note-bbc20241013-79)
 A report by one of the countries providing troops to UNIFIL said that the smoke was suspected to be [white phosphorus](/wiki/White_phosphorus "White phosphorus")
, the use of which is unlawful in populated areas under international law.[\[280\]](#cite_note-286)

In recent days, residents across central Israel have reported hearing loud nighttime explosions, likely stemming from [IDF operations in Gaza](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1niijygxg)
.

Ynet received dozens of emails from residents describing what sounded like distant blasts. While the IDF has not yet commented, a physicist explained why such explosions can sometimes be heard dozens of kilometers away.

IDF strikes in Gaza

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the [Davidson Institute of Science Education](https://www.ynetnews.com/topics/Davidson_Institute_of_Science)
, told Ynet that weather plays a key role in how sound travels. “When the air gets warmer closer to the ground—usually because the sun heats the surface—sound waves can bend upward, away from our ears, weakening the noise we hear,” he said.

Conversely, during the night, the ground cools faster than the air above it, reversing the effect. “This is one reason why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night,” Rosenberg noted.

He also explained the physics behind the sound of rocket blasts over the sea. “When a rocket explodes, it produces a shock wave with a sudden and intense air pressure change,” he said. “Close to the blast, this wave can be deadly or cause serious damage—especially in the sea, where it can harm marine life.”

As the shock wave travels, it loses energy by heating the air and interacting with objects. Eventually, it breaks apart into the sound waves we hear. “It’s like a huge wave at sea that collapses into smaller ones,” Rosenberg said.

#### TAKE ACTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

WE MUST END GENOCIDE IN GAZA
============================

Palestinians in Gaza are **facing mass starvation.** The Israeli military is blocking aid, bombing shelters, and turning food, water, and medicine into weapons of war.

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to send billions in weapons to the Israeli government — despite clear evidence they’re being used to commit war crimes.

Amnesty has repeatedly documented U.S.-made weapons in unlawful attacks on civilians. **U.S. leaders risk complicity in genocide.**

**Act now:** Tell Congress to stop arming this crisis, demand a permanent ceasefire, and help facilitate the unhindered entry and distribution of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Hello, I write to you as a member of Amnesty International USA with deep concern over the ongoing violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. I am also deeply worried about President Trump's dangerous threats to forcibly deport around 2 million Palestinians and "take over" the occupied Gaza Strip – as they are not just outrageous and shameful, but if enacted, would amount to a war crime. The U.S. government is uniquely positioned to have tremendous impact in this conflict to ensure the protection of civilians and prevent further suffering. Since the Hamas-led attacks and atrocities on October 7, we have witnessed horror unfolding on an unimaginable scale in the occupied Gaza Strip. More than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to survive amidst a human-made humanitarian catastrophe, and the level of civilian casualties has been unprecedented. Amnesty International's new research report, published on December 5 and titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel's Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza,' concludes that the Israeli government has committed and is continuing to commit genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Even with the ceasefire, the Israeli authorities continue to inflict conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, a prohibited act of genocide. I am urging you to immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply, sale, or transfer to the Israeli government of all weapons, munitions, and other military and security equipment that would more likely than not be used in the violation of international humanitarian and human rights law, consistent with the United States’ own laws and its obligations under the Genocide Convention. Governments – including and especially the United States’ – that continue to transfer arms to Israel at this time must know they are violating their obligation to prevent genocide and are at risk of becoming complicit in genocide. To protect civilians, I am also urging you to ensure that the ceasefire becomes permanent and that desperately needed humanitarian aid and reconstruction is not used as a means to coerce Palestinians into leaving Gaza. Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes and be provided dignified temporary housing until reconstruction is completed. Remaining hostages and arbitrarily detained Palestinians must also be released. Sincerely, {user\_data~First Name} {user\_data~Last Name}

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) reports on the ongoing conflict, including an Israeli attack in Beirut on October 21, 2024, and an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) reports on Israeli airstrikes on financial institutions linked to Hezbollah on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and the resulting conflict. <image:10230>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) confirms that there was an Israeli attack in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) also supports this, reporting on Israeli airstrikes on the same date.

The evidence supports the claim that there was an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific attack.

I need more information to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

An Israeli missile hits a building in Ghobeiry, Beirut. Another captured it a fragment of a second before it smashed through a lower-floor balcony.

In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outwards as the building collapsed.

The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate the area. \[Bilal Hussein/AP Photo\]

Published On 23 Oct 202423 Oct 2024

Taking cover behind a large tree, a photographer from The Associated Press news agency pointed his camera towards an apartment building in Beirut that the Israeli military warned was in its sights.

When a missile plunged from the sky moments later, the photojournalist and his lens were perfectly positioned to document the trail of destruction – second by second, frame by frame.

“I heard the sound of the missile whistling, headed toward the building and then I started filming,” photographer Bilal Hussein said on Tuesday, hours after Israeli forces launched the attack. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare.

The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital that they should evacuate the area.

He did not explain why the buildings were being targeted, other than to say they were near “interests and facilities” associated with the Hezbollah group.

The warning prompted many people to flee the busy, densely populated neighbourhood, even as others, including a few journalists, kept watch."

Images capture the exact moments an Israeli bomb strikes a building in Beirut
=============================================================================

             ![CAPTION CORRECTS TYPE OF MUNITION A bomb dropped from an Israeli jet hits a building in Ghobeiri, Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outward as the building collapsed.

A bomb dropped from an Israeli jet hits a building in Ghobeiri, Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare.

The strike Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on [Beirut’s southern outskirts](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-strike-hospital-israel-rescue-survivors-rubble-da09186fc06d734e0457e6c099f3d992)
 that that they should evacuate the area.

Even before the ground invasion, months of rocket strikes had damaged Yaroun, this satellite imagery from the summer shows.

But the new satellite imagery shows fresh destruction since the invasion, with a whole section of Yaroun flattened after Israeli military vehicles razed the area.

After a week of shelling, strikes and clearing, there are more visibly destroyed buildings than previously seen. 5

Maroun al-Ras has seen fighting before: It was the scene of a major battle during Israel’s 2006 invasion of Lebanon. Scores of homes leveled, a damaged health clinic and a centuries-old mosque now little more than rubble — toppled, a video suggests, in what appears to be a controlled explosion by the Israeli military.

These are some of the first glimpses to emerge from southern Lebanon, a week after Israel began its ground invasion there as part of its multipronged fight against Hezbollah. So are newly constructed banks of earth where the Israeli military set up positions for tanks and other military vehicles.

Over the past week, the Israeli military has flattened large parts of two border villages: Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun, seen in the video above that was filmed by the Israeli military and verified by The Times.

Hezbollah has been launching rockets aimed at Israel from southern Lebanon since last October in solidarity with Hamas. Hezbollah says it has targeted Israeli troops in both Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun with rocket barrages.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) reports on the ongoing conflict, including an Israeli attack in Beirut on October 21, 2024, and an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) reports on Israeli airstrikes on financial institutions linked to Hezbollah on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and the resulting conflict. <image:10230>


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10230>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) confirms that there was an Israeli attack in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) also supports this, reporting on Israeli airstrikes on the same date.

The evidence supports the claim that there was an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific attack.

I need more information to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 23, 2024, with images of an Israeli missile strike on a building in Beirut on October 22, 2024 (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>, <image:7>, <image:8>). The AP News article, published on October 22, 2024, features images of an Israeli airstrike on a building in Ghobeiri, Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday, October 22, 2024. The New York Times published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing the destruction in Lebanon, including satellite imagery from Planet Labs, dated October 28, 2024. The image <image:10230>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were Israeli attacks in Lebanon on October 21 and 22, 2024. However, the search results do not provide any information to confirm whether the image depicts an attack on October 21, 2024. The image could depict the attack on October 22, 2024, but this cannot be confirmed.

I need more information to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 and other [communications devices](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-second-wave-tech-pager-explosions-beirut-nabatieh-tyre-saida/)

Content: "Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis.

Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new type of weapon the group had not used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, “in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.”

In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding around 3,000.

!Israeli security and rescue forces work at the site hit by a rocket fired from Lebanon, in Kiryat Bialik, northern Israel, on Sunday, Sept. 22, 2024. 22, 2024.

Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions.

The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explod e just days earlier.

**Related:** [The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers.](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120538/israel-airstrike-beirut-lebanon-hezbollah)

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. 22, 2024. 22, 2024.

Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired “toward civilian areas," pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct."

Visual forensic analysis suggests that the widely circulated image of the alleged Ramat David Airbase attack is likely AI-generated.

Image: The image is claimed to be from a missile attack on Ramat David Airbase in Israel by Hezbollah.

An image circulating on various platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and Telegram, claims to show the aftermath of an alleged [missile attack](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)
 on Ramat David Airbase in Israel by Hezbollah on 22 September 2024. (See figure 2)

### Comparison to known incidents and visual evidence

The [Ramat David Airbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_David_Airbase)
 has been a significant target in previous conflicts, such as during the [Second Lebanon War](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/operation-gift)
 and, more recently, in 2024, amidst intensified conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.

Historically, images of the aftermath of attacks on military installations often display recognisable and identifiable military hardware. In contrast, this image presents vehicles that do not match any known military transport or logistical [vehicles used by Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Israel_Defense_Forces)
, the US, or any other military force worldwide.

Additionally, while it is reported that Hezbollah [launched](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)
 missiles at Ramat David on 22 September 2024, no credible visual evidence from trusted news outlets has confirmed the authenticity of the specific image in question. This channel and others play a significant role in circulating unverified or manipulated content, often blurring the line between authentic news and false narratives.

Lastly, upon a detailed visual forensic analysis of the image, it is highly likely that the image showing the aftermath of a supposed missile strike on Ramat David Airbase is AI-generated or significantly manipulated.

The following factors support this conclusion:

*   Unrecognisable vehicles that do not correspond with any existing military models.
*   Blurry and unreadable text on vehicles is typical of AI-generated images.
*   Inconsistent lighting and shadows that do not reflect the real-world impact of a large fire.
*   Symmetrical and uniform flames that lack the chaotic nature of real-world explosions.
*   A blurry background with unnatural transitions between foreground and distant elements.

The reported missile strike by Hezbollah on 22 September 2024 is a real event, but this image does not appear to be an accurate representation of that attack.

I do OSINT research, investigations, and analysis with a love for data visualisation and geospatial magic. The shapes and textures of these vehicles appear artificial, with distorted or unclear outlines that make it difficult to identify any specific model used by military forces around the world.

Typically, airbases, particularly one as strategic as Ramat David, house well-documented vehicle types, including fuel trucks, maintenance vehicles, and armoured transport. In this image, however, none of the vehicles can be compared to existing models, which raises suspicion about the image’s authenticity. A thorough analysis reveals that the image, widely shared on social media platforms, appears to be AI-generated or manipulated for the following reasons.

Figure 1: Social media accounts amplify the AI-generated image with thousands of impressions on X and Reddit.

Visual forensic analysis
------------------------

*   _Vehicles appear unrecognisable_

A significant red flag in the image is the unrecognisability of the vehicles shown. (See figure 2)

*   _Blurry text on vehicles_

One of the most prominent signs of AI-generated imagery is blurry or indecipherable text. This is a hallmark of AI manipulation, as text is often poorly rendered in AI-generated images."

POLITICO.EU ([https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)) also reported that Hezbollah launched rockets at the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024.

The Associated Press (NPR) ([https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/22/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says/](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/22/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says/)) reported that Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel, including the Ramat David airbase.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

 circulating on social media. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic."

POLITICO.EU ([https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)) also reported that Hezbollah launched rockets at the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024.

The Associated Press (NPR) ([https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/22/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says/](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/22/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says/)) reported that Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel, including the Ramat David airbase. The image <image:10243>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the provided search results do not contain any information about the authenticity of the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine whether the image is authentic. This could be done by comparing the image to other images of the Ramat David airbase or by checking if any news outlets have reported on the image.

Content: "<image:12095>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:12096>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:12095>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:12098>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Content: "(Noam Lehmann/Times of Israel)

About 300 people are marching from Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to the IDF headquarters on Begin Street to demand a ceasefire deal in Gaza to free hostages, kicking off a fifth straight night of protests after the IDF said Sunday it had recovered the bodies of six Israelis in Hamas hands slain days earlier.

The group carries 27 mock coffins, representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Speaking ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six slain hostages whose remains were recovered over the weekend, accuses Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shout: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann says, noting the number of days she was held captive. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo): 
Content: "After almost 10 months of simmering conflict, the prospect of an all-out war scares many.

When Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s hardline finance minister, arrives, the crowd swells and the sense of anger mounts.

He’s accosted by angry locals. Many people are simply standing by the crater, taking in the scene, lost in thought.

In the corner of the pitch, someone has tried to remove the bloodstains on the astroturf, but with only limited success.

Outside the fence, bicycles and scooters lie scattered, all blackened from yesterday’s brief but devastating fireball.

There’s a bomb shelter metres away, but when the siren sounded last night, the children had mere seconds to respond. They had absolutely no chance.

Israel says the rocket was fired from Shebaa, a small village just a short distance away across the western flank of Mt Hermon, which towers over Majdal Shams.

Hezbollah disputes Israel’s claim, but around the time the rocket landed here, its media outlets announced that it had fired rockets towards an Israeli military base less than two miles from the football pitch.

Golan Heights strike: 'The whole town is mourning'

Golan Heights strike: 'There was a siren, but no-one had time to react'

The scene around the football pitch here in Majdal Shams, where 12 children and young people died on Saturday, is quiet and deeply sombre.

There are plenty of people here - local Druze elders in their distinctive red and white turbans and baggy trousers, military officials, visiting government ministers and of course many journalists.

But conversations around the crater where the rocket landed are hushed, respectful.

A black flag flies at the spot where the rocket landed last night, gouging a shallow crater in the pitch and blowing out the metal fence around it. <image:12133>!Reuters People mourning after Golan Heights strike <image:12134>Reuters

Residents fear all-out war after an strike on a football pitch killed 12 children in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights

This is a day of funerals for those who died here, most of them boys and girls between 10 and 16. Some are demanding a decisive response against Hezbollah. Some accuse the government of abandoning the Golan Heights.

Mr Smotrich tries to offer his condolences, even to hug those around him. <image:12133>!Reuters Mourners surround coffins in the streets <image:12136>Reuters

Thousands gathered in the streets on Sunday for the funerals of the young people who were killed in the strike

The people of Majdal Shams are used to the sound of rockets overhead, but Saturday’s attack took them all by surprise.

“I don’t think the government needs to respond,” Nassar says. They don’t need more war,” another says.

CNN  — 

Israel vowed Hezbollah will “pay the price” after blaming the Lebanese militant group for [a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html)
 that killed 12 children, touching off fears once again that an all-out war would envelop the region.

Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks.

Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, according to a [statement](https://t.me/idfofficial/9222)
 from the military on Sunday morning. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from those strikes.

And on a visit to the town of Majdal Shams near the Syrian and Lebanese borders, where the rocket attack left children and teenagers dead on Saturday, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response.

“Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he added: “We will hit the enemy hard.”

The Saturday attacks on the region involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in a barrage Israel’s military quickly blamed on the Iran-backed militant group.

It killed 12 children and left 44 people injured, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.

The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN. Smotrich was eventually ushered away by security.

Fears of wider war spread
-------------------------

Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on a near-daily basis since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7, and those exchanges have become increasingly volatile, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East.

While Hezbollah admitted striking the Golan Heights on Saturday, it rejected responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams.

“We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” a statement read.

Analysing footage of the explosion and the aftermath, experts told CNN the blast and damage were consistent with the types of munitions fired at northern Israel and the Golan Heights from Lebanon and Syria.

Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, told CNN Sunday that weapon fragments at the scene indicated the rocket was fired by Hezbollah or another militant group. His office said following the meeting that the cabinet had “authorized the prime minister and the minister of defense to decide on the nature of the response against the terror organization Hezbollah, and on its’ timing.”

The prime minister said earlier that he was “shocked” by the attack. Throughout the 34-day war, Hezbollah is estimated to have fired around 4,000 rockets – a daily average of 117.

Bou Habib stressed that another war would not only be detrimental to Lebanon, but to Israel as well.

“\[Israel\] will return to the stone ages as well, it’s not by the Lebanese government,” he said, referring to comments by Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant back in June 2023, in which he said the Israeli military could send Lebanon “back to the Stone Age.”

However, Bou Habib told the Lebanese Al Jadeed News TV channel that Lebanon had received reassurances from third countries that Israel’s response would be “limited.” He added that Hezbollah would in turn limit its actions. Pressed by the anchor to identify the countries that had offered this reassurance, he hinted that the “US and France are very concerned about the issue.”

Lebanon has called for an international investigation into the attack to determine who was responsible.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

What happened early Sunday?
---------------------------

The situation between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group remains tense. Flights that were already en route to Ben Gurion were diverted to other airports.

Israel's Home Front Command raised the alert level in northern Israel and encouraged people to stay near bomb shelters.

.

Earlier this month, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby [said the U.S. officials have been communicating continuously with their Israeli counterparts," National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement.

Here's a look at where things stand:

!ISRAEL-LEBANON-PALESTINIAN-CONFLICT-HEZBOLLAH-ATTACKS  <image:12173>

This photo taken from a position in northern Israel shows a Hezbollah UAV intercepted by the Israeli Air Force over north Israel on Aug. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it launched an attack on Israeli military positions with a large number of drones. Two other soldiers were "lightly and moderately injured," Israel said.

"Approximately ninety percent of the targets struck were short-range rockets aimed at northern Israel," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement on Sunday, adding, "Hezbollah planned to harm Israeli civilians."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at the start of a Cabinet meeting, said the military had eliminated "thousands of rockets that were aimed at northern Israel" and urged citizens to adhere to directives from the Home Front Command.

"We are determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us — we will harm them," he said.

What was involved in the attack
-------------------------------

Lt. "Most of them either fell on their way to Israeli territory, landed in open areas, or were intercepted by Israeli Air Force defense systems and Israeli Navy ships."

Hezbollah said its attack involved more than 320 Katyusha rockets aimed at multiple sites in Israel and a "large number" of drones. It said the operation was targeting "a qualitative Israeli military target that will be announced later" as well as "enemy sites and barracks and Iron Dome (missile defense) platforms."

Hezbollah later announced the end of what it said was the first stage of retaliatory strikes, which it said would allow it to launch more attacks deeper into Israel. was preparing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-says-potential-iran-hezbollah-israel-attack-this-week/)

The attacks come as delegations from the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt [are holding another round of cease-fire talks in Cairo](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-talks/)
.

A spokesman for the National Security Council, Sean Savett, said President Biden was "closely monitoring" the events in Israel and Lebanon and that he has been engaged with his national security team throughout the evening.

Key Points

*   Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones against Israel on Sunday in retaliation for the assassination of a senior commander in Beirut last month.
*   Hezbollah said it had launched more than 320 Katyusha rockets towards Israel and hit 11 military targets.
*   Israeli jets hit targets in Lebanon shortly before the strikes as the military assessed that Hezbollah was preparing to begin the barrage, the military said.

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel's military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a bigger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapor trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

The extent of damage was not immediately clear and Hezbollah indicated it was not planning further strikes yet, while Israel's Foreign Minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war.

Any major escalation in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah's backer Iran and Israel's main ally the United States.

Sunday's strikes came as negotiators were meeting in Cairo in a last-ditch effort to conclude a halt to the fighting in Gaza.

The Iran-backed Lebanese group said it had fired 320 Katyusha rockets towards Israel and hit 11 military targets in what it called the first phase of its retaliation for Israel's assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander, last month.

Israel's military said it had foiled a much larger attack with pre-emptive airstrikes after assessing that Hezbollah was preparing to launch the barrage, using 100 jets to strike more than 40 Hezbollah launch sites in southern Lebanon.

The strikes destroyed thousands of launcher barrels, aimed mostly at northern Israel but also targeting some central areas, Israel's military said.

Hezbollah dismissed Israel's statement that the group's attack had been foiled with pre-emptive strikes, saying it had been able to launch its drones as planned and that the rest of its response to Shukr's killing would take "some time".

Israel's Army Radio, citing defense officials, said the military assessed that the Hezbollah barrage on northern Israel was "improvised" after the pre-emptive strike by Israeli jets on the Hezbollah launch sites.

Regional conflict risk
----------------------

President Joe Biden was following events closely, the White House said.

"At his direction, senior U.S. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was on high alert all over the country.

The Israeli military issued civil defense instructions from central Israel to the north, limiting gatherings but authorizing people to go to work as long as they were able to reach air raid shelters quickly. There were no casualties immediately reported in Israel, according to the ambulance service.

Israeli media said the barrage hitting northern areas had damaged some houses and a chicken coop.

A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the country's south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October.

One of the strikes on the town of Khiam killed one fighter from the Hezbollah-allied Shi'ite group Amal, two security sources told Reuters. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah will speak on television later on Sunday, the group said.

The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the U.N.'s special coordinator's office in the country called on all sides to cease fire, calling the developments overnight "worrying".

Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last month killed 12 youngsters and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response.

Warning sirens
--------------

In northern Israel, warning sirens sounded and multiple explosions were heard around several areas as Israel's Iron Dome aerial defense system shot down rockets coming from southern Lebanon. We will keep supporting Israel's right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability," said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.

Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.

That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Shukr, one of Hezbollah's most senior military commanders.

Shukr's death in an air strike was quickly followed by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which led to vows of reprisal against Israel by Iran."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. <image:12133>, <image:12134>, <image:12136>, <image:10246>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. <image:12133>, <image:12134>, <image:12136>, <image:10246>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, second left, and Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan, left, stand in a structure in the area of the former settlement of Sa-Nur in the northern West Bank, August 7, 2025. The two-word phrase, written in blue on the column on the photo's right, reads 'Death to Arabs.' (Roei Hadi/Samaria Regional Council)

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Thursday disavowed the slogan “Death to Arabs” after being photographed next to the graffitied phrase during a tour of the northern West Bank, in which he vowed to rebuild the settlement of Sa-Nur that was evacuated decades ago.

Smotrich, who also serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry, was photographed next to the slogan as he visited the site to mark 20 years since it and the nearby settlement Homesh were dismantled as part of Israel’s 2005 Disengagement Plan. The plan also saw Israel evacuate the Gaza Strip’s Gush Katif settlement bloc, which Smotrich has called on Israel to rebuild as well amid the war in Gaza.

Following online criticism of the photograph, Smotrich’s office said in a statement that the offending phrase was noticed only “after the photo was distributed, and of course we completely disavow it.”

Smotrich’s office said the media shouldn’t be concerned by “stupid graffiti that no one noticed,” but by the minister’s drive to “reverse the expulsion from northern Samaria and resettle Sa-Nur.”

The photograph was included in a press release by the Samaria Regional Council, which oversees settlers’ municipal affairs in the northern West Bank. Council head Yossi Dagan, who also appeared in the photo, later sent out a second press release with the “Death to Arabs” graffiti cropped out of the picture, without apologizing for the phrase or explaining the reason for the edit.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid slammed Smotrich on X: “Aside from the moral issue, what in God’s name does the government expect us to say to the world when a photo is published of a senior minister smiling next to the inscription ‘Death to Arabs’?”

[! “That applies to Gaza, and it’s even more true here.”

The Palestinian Authority issued a strong condemnation of Smotrich’s visit, saying it was part of “plans to entrench the gradual annexation of the West Bank, posing a direct threat to the possibility of implementing the two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In a statement, the PA foreign ministry said the push “to revive settlements that were evacuated 20 years ago” would lead to further confiscation of Palestinian lands.

Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed in May that Israel had approved the construction of 22 new West Bank settlements, including Sa-Nur and Homesh.

Israeli NGO Peace Now, which monitors settlement activity in the West Bank, said some of the 22 settlements the government announced as new had already existed on the ground.

Some are neighborhoods that were upgraded to independent settlements, and others are unrecognized outposts given formal status under Israeli law, according to Peace Now.

The CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html)) details a Hezbollah missile barrage against Israel.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results describe escalating tensions and attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024. The CBS News article ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/)) reports on Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Hezbollah attacks on Israel, mentioning that Israel's Home Front Command raised the alert level and encouraged people to stay near bomb shelters. The CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html)) details a Hezbollah missile barrage against Israel. The Washington Post article ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/25/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/25/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes/)) reports on the heaviest strikes exchanged between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024. None of the articles mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. <image:12174>, <image:12173>, <image:12189>, <image:12133>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm escalating tensions and attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, they do not mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich image location")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results provide information about Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's presence in various locations and events. The Haaretz and Times of Israel articles mention Smotrich's visit to an Israeli settlement in the northern West Bank on August 7, 2025, where he was photographed near graffiti. The Getty Images search result contains multiple photographs of Smotrich at different events, including a Jerusalem Day Flag March on June 5, 2024, a party meeting on February 5, 2024, and a visit to the Knesset. <image:12231>, <image:12232>, <image:12241>, <image:12242>, <image:12243>, <image:12244>, <image:12245>, <image:12246>, <image:12251>, <image:12252>, <image:12257>, <image:12258>

None of the provided sources mention the context of the image in the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results provide information about Smotrich's presence in various locations and events, but none of them mention the context of the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because the provided evidence does not support it. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, nor do they provide any context for the image. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unverified. While there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was present at other events, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on that date ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)).

**An Algerian judoka has been disqualified after failing the weigh-in before facing an Israeli opponent at the Olympic Games.**

Messaoud Redouane Dris, 22, had been scheduled to face Tohar Butbul in the -73kg category on Monday.

However, Dris weighed in above the 73kg limit ahead of the contest and was removed from the draw.

Games organisers confirmed his disqualification and awarded Butbul a walkover to the next round.

Algeria's judo federation and national Olympic committee are yet to comment.

The Israeli Olympic Committee alleged his failure to compete had been deliberate and was strongly critical of the Algerian.

"Tohar's competitor has removed himself from the competition," the Israeli body said in a statement.

"The Israeli delegation will continue to compete with the Olympic values in mind, we believe this kind of behaviour has no place in the world of sport."

Another Algerian judoka, Fethi Nourine, was [handed a 10-year ban](/sport/olympics/58556940)
 by the International Judo Federation after withdrawing from a bout against Butbul at the Tokyo Games in 2021.

In that specific case, Nourine said at the time that his political support for the Palestinian cause made it impossible for him to compete.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

The evidence supports the claim that an Algerian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent. However, the reason for the withdrawal was a failure to weigh-in, not a direct withdrawal.

  !A workmen measures a door in a building damaged by an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 19. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack as part of its support for Palestinians.**

Drone strikes Tel Aviv, killing one. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.

The drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The Houthis say they are acting to show solidarity with the Palestinians over the war in Gaza, though the civilian shipping traffic involves vessels from around the world.

Tel Aviv came under heavy rocket fire from Hamas in the early weeks of the war last fall, but the attacks have long since stopped. Houthis claim responsibility** **The deadly drone slammed into an apartment building on the Tel Aviv oceanfront just after 3 a.m. <image:12306>

Israeli police investigate the scene of a drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel on Friday. But this attack apparently caught Israeli forces off-guard.

Sirens typically provide a warning when Tel Aviv or other cities come under aerial attack. The official described it as "human error." The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.

Given the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.

The Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone "capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. Hamas occasionally fires rockets into southern Israel.

The main aerial threat to Israel has been coming from the north, with Hezbollah and Israel trading rocket fire across the border on a daily basis.

Houthis Launch New Wave of Attacks
==================================

! But, global officials and most experts had, until the Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, broadly assumed that the Houthis would continue to focus their response to the Gaza war on [attacking commercial shipping](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-march-26/)
 in the Red Sea. The attacks came after the latest in a series of lulls in Houthi attacks on shipping – halts that, in the past, led to speculation that the [Houthi weapons arsenals](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-january-22/)
 might be running low.

The Houthi strike on Tel Aviv has moved the group from the margins of the Gaza conflict to the center of diplomacy and the allied strategy to try to end the fighting permanently. and its allies have used to try to end the Houthi strikes on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have failed to deter the group.
*   The Houthis’ ability to continue striking targets in and around Yemen suggests their missile and drone arsenal was more extensive than was believed and the group might still be receiving resupply from Iran.
*   Israel’s retaliation on an oil refinery at Hodeidah could complicate U.S.-led efforts to contain the Houthi threat and potentially expand regional warfare even further.

**The threat to regional peace and security posed by the [Houthi movement (Ansarallah)](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-june-11/)
 in Yemen expanded Friday when the group launched an explosive-laden drone on Tel Aviv in the pre-dawn hours, striking an apartment building and killing an Israeli man while wounding several others.** The drone reportedly flew near the U.S. forces but later assessed the attack was by Israel, and quoted Yemen’s Health Ministry as reporting the strike had killed and wounded several persons.

The Houthi attack on Tel Aviv demonstrated that U.S. The Houthi attacks have reduced commercial ship traffic by nearly half, but otherwise produced no measurable effect on Israeli, U.S., or global policy on the Gaza war or the broader region.

The Tel Aviv drone strike came days after the Houthis demonstrated they still have an ample and varied supply of weaponry in their arsenal. escalation against the Houthis has the potential to further expand the Gaza crisis into a regional conflagration.

**Bottom Line up Front**

*   On Friday, the Houthi movement in Yemen sought to implement its threats against Israel by conducting a strike on Tel Aviv with an Iranian-made long-range drone.
*   The diplomatic, military, and economic tools the U.S. Two attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted ships in the Red Sea on July 15, even as the U.S. The spokesman said that Tel Aviv will continue to be a primary target for the terror group “within the range of our weapons.”

The attack rattled the Israeli security establishment, which has prided itself on fielding the most sophisticated missile, rocket, and drone defense in the region, if not the world."

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

 Most personal Windows PCs were unaffected, since CrowdStrike's software was primarily used by organisations.[\[18\]](#cite_note-CS_servers_down-18)
 The CrowdStrike software did not provide a way for subscribers to delay the installation of its content files.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 Computers running [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS")

 Within hours, CrowdStrike [CEO](/wiki/CEO "CEO")
 [George Kurtz](/wiki/George_Kurtz "George Kurtz")

### Remedy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Remedy")\
\]

Affected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet")
, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[23\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike.com-240719-23)

If crashes persisted, remediation required booting into [safe mode](/wiki/Safe_mode "Safe mode")
 or the [Windows Recovery Environment](/wiki/Windows_Recovery_Environment "Windows Recovery Environment")
 and deleting any `.sys` file beginning with `C-00000291-` and with timestamp 04:09 UTC in the `[%windir%](/wiki/%25windir%25 "%windir%") \[System32](/wiki/Special_folder#File_system_directories "Special folder") \[drivers](/wiki/Driver_(computing) "Driver (computing)") \CrowdStrike\` directory.[\[28\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike_072024-28)
 As this process needed to be done locally on each individual machine, it was "expected to take days" for affected businesses to restore all systems.[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Technical staff needed to reboot the affected computers individually with manual intervention on each system.[\[33\]](#cite_note-CSI_1-33)
[\[34\]](#cite_note-HOB_1-34)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-CSW_1-35)

On devices with Windows' [BitLocker](/wiki/BitLocker "BitLocker")
 disk encryption enabled, which corporations often use to increase security, fixing the problem was exacerbated because the 48-digit numeric Bitlocker recovery keys (unique to each system) required manual input, with additional challenges supplying the recovery keys to end users working remotely.

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

Flight cancellations into or out of the US have topped 3,000 flights as of 8:40 p.m. “But at that point, the damage had been done, and we now had to move into manual mode.”

In manual mode, it takes a village to reboot computer devices and reload operating systems, DeWalt said, adding some of the companies “spent the entire night deploying thousands of people by hand reloading operating systems, starting servers back up again.”

After discovering the problem wasn’t an attack, but rather a conflict with a Microsoft update that occurred earlier, the group had to race against the clock.

The ongoing global IT outage is impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.

Marriott International has nearly 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, according to the company’s website.

**Impact at other hotels:** An assistant manager at the Hilton Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, said they have been having to manually unlock guests’ rooms because the outage impacted the software the hotel uses to make key cards.

Businesses worldwide grappled with an ongoing major IT outage Friday, as financial services and doctors' offices were disrupted, while some TV broadcasters went offline. Air travel has been hit particularly hard, with planes grounded, services delayed and airports issuing advice to passengers.

The outage came as cybersecurity giant [CrowdStrike experienced a major disruption](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-suffers-major-outage-affecting-businesses-around-the-world.html)
 early Friday following an issue with a recent tech update.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has since said that the company is "actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts," stressing that Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.

"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. He emphasized again that the outage was not caused by a security breach or cyberattack.

"As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again," he wrote.

Over 10,000 Israelis relocate to Canada since early 2024
========================================================

Published :  

15-11-2024 13:13|

[World](/section/4)

Since Oct. 7, 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in the number of "Israelis" seeking to relocate to Canada, "Israeli" newspaper Haaretz reported.

Reports from Canadian immigration authorities show that over 10,000 "Israelis" made the move to Canada in early 2024, with around 8,000 of them obtaining work visas. This marks a significant jump compared to previous years.

While political unrest and escalating violence in the region are major contributors, many "Israelis" cite dissatisfaction with the state of the country’s political system and social inequalities as additional driving forces behind their decision to leave.

Data from the Canadian Ministry of Immigration reveals that between December 2023 and September 2024, a total of 3,425 temporary work visas were approved for "Israelis", out of 3,705 applications.

Moreover, "Israeli" media outlets such as Yedioth Ahronoth reported that even before the aggression on Gaza reached its current intensity, there was a rising trend in the number of "Israelis" choosing to emigrate

Chinese travel agencies have canceled trips to Israel amid the escalated conflict there, which flared up over the weekend. Chinese airlines have adjusted flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.  
   
"We quickly screened all orders after the conflict broke out, and as of now, our company has no tourists stranded in Israel," Tongcheng Travel told the Global Times on Monday morning.   
  
For travel groups planning to travel to Israel in October and November, the company communicated with those clients and processed full refunds. In addition, business work related to tourism in Israel has been temporarily suspended, the agency noted.   
  
GZL International Travel Service told the Global Times that it has decided to cancel all travel groups to Israel in October. It sent two travel groups to the country in September, but both have since returned to China.    
  
Chinese travel agency Spring Tour confirmed to the Global Times that the company has canceled a 28-member tour to Israel that was scheduled to depart on Monday, given the escalated tensions there, and tours departing after that point will be subject to notifications from relevant departments and the actual situation on the ground.  
  
The move came after the escalated conflict there, as Israel's cabinet declared a "state of war" on Sunday against Hamas, in which at least 700 in Israel died while retaliatory Israeli airstrikes killed at least 413 in Gaza, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.  
  
On August 10 , the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the third list of countries, including Israel, to resume outbound group tours.  
   
China's Hainan Airlines, the only carrier in China with flights to Israel, told the Global Times that it canceled flights between Shanghai and Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday due to the ongoing high tensions there, and will adjust flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.   
  
The airline has three direct flights between China and the country, which depart from Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, operating twice a week on each route.  
  
Data shared by the information provider VariFlight showed that the flight from Shenzhen to Tel Aviv on Tuesday was canceled.  
  
The airline later said on its official Weibo on Monday afternoon that its follow-up flight plans for Israel routes will continue to be implemented. There has been no adjustment for the time being in an effort to maximize and ensure the normal travel of passengers.  
  
It will pay close attention to changes in the overseas security situation and dynamically adjust relevant flight plans as soon as possible, the airline said.   
  
The Foreign Ministry activated the emergency consular protection mechanism immediately after the conflict broke out to coordinate and engage in work on protecting Chinese nationals and institutions in Palestine and Israel, said Mao Ning, ministry spokesperson, on Monday. The spokesperson reminded Chinese nationals not to travel to Palestine or Israel.   
  
We would like to once again call on relevant parties to immediately stop the fighting, protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation. Mao said.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`

Content: "![People gather at the scene of an deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024. They \[the government\] have to go,” the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza.

Until the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.

[Hezbollah in southern Lebanon](/news/2024/7/17/hezbollah-threatens-to-fire-on-new-israeli-targets)
 has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.

Following the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as “a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters”.

It said the Yemeni fighters were supporting “the heroic” Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending “all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations”.

The group said the fight will not stop until “the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”.

The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also praised the Houthi rebels for “a new heroic operation” against Israel, adding that Palestinians appreciated the “steadfast” support of Gaza.

Yemen’s [Houthi group](/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide)
 has claimed responsibility for an apparent drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, which killed one person and injured at least 10.

A spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media on Friday that the Iran-aligned group had “targeted ‘Tel Aviv’ in occupied Palestine”.

It claimed that it used a new drone “capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being unable to be detected by radars”.

The Israeli military said it had opened an investigation into the large explosion near the United States embassy office in the city and would determine why the country’s air defence systems were not activated to intercept the “aerial target”.

“We’re talking about a large UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] that can fly large distances,” a military official told a briefing for journalists following the strike. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on July 19, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where police said one person was found dead. The rebels fired a "new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems," Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement on social media.(Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN / AFP)](/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AFP__20240719__364K2UX__v4__HighRes__IsraelYemenPalestinianConflictExplosion-1721380407.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Israel’s air force has increased patrols to “protect the country’s skies”, the military said in a post on social media.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised retaliation.

“We will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,” Israeli Army Radio quoted Gallant as saying.

Israeli police said the body of a man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and that the circumstances were being investigated.

Footage from the site of the blast showed broken glass strewn across pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. The site was sealed off by police tape.

Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.

The Israeli government has [banned Al Jazeera](/news/2024/5/6/israel-bans-al-jazeera-what-does-it-mean-and-what-happens-next)
 from broadcasting from the country.

“Where this drone hit is a part of the city that is very close to the US embassy branch office. It’s a very densely populated area, a high-security area,” Jamjoom said.

If the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel’s radar systems undetected, “there’s going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means”, said Jamjoom.

“How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable “offensive response”.

Israeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was “further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel”.

“Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv."

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

Following renewed Houthi missile threats, major airlines have extended flight suspensions to Israel, citing escalating security risks near Ben Gurion Airport.

![Houthi Israel Airport](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi militia has again threatened to strike Israel’s main international gateway, Ben Gurion Airport (TLV), raising concerns over flight safety and prompting international [airline](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/topic/airlines/)
 responses.

**Details on Houthis’ threats to Israel and Ben Gurion Airport** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer posted a photo of TLV on social media platform X with the warning: “In the coming hours, Yemeni forces will carry out military operations against Ben Gurion and other Zionist airports.” The statement mirrored recent IDF evacuation alerts for Houthi-held Yemeni ports.

The latest threat marks the second in 24 hours. Earlier, Amer warned: “We will strike Ben Gurion Airport in the coming hours. Evacuate immediately.” Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Amer urged international airlines to avoid TLV and Israeli airspace: “They should change course and take seriously the warnings of the Yemeni military… not only over Ben Gurion Airport but over all of Israeli airspace.”

In response, the Israeli Air Force [bombed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7050j07gedo)
 key Houthi infrastructure, including Sanaa Airport (SAH).

Amid the rising threat, several international airlines have suspended flights to Israel. Let’s keep exploring the future of aviation together!

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.
