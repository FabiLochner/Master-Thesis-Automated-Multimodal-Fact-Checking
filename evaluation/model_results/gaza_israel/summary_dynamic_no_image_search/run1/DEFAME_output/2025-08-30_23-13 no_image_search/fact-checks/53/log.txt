The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, the provided evidence, including reports from [Iran International](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585) and the [Indiana Capital Chronicle](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), does not support the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
