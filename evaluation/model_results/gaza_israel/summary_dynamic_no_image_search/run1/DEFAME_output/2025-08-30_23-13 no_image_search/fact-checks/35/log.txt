Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sahneprojesi.org/blog-yazilari/fotograftakiler-israilin-saldirisinda-olen-nasrallahin-yuzukleri-mi/): Found exact image on website with title: Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail'in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah'ın yüzükleri mi?
Content: The website "Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail’in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah’ın yüzükleri mi?" discusses an image of rings and a piece of paper, claiming they belonged to Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah after an Israeli airstrike. The article states that the image was circulating on social media after Nasrallah's death. However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo was not recent and was actually from January 7, 2024, and the rings belonged to Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, who was killed by the US military. The article concludes that the claim is false. The article was published on September 30, 2024, and the author is Gözde Yel. <image:10219>, <image:11170>, <image:11172>, <image:11173>.

The claim '<image:10219> This image shows the remains of Nasrallah's ring after being killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is not recent and has been circulating since January 2024, with the rings belonging to Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, according to sources like [Hakikah](https://hakikah.net/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%9F/) and [Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail’in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah’ın yüzükleri mi?](https://www.sahneprojesi.org/blog-yazilari/fotograftakiler-israilin-saldirisinda-olen-nasrallahin-yuzukleri-mi/).
