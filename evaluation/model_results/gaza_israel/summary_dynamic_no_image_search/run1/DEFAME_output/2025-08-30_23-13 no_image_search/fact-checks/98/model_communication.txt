 [! The quote also says that the Israeli government and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “heartless criminals without a drop of humanity.” The same wording has been circulated on Russian-language [pages](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0SRBRLHpy3yUgpPSRqKTJB2yPeDom8hSAuiBumfx2B1Xexvszh93Ete8hJHQfRWx3l&id=100070217693211)

**The quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is fake. No such statement appears on any of the actor’s official pages, nor has it been reported by any reputable media outlet.**

The quote about the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government, allegedly made by Dwayne Johnson, is fabricated. Johnson expressed sympathy for the families of the victims.

__Screenshot of Dwayne Johnson’s post__

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)
 by the organization Snopes.

The appearance of the fake quote may be directly connected to events that occurred at the end of July. The city had been considered a key hub for the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.

**About the Source:**

Among others, the fake quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is being spread by a Facebook account belonging to [Zaal Mamatsashvili](https://www.facebook.com/zaal.mamatsashvili/posts/pfbid02ZV5icDdtmZzamBaPfkzkBa1LbrBuTVdevkkWGkfsuRSLoZVoFnzTAvrBqKq47j7l)

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is used as the cover art for the song "Jewish Rock" by Shawn Pelofsky. The image is not an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag in support of Israel. The evidence also shows that a quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson about Israel is fake. However, Dwayne Johnson has shown support for Israel.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.
