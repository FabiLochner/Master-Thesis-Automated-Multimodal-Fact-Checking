Content: The search result from Buffalo.edu, published on November 20, 2024, discusses an AI-generated image falsely claiming Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized. The article mentions AFP Fact Check debunking the image.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/netanyahu-hospital-prostate-budget-bill-intl-latam): 
Content: CNN reports that Benjamin Netanyahu left a Jerusalem hospital on December 31, 2024, against his doctor's orders to help his party pass a divisive budget law. He had undergone prostate removal surgery two days prior. <image:10202> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:10202> This is an authentic image of Benjamin Netanyahu being hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024 due to a serious health issue.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image in question has been identified as potentially fake or AI-generated, and was used to falsely claim Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized in November 2024, as reported by PesaCheck ([https://pesacheck.org/fake-this-image-claiming-to-show-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-admitted-in-hospital-isnt-24197dac209e](https://pesacheck.org/fake-this-image-claiming-to-show-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-admitted-in-hospital-isnt-24197dac209e)) and the University at Buffalo ([https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html)). While Netanyahu did have surgery in December 2024, the image is not associated with that event in reliable sources.

So, the overall veracity is: false
