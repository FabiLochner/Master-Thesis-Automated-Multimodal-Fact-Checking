The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Trump signed executive orders on January 20, 2025, as documented by sources like [KFF.org](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/), [Akingump.com](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/trump-executive-order-overview), and [USCRI](https://refugees.org/uscri-summary-of-january-20-executive-orders/), none of these sources mention an executive order specifically halting funding to UNRWA.

So, the overall veracity is: false
