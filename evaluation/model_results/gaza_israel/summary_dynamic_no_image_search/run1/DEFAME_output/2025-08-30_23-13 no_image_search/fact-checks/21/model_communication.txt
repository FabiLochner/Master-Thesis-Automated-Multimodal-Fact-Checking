United States President Donald Trump is planning to cut off US engagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council and extend a funding ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, an unnamed White House official told US media outlets.

US news media, including Politico and NPR, reported on Monday that Trump was expected to sign an executive order withdrawing from the two UN bodies on Tuesday, the same day the White House is [expected to host](/news/2025/1/28/israels-netanyahu-to-meet-with-trump-at-white-house-next-week)
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime critic of the UN, and UNRWA in particular.

Since taking office for a second term on January 20, Trump has already withdrawn the US from [the World Health Organization (WHO)](/news/2025/1/28/what-a-us-exit-from-the-who-means-for-global-healthcare)
 and the [Paris climate agreement](/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out)
, which he also withdrew from during his first term – a move that was later reversed by the Biden administration.

Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the UN Human Rights Council would also not be a first for Trump, who withdrew from the council in his first term.

When the Trump administration quit the Human Rights Council in 2018, Trump’s then-UN envoy Nikki Haley claimed the move was due to “chronic bias” against Israel from the body, which is made up of 47 UN member states who are elected for four-year terms.

The council conducts periodic reviews of the human rights records of UN member states, including the US, which is due to undergo its next review in August.

During the council’s last review of the US in 2020, countries offered recommendations on how Washington might improve its human rights record, including by tackling racism and closing the Guantanamo Bay prison.

The council is also responsible for appointing human rights experts to serve as independent UN special rapporteurs.

Several UN special rapporteurs have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, including, most notably, the special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese.

As an elected member of the council, most recently from 2022-2024, the US has also leveraged its position to criticise the human rights record of other countries.

UNRWA order comes as Netanyahu visits White House
-------------------------------------------------

Trump’s plan to sign another executive order specifically targeting the embattled UNRWA coincides with Netanyahu’s visit to the White House.

According to a UNRWA [situation report](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-156-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem)
, Israeli forces killed 272 UNRWA staff members during Israel’s 15-month onslaught on the Gaza Strip and repeatedly attacked UNRWA buildings, including schools where thousands of Palestinians were seeking shelter.

In October, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed two bills [banning UNRWA operations](/news/2024/10/29/what-does-unrwa-do-and-why-has-israel-banned-it-from-west-bank-gaza)
 within Israel’s borders, including occupied East Jerusalem, which came into effect last week. Founded by the UN General Assembly in 1949, UNRWA provides aid, health and education services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

![UNRWA at a glance](/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/INTERACTIVE-UNRWA-at-a-glance-1706592698.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

The US was UNRWA’s biggest donor, providing $300m to $400m a year, but Biden paused funding in January 2024 after Israel made unfounded accusations about a dozen UNRWA staff taking part in the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas.

Although an independent report found that Israeli authorities [did not provide evidence](/news/2024/4/22/no-evidence-of-unrwa-staff-links-terrorist-groups-independent-review)
 for their claims to the UN, the US Congress decided to formally suspend contributions to UNRWA until at least March 2025. The [UN later found](/news/2024/8/5/un-says-nine-employees-may-have-been-involved-in-october-7-hamas-attack)
 that nine employees may have been involved in the attack and were fired.

UNRWA is playing a vital role in Gaza’s recovery as a fragile ceasefire continues to hold between Israel and Hamas.

Trump and Netanyahu are expected to discuss the next phase of the ceasefire deal when they meet.

Speaking after Netanyahu arrived in the US on Monday, Trump said there were “no guarantees” that the ceasefire deal would hold.

**Editor's note:**

Through President Trump’s announcement that his administration would no longer fund UNRWA, America has further written itself out of the process of peacemaking in the Middle East, argues Hady Amr. Trump’s message will engender the opposite of goodwill and will further erode America’s moral leadership in the Middle East.

Indeed, the long-term problem is more profound, and it’s essential to understand because the Trump administration seeks to redefine [what it means to be a Palestinian refugee](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/trump-palestinians-unrwa-funding/569167/)
, which in turn could have implications for refugees worldwide.

Underlying the Trump administration’s cuts to UNRWA is the false premise that Palestinian refugees derive their refugee status from UNRWA. This post is adapted from a piece originally published on [The Hill](http://thehill.com/opinion/international/404931-the-straw-that-may-break-the-us-back-as-middle-east-peacemakers)
.

As if to boast, in a call to mark the Jewish New Year, [President Trump told American Jewish leaders:](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-to-us-jews-i-wont-give-palestinians-more-aid-until-theres-a-deal/)
 “I stopped massive amounts of money that we were paying to the Palestinians.” Trump added he told the Palestinians, “We’re not paying until you make a deal.” On the face of it, such an approach may seem like a typical Trump negotiating tactic, but the decision is so misguided that in addition to having dire immediate consequences, it will haunt the United States for years to come.

Trump was referring to the State Department’s recent abrupt announcement that his administration would no longer fund the [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/08/285648.htm)
, reversing a policy of support by every American president—Republican and Democrat—since it was created about 70 years ago as a cornerstone of America’s support for stability in the Middle East and flagship of our values to provide for the most vulnerable.

Indeed, UNRWA is so in-sync with our values that [American citizens voluntarily give millions of dollars, collectively, to UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/overalldonor_ranking.pdf)
 each year via U.S. What is also true is that Trump’s action is based on such a fundamentally flawed misunderstanding of the situation that it may have the opposite of its intended effect.

But before we get to that, let’s look at the immediate impact: UNRWA, which provides vital life-saving services, health care and education to stateless refugees in the Middle East, is now scrambling for funds.

[These funds go toward](https://www.unrwa.org/what-we-do)
 a modern, secular education for 500,000 boys and girls; vaccinations and health clinics that provide services to over three million refugees and a basic level of dignity for millions who otherwise would lead lives of despair.

While some donors like Canada, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are stepping in to offset part of what the United States is cutting, UNRWA will still likely have to reduce services. Even the [Israeli military knows](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/IDF-concerned-funding-cuts-to-UNRWA-could-lead-to-attacks-566077)
 that cutting funding for basic services to refugees are a recipe for disaster for Israel.

Nowhere are the UNRWA cuts more acute than in the Gaza Strip, where about two million souls inhabit a tiny area twice the size of Washington, DC that few can gain permission to leave. UNRWA’s role is simply to provide social services to these stateless refugees—not determine who is and who isn’t a refugee under international law.

Also underlying Trump’s attack on UNRWA is the false premise that other refugee populations don’t transfer their refugee status to their children. [Wrong again.](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/exploding-myths-unrwa-unhcr-and-palestine-refugees)
 International law conveys refugee status to children of other refugee populations until permanent homes can be found. People from [Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, and Somalia](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/09/in-refugees-israel-palestine-sekulow-middle-east-trumps-orbit-few-palestinians-count-as-refugees/)
 are but a number of the populations where refugee status has been conveyed to descendants.

Finally, underlying Trump’s decision is the false premise that cutting funds to UNRWA and to [development projects in the West Bank and Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-palestinians/trump-cuts-more-than-200-million-in-u-s-aid-to-palestinians-idUSKCN1L923C)
 will somehow pressure the Palestinian Authority. Trump has sent an unmistakable message to the Palestinian people: He callously disregards their most basic needs. We already know that Trump’s actions have been antithetical to refugees at home and abroad, and we also know that in a global economy of over $100 trillion dollars, a meager $300 million cut by the United States should be able to be covered by another country.

That’s true on both counts, but in that truth lies the problem: the problem for America, for Palestinians, and even for Israelis."

The evidence suggests that Trump signed executive orders on January 20, 2025. However, none of the provided sources explicitly mention an executive order on that date specifically halting funding to UNRWA. The sources mention executive orders related to rescinding previous orders, gender ideology, regulatory freezes, offshore wind leasing, and refugee admissions.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA."

## Actions
```
web_search("Trump executive order UNRWA funding halt")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on February 3, 2025, that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA (<image:10629>). Al Jazeera reported on February 4, 2025, that Trump is planning to extend a funding ban on UNRWA and is expected to sign an executive order (<image:k>).

The Brookings Institution published an article on September 7, 2018, discussing Trump's decision to eliminate US funding for UNRWA. The article states that Trump's actions will have dire consequences and are based on a flawed understanding of the situation (<image:10635>, <image:10636>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA. NPR reported this on February 3, 2025. Al Jazeera reported on February 4, 2025, that Trump was planning to extend a funding ban on UNRWA and was expected to sign an executive order.

The Brookings Institution article from September 7, 2018, discusses Trump's decision to eliminate US funding for UNRWA, which suggests that Trump had previously taken actions related to UNRWA funding.

The claim states that the executive order was signed on January 20, 2025. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the exact date of the executive order.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
KFF.org ([https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/)) lists two executive orders issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025: "Initial rescissions of Executive Orders and Actions issued by President Biden" and "Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government."

Akingump.com ([https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/trump-executive-order-overview](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/trump-executive-order-overview)) mentions an executive order on January 20, 2025, regarding "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review" and another one on the same date regarding "Temporary Withdrawal Of All Areas On The Outer Continental Shelf From Offshore Wind Leasing And Review Of The Federal Government’s Leasing And Permitting Practices For Wind Projects" (<image:10756>). USCRI ([https://refugees.org/uscri-summary-of-january-20-executive-orders/](https://refugees.org/uscri-summary-of-january-20-executive-orders/)) provides a summary of Executive Orders released by the White House on January 20, 2025, including an Executive Order Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program, which suspends refugee admissions (<image:10839>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Trump signed executive orders on January 20, 2025. However, none of the provided sources explicitly mention an executive order on that date specifically halting funding to UNRWA. The sources mention executive orders related to rescinding previous orders, gender ideology, regulatory freezes, offshore wind leasing, and refugee admissions.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

**الحقيقة**

هذه الصورة ليست لخاتم الأمين العام لحـ.زب الله الذي اغتالته إسرائيل بغارة جوية مساء الجمعة الماضية، ونشرت مرتين في يناير/ كانون الثاني 2024 لبقايا قائد في الحشـ..ـد الشعبي بالعراق “أبـو تقـوى السعيـدي”، وفي أبريل/ نيسان 2024 وقيل إنها تعود لـ”محمد رضا زاهدي” قائد فيـ.ـلق القدس في سوريا ولبنان.

**كيف تحققنا؟**
---------------

تحقق فريق منصة حقيقة من الصورة المتداولة بأنها لخاتم حسن نصر الله أمين عام حـ.زب الله اللبناني الذي اغتيل بغارة إسرائيلية على مقر الحزب مساء الجمعة الماضية 27 سبتمبر/ أيلول 2024، وتوصل إلى أنها مضللة؛ حيث تم تداول ذات الصورة مرتين خلال عام 2024.

**المرة الأولى** في 5 يناير/ كانون الثاني حيث نشرتها حسابات عراقية، وذكر ناشروها أنها تعود لبقايا قائد في الحشـ..ـد الشعبـ؛ـي بالعراق اسمه “أبـو تقـوى السعيـدي”، والذي قتل في غارة أمريكية على مقر للحشد في بغداد في الرابع من ذات الشهر.

أعلن [حزب الله اللبناني](https://t.me/mmirleb/7378 "حزب الله اللبناني")
 يوم السبت 28.9.2024 عن استشهاد الأمين العام للحزب حسن نصر الله في قصف إسرائيلي يوم الجمعة استهدف الضاحية الجنوبية للعاصمة اللبنانية بيروت، كما وأفادت [وكالة روتيرز](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/middle-east/1744952-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AC%D8%AB%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%95%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%94%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9 " وكالة روتيرز")
 نقلًا عن مصدرين يوم الأحد 29.9.2024 بانتشال جثمان نصر الله من موقع الاستهداف في الضاحية الجنوبية.

ورافقت عملية اغتيال نصر الله مجموعة من المعلومات المضللة والخاطئة، تحقق مرصد كاشف منها. نوضح أبرزها في هذا التقرير.  

**أولاً: انتشار فيديو قديم لحسن نصر الله يتحدث فيه عن طلب السعودية من إسرائيل الحرب على لبنان**
===============================================================================================

نشرت [حسابات](https://x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1805101815618286024 "حسابات")
 على منصة “X” فيديو لكلمة يظهر فيه الأمين العام لحزب الله حسن نصر الله مرفقة بتعليق: “السيد حسن نصر الله زعيم حزب الله اللبناني يصرح بان المملكة العربية السعودية تحرض إسرائيل على ضرب لبنان”.

أحد مصادر الادعاء

تحقق مرصد كاشف من صحة الفيديو من خلال البحث العكسي، ووجد أنه قديم ومقتطع من [خطاب ألقاه نصر الله](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYjeP-j_2-E " خطاب ألقاه نصر الله")
 بتاريخ 10.11.2017، وقال فيه: “أن الأخطر هو تحريض وطلب السعودية من إسرائيل على ضرب لبنان، وحاضرة أن تقدم عشرات مليارات الدولارات مقابل ذلك”. وأضاف في خطابه: “نقلا عن وسائل إعلام إسرائيلية أن حرب تموز 2006 كانت بطلب من السعودية وتحريض سعودي وعندما أرادت إسرائيل وقف الحرب طلبت السعودية الاستمرار فيها حتى القضاء على حزب الله”.

فيديو لخطاب حسن نصر الله نشرته قناة “فرانس 24” بتاريخ 10.11.2017

أحد مصادر الادعاء

تحقق مرصد كاشف من صحة الفيديو من خلال البحث عبر محرك “Google”، ووجد المرصد أن الادعاء مضلل وأن الفيديو رُبط بشكل خاطئ بابنة نصر الله. فالفيديو يعود لفتاة لبنانية تدعى مريم خُضر وليس لزينب ابنة حسن نصر الله.

نشرت مريم خُضر مقطع الفيديو السبت 28/9/2024 عبر حسابها على منصة الإنستغرام “[tab\_yeen](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAieHcKCC6B/ "tab_yeen")
” وهي ترثي فقد حسن نصر الله وأوضحت بالتعليقات في وقت لاحق أنها ليست ابنة حسن نصر الله وهي من المؤيدين له وللمقاومة.

كما ونشرت [فيديو آخر](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAeT6Jhi1O5/ "فيديو آخر")
 أوضحت فيه أن اسمها مريم خُضر وهي ليست ابنة حسن نصر الله ودعت إلى إزالة الفيديوهات المنتشرة بعنوان أن زينب نصر الله ترثي والدها حسن نصر الله.

Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail’in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah’ın yüzükleri mi?
=======================================================================

*    !Picture of Gözde Yel <image:11171>Gözde Yel

Kaynakça :

Hizbullah lideri **Hasan Nasrallah’**ın İsrail saldırısında öldürülmesinin ardından sosyal medyada teyit edilmeden çeşitli dezenformasyonlar yayılmaya başladı. “İsrail’in saldırısında şehit olan Hizbullah Genel Sekreteri Seyyid Hasan Nasrallah’tan geriye kalanlar” notuyla, birkaç yüzüğün fotoğrafı paylaşıldı.

İsrail Savunma Kuvvetleri (IDF), 27 Eylül’de Hizbullah’ın kalesi olarak bilinen Lübnan kenti Dahiye’de 4 binaya yönelik ağır bir hava saldırısı gerçekleştirmişti. İsrail, saldırının Hizbullah ana karargâhına yönelik olduğunu ve Hizbullah lideri Nasrallah’ın hedef alındığını açıklamıştı. 28 Eylül’de de Hizbullah lideri Hasan Nasrallah’ın öldüğü duyurulmuştu. Hizbullah da Nasrallah’ın ölümünü doğrulamıştı.

Nasrallah’ın ölümünün ardından, Nasrallah’a ait olduğu iddia edilen yüzüklerin fotoğrafı paylaşıldı. Yapılan saldırının boyutu çok büyük olduğundan enkazdan yüzüklerin çıkabilmesi şüphe uyandırıcı. İddianın doğru olup olmadığını inceleyelim.

! <image:11172>

Tersine görsel arama yöntemiyle fotoğrafı arattığımızda, fotoğrafın güncel değil, 7 Ocak tarihinde [dolaşımda olduğunu](https://x.com/bbooosf/status/1743925188838744189)
 görüyoruz.

O tarihlerde yapılan paylaşımları okuduğumuzda, yüzüklerin, 4 Ocak 2024’te ABD ordusunun öldürdüğü Nuceba Harekât lideri Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari’ye ait olduğunu anlıyoruz.

Dolayısıyla, fotoğraftaki yüzüklerin Nasrallah’a ait olmadığı anlaşılıyor. Fotoğrafın güncel olduğu iddiası da Nasrallah’ın yüzüklerini gösterdiği iddiası da gerçeği yansıtmıyor.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The website "Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail’in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah’ın yüzükleri mi?" discusses an image of rings and a piece of paper, claiming they belonged to Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah after an Israeli airstrike. The article states that the image was circulating on social media after Nasrallah's death. However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo was not recent and was actually from January 7, 2024, and the rings belonged to Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, who was killed by the US military. The article concludes that the claim is false. The article was published on September 30, 2024, and the author is Gözde Yel. <image:10219>, <image:11170>, <image:11172>, <image:11173>.

From [Source](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/): Found exact image on website with title: US takes out al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan
Content: "Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed while standing on the balcony of his safe house in Afghanistan when a CIA drone sent two Hellfire missiles to pulverize the terror leader and plotter of the 9/11 terror attacks.

The precision strike took place in the heart of downtown Kabul during the early hours Saturday, ending a 21-year manhunt for Osama bin Laden’s successor and marking the most significant US counterterror operation since the 2019 slaying of ISIS commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The terror leader had stepped onto his balcony in the Shirpur neighborhood of Kabul when the US drone fired two specially designed RX9 Hellfire missiles dubbed “sword bombs” due to the blades that allow the weapon to tear through metal and walls without destroying entire structures.

President Biden confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death during an evening address in which he declared, “Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more.”

“Now we make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide: If you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,” Biden said.

Biden said of al-Zawahiri, “For decades, he was the mastermind behind the attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more.”

“He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others. He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, American diplomats and American interests.”

 [!Map of drone strike <image:11178> 7](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/kabul-strike-new.jpg "Open a slideshow of all 7 article images.")

The drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death near Kabul.

None of al-Zawahiri’s family members were hurt and there were no civilian casualties, the president said, calling the mission to eliminate the terrorist leader a “total success.”

The president also warned: “To those around the world who have continued to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe.”

Biden’s remarks from the Blue Room balcony of the White House were reminiscent of President Barack Obama’s late-night announcement of the death of bin Laden in Pakistan more than 11 years ago.

“After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents \[George W.\] Bush, Obama and \[Donald\] Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year,” Biden said.

“He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike to remove him from the battlefield once and for all.

“This mission was carefully planned and rigorously to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him.”

Biden added: “We will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone. And we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”

“You know, it can’t be a launching pad against the United States. We’re gonna see to it that won’t happen,” he said.

“This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can and will always make good on that solid, solid pledge.

Fox News, citing two intelligence sources, first reported on the death of the Egyptian-born surgeon who took over the terrorist group behind the Sept. 11 attacks after bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in 2011.

Al-Zawahiri had a $25 million bounty on his head over his indictment in the 1998 embassy bombings.

He’s also believed to have helped coordinate the atrocities that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., 21 years ago, which were masterminded by bin Laden and planned by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, pending trial by a military tribunal.

Current and former officials began hearing Sunday afternoon that he’d been killed in a drone strike, sources told the Associated Press, but the administration delayed releasing the information until his death could be confirmed.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid [confirmed in a statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1554187982407696387)
 Monday that a drone strike on a home in Kabul had taken place the day before.

The house was owned by a top aide to senior Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior intelligence official told AP, raising questions about whether al-Zawahiri had received sanctuary from the Islamist group following the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.

The official added that a CIA ground team and aerial reconnaissance conducted after the drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death.

A senior Biden administration official noted: “Haqqani Taliban members took actions after the strike to conceal Zawahiri’s former presence at the location.”

“We have identified a concerted effort to restrict access to the safe house in the surrounding area for hours after the strike,” the official said.

“The safe house used by Zawahiri is now empty.”

The Taliban spokesman said, “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.

“Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan and the region,” Zabihullah wrote.

“Repeating such actions will damage the available opportunities.”

Al-Zawahiri ascended in al Qaeda after bin Laden was killed in 2011. AP

Al-Zawahiri and bin Laden are believed to have met in the late 1980s, when al-Zawahiri reportedly treated the Saudi millionaire in the caves of Afghanistan as Soviet bombardments shook the mountains around them.

Al-Zawahiri merged his group of Egyptian militants with bin Laden’s al Qaeda in the 1990s, and photos from that period often showed the two men sitting side by side.

Bin Laden provided al Qaeda with charisma and money, but al-Zawahiri brought tactics and organizational skills needed to forge militants into a network of cells in countries around the world.

“The strong contingent of Egyptians \[in al Qaeda\] applied organizational know-how, financial expertise, and military experience to wage a violent jihad against leaders whom the fighters considered to be un-Islamic and their patrons, especially the United States,” Steven A. Cook wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations last year.

There have been rumors of al-Zawahiri’s death for several years, but a video that surfaced in April showed him praising an Indian Muslim woman who had defied a ban on wearing a hijab, or headscarf.

That footage was the first proof in months that he was still alive.

As with bin Laden, al-Zawahiri’s whereabouts had been unknown before the operation that led to his death, though the most common rumors placed him either in Afghanistan or in Pakistan’s near-lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border.

ISWNews Analysis Group: US President Joseph Biden announced the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the recent US drone attack on the Afghan capital.

During a press conference at the White House, US President Joseph Biden claimed that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was killed by the US military and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The assassination operation of Al-Zawahiri was carried out on Saturday, July 31, in three possible places in the city of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.

**

Al-Zawahiri had carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens. Now justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. Our intelligence agencies discovered Ayman al-Zawahiri’s hiding place in the past months. He had moved to Kabul to be with his family members. “After carefully examining the convincing evidence about his position, I ordered precision strike to remove him from the battlefield.”

In this regard, the US media quoted officials of this country as saying that al-Zawahiri was on the balcony of his safe house in Sherpur area in the center of Kabul city when the US drone fired two missiles at him. Other members of his family were present in this building, but they were not harmed and only Al-Zawahiri was killed during this attack.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote in a statement in response to this attack that the recent attack in Kabul was carried out against a residential house in Sherpur area. He added: “The nature of this incident was not clear at first. The security and intelligence organizations of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) investigated the incident and found that the attack was carried out by American drones. The Islamic Emirate condemns this attack for whatever reason it was carried out and considers it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement. These actions repeat the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of America, Afghanistan and the region. Repetition of such actions will harm existing opportunities.”

Ayman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri was an Egyptian-born physician and theologian and the leader of the Islamic Jihad group in Egypt, who after joining Al-Qaeda as the second leader of this terrorist group was persecuted by Western countries, especially the United States. After the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011, Al-Zawahiri took over the leadership of Al-Qaeda.

Al-Zawahiri was opposed to ISIS from the beginning of its establishment, and perhaps one of the reasons for his removal is the creation of differences between the senior members of Al-Qaeda and pushing disaffected forces towards ISIS in Afghanistan and other Central Asian countries. Al-Zawahiri’s assassination will also create problems for America, because they carried out this assassination in Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, and killing a guest is shameful act in the “Pashtun” culture. In addition, there is a possibility that Al-Qaeda will respond to America, and despite the weakening of this group’s organization in recent years, there is enough power to carry out revenge attacks against American positions.

The US planned to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri over a period of several months. On July 31, 2022, two Hellfire missiles fired using a US drone ended the life of the al-Qaeda chief while he was sitting outside in his balcony, mincing him into shreds but without any damage to other individuals.

The CIA officials who were involved in the mission, according to _the Associated Press_, constructed “a pattern of life" and knew that Ayman al-Zawahiri liked sitting on the balcony of his building, which is located in Kabul’s Sherpur area.

Once his daily routine was established by the officials, they presented it to US president Joe Biden in the White House’s Situation Room weeks before the attack.

The officials were also aware that the Haqqani Taliban network provided the housing to Ayman al-Zawahiri and his family in Kabul. The AP reported that Zawahiri’s family along with him started living in the house once the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021.

People familiar with the developments told _CNNNews18_ that the building is close to Iranian and Turkish embassies.

After the US officials confirmed these details, they took more months to formulate an action plan. Several independent teams of analysts were brought on board to ensure that nearby civilians and infrastructure should not be targeted.

Another official familiar with the developments said that the now deceased al-Qaeda leader’s identity was verified on multiple occasions and for sustained periods of time before getting approval for the attack.

The plans were first formed in early April when two senior national security officials were first briefed on the intelligence. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan was then apprised of the developments. Over the next two months, a small group of officials of the US government vetted the intel and devised options for US president Biden.

Biden, when apprised of the developments in July, shortly after he returned from his Europe trip, bombarded CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and National Counterterrorism Centre director Christy Abizaid regarding the accuracy of the data presented to him.

Biden made it clear that the attack should not lead to results like the 2021 drone attack that ended up killing civilians in Kabul. He also said that Afghans who helped the US should not be in jeopardy.

Biden gave the go-ahead after July 25, while he was recovering from Covid .

The success of the attack was confirmed when the Haqqani Taliban network restricted access to the safe house and relocated Zawahiri’s family.

“I authorized the precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This measure was carefully planned, rigorously, to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians," Biden said in his address where he confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader, who headed the terrorist group for more than a decade, was eliminated.

Greta Thunberg was seen with a placard that read "Stand with Gaza"

**New Delhi:**

Climate activist Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza has drawn a sharp response from Israel. On Friday, Greta posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, in which four activists, including herself, held placards expressing solidarity with Palestine and Gaza.

Reacting to Ms Thunberg's post, Israel, through its official X handle, took a dig at the climate activist saying that Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets, "which have butchered innocent Israelis".

"The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up,” the post added

Israel also used pictures of three 19-year-old Israelis, who were killed allegedly in a Hamas attack.

The response came after Ms Thunberg, in her post, was seen with a placard that read, "Stand with Gaza."

Another activist called for a "Free Palestine," while two other women held placards with messages, "This Jew supports Palestine" and "Climate justice now!"

“Week 270. Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected,” Greta Thunberg wrote in the caption.

Some users, however, came to Ms Thunberg's defense. They pointed out that her expression of support was for Gaza, not necessarily for Hamas. One user wrote, “Your subconscious and true ideals leaked. She said Gaza, not Hamas. This says a lot. good luck editing this next.”

Another person accused Israel of “playing the victim card.”

A user accused Israel of similar actions and brought up concerns about the environmental sustainability of the air and watercraft used by the IDF in the context of restricting movement and impacting Palestinians in the region. “The air and watercrafts used by the IDF to restrict movement and BUTCHER innocent Palestinians in the largest open-air prison for 75 years aren't made of sustainable materials,” read the comment.

Ms Thunberg's statement came 270 weeks after she initiated her Friday school strike, which later ignited the global school strikes movement.

The United Nations revealed that in just 10 days, around 4,200 people have lost their lives and more than a million people have been forced to leave their homes due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Greta Thunberg — from climate warrior to Israel hater
=====================================================

Thunberg's stance on the Middle East conflict sparks division within the global climate movement, as many activists question its relevance to environmental advocacy

Greta Thunberg brought millions out onto the world’s streets to protest for a greener future. Demonstrating against companies polluting the planet in a variety of countries, she was arrested multiple times. Since Hamas’ brutal October 7 terrorist attack, the Swedish activist has redirected much of her rage toward Israel.

She wears a keffiyeh, poses with Palestinian flags and accuses Israel of "genocide," while largely ignoring Qatar, which, for years, has been transferring to Hamas funds derived from its oil and natural gas sales profits. Paradoxically, burning these fuels emits greenhouse gases, a contributing factor to global warming - the very issue Thunberg has been protesting for years.

At demonstrations, she calls to "Free Palestine," stop arming Israel and impose a permanent ceasefire on the country. She rarely, if ever, demands the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza or condemns the terrorist attack that triggered the war.

Demonstrating against Israel being her first priority, Thunberg didn’t even bother attending either the 2023 climate conference held in Dubai or that of 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The climate activist has turned her back on her supporters, and alongside her relentless anti-Israel campaigning, has also sparked anger in other arenas.

Thunberg visited Turkey’s Kurdish regions last November, evoking outrage in the country for condemning Erdogan’s government. She criticized the environmental destruction in Kurdish-populated areas. "Destruction and exploitation of nature – such as unlawful forest cutdowns, sacrificing zones for mining companies and fires – is one of the many tools used as part of the continuous attacks against the Kurds. This often leads to devastation of local communities and biodiversity as well as forced displacement."

On an X posting, she then called on Turkey to amend its treatment of the Kurds. "Turkey must clarify its stance on the Kurds and other minority groups by enshrining their rights in the constitution." She went on to write, "The government continues to use ‘terrorism’ as a pretext to silence its political opponents. Tens of thousands of politically active individuals remain imprisoned without fair trials. International organizations such as the ECHR, UN, and Amnesty have condemned this and called for their release. For a sustainable peace and a just future, the Kurds’ right to freedom and autonomy must be respected and the violent attacks against Kurdistan must end."

After causing ire in Turkey, she moved on to voice her support for independence for Western Sahara, provoking fury in Morocco. She posed with the Western Sahara flag, championing the region’s struggle for justice and human rights. She said it was unacceptable for the international community to ignore the situation in Western Sahara and called for global action toward a just resolution.

This too is a political struggle, in no way related to climate issues. She’s also condemned the Azerbaijani government, accusing it of "ethnic cleansing" and further crimes against Armenians, and has protested against Georgia’s government, advocating "Justice, freedom and democracy," amid the country’s political crisis.

And if you’d thought Thunberg had given up on her anti-Israel activism, you’d be wrong. She continues posting images of Palestinian flags and protest signs in support of Gazans from her weekly demonstrations in Stockholm. Last month, she returned to Denmark, where she took part in a violent protest against the Maersk shipping company.

Along with further anti-Israel activists, Thunberg disrupted activity at the company’s headquarters, claiming it was using its ships to transport weapons to Israel. She called on the company to cancel all contracts and investments related to what she termed "Genocide and occupation of Palestine." Thunberg was arrested along with around two dozen more protesters who were all released shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, she regularly shares anti-Israel messages urging her 14 million Instagram followers, and millions more on other social media platforms, to demonstrate and take action against Israel.

Thunberg is the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and opera singer Malena Ernman who represented Sweden in Eurovision 2009. At age 15, in the summer of 2018, Greta started a one-woman protest outside the Swedish parliament. She would show up every Friday with a small sign reading, "Skolstrejk för klimatet" (School Strike for Climate) She was slowly but surely joined by more teenagers and, in time, mobilized masses worldwide to take to the streets to protest the climate crisis. She met with numerous world leaders and took part in demonstrations across the globe.

Her protest peaked the following September with millions of young people flooding the streets of major cities worldwide and staging climate marches. Thunberg led hundreds of thousands in a climate demonstration in New York City, making the journey to America by solar-powered boat, averting the greenhouse gas emissions of a transatlantic flight.

That same month, Thunberg even expressed solidarity with Israel, tweeting a photo of climate supporters in Tel Aviv - only to be met with backlash. Despite talk backers angrily asking, "How dare you?”, she left up the posting.

Greta Thunberg on the cover of Time Magazine

Thunberg was named Time Magazine's 2019 Person of the Year. Then - and current - US President Donald Trump, whom Thunberg had stared down at the UN building in New York, mocked her, tweeting, "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"

Thunberg has even received several Nobel Peace Prize nominations for her climate activism. The committee went for other candidates.

Israeli social media users also expressed their indignation, arguing that her statements essentially amounted to support for Hamas. One user, "@hasolidit," remarked: "Autistic children were murdered by Hamas and singled out as legitimate military targets solely because they were Israeli Jews. Your failure to even acknowledge that is proof of your rabid antisemitism. Not your stupid stuffed animal," referring to a toy octopus appearing in one of Thunberg’s posts, interpreted by some as an antisemitic symbol.

Thunberg didn’t stop at anti-Israel posts, but rather brought her anti-Israel activism to her weekly protests outside the Swedish parliament. Three weeks following the massacre, the Swedish activist stood alongside anti-Israel placards declaring, "Free Palestine," and, "Stop the Holocaust," and she herself held a sign reading, "Justice for Palestine."

> Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change

Criticism of Thunberg has also emerged on the global stage with Fridays for Future (FFF) leaders in Germany, Austria, and even in her homeland of Sweden, distancing themselves from her October 20 post featuring signs supporting the Palestinians, while ignoring the Hamas massacre. Israeli teens have also lashed out at Thunberg, turning her from a role model to a resented figure.

Thunberg’s controversial stance has meant the global climate movement, which had enjoyed widespread consensus support, has found itself divided around a conflict many of its advocates don’t understand, and certainly has nothing to do with environmentalism.

Thunberg has become fixated on the Palestinian issue. At rallies, rather than talking about global warming, the climate crisis, pollution killing millions every year, or countries (such as Iran, Iraq, and Qatar) still producing oil, she has repeatedly spoken out against Israel.

At a rally in Amsterdam November 2023, a man approached her on stage and said that he had come to an environmental, not political, event. The man was forcibly removed from the stage as Thunberg declared to the crowd, "No climate justice on occupied land."

Palestinian flags were waved in the crowd and Thunberg was spotted donning a keffiyeh. In an effort to clarify her stance, she said, “As a climate justice movement, we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and for justice. Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity.” She, again, in no way addressed the Hamas terrorist attack that sparked the war. Why? Maybe, it was convenient for her to overlook the murderous attack so as to stand alongside Gazan civilians, some of whom, as it turns out, assisted the terrorists, hiding hostages in their homes or concealing weapons and terrorists.

Amsterdam wasn’t the end of it. Thunberg continued her scathing anti-Israel rhetoric, undoubtedly to the delight of Tehran, Doha, and Hamas leaders in hiding. At a pro-Palestinian in Stockholm in November 2023, she called to "Crush Zionism."

Throughout this time, she carried on wearing a keffiyeh around her neck, posing with anti-Israel protest signs and Palestinian flags and accusing Israel of "genocide" in Gaza. In Malmo, Sweden, last May, she showed up at the Eurovision Song Contest, an event officially defined as non-political. Here, she took part in a protest and was arrested for disturbing the peace. Photos from the scene showed her, with a keffiyeh wrapped around her neck, being dragged away by two police officers. At this demonstration, Palestinian flags were waved and slogans were chanted against Israel and then President Joe Biden. She was arrested once more a few months later, this time in Copenhagen, again at an anti-Israel rally,

Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change. The young woman who once drew millions globally against corporations polluting the environment and fought for a better future has now abandoned the cause she spearheaded. Her role has shifted from that of a leader enjoying global consensus to a divisive figure, ignoring the crimes of Hamas terrorists who raped, murdered and kidnapped Israelis on October 7.

The past 18 months have witnessed almost no large-scale demonstrations against climate change, but rather modest protests numbering in the dozens or hundreds. Trump is back in the White House and, unlike during his previous term of office, when climate activists under Thunberg’s leadership were taking to the streets en masse, the U.S. president’s anti-environment measures are passing rather quietly as world leaders are acting slowly if at all. And it looks like no one can lead the global climate protest like the old Greta Thunberg could.

Greta stands with Gaza
======================

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E)

Greta Thunberg's 'stand with Gaza' is a historic moment for the global climate movement.

> .

Greta Thunberg posted the picture below on her X account during a week of climate and peace protests in London recently. Many people in the press criticised her because they themselves supported the Israeli bombing and opposed a ceasefire. 

_Medical Aid for Palestinians is responding to the current emergency in Gaza. It has launched an emergency appeal to 'ensure that Palestinian health workers have the medical resources they need, as soon as possible'. You can donate to the appeal_ [_online_](https://www.map.org.uk/donate/donation-details/484)
_._ 

Some of those people called her, ludicrously, antisemitic, because a toy octopus appeared in the first image she used. There was also criticism from some climate activists in Germany, Austria and Israel. Beyond that, there was little open criticism from the climate movement, and much support on social media.

This is a historic moment for the global climate movement. This article explains why. The photo reminded us of Martin Luther King’s speech on the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on 4 April 1967. 

**Questions**

King had maintained a public silence on the war for the two years after President Johnson sent 500,000 troops to Vietnam. Now he broke that silence to call for peace and American withdrawal.

_Nancy and Jonathan have recently published_ Why Men? A Global History of Violence and Inequality _(Hurst, 2023)._ [_Order a copy now_](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/why-men/)
_._

Many of his advisers, and many liberals had urged him not to speak out, saying that it would split the civil rights movement and turn President Johnson’s government against them.

King went ahead. In an eloquent and closely argued speech, he said that he had been urging nonviolence on young African Americans rioters. They had replied to him with a question: What about Vietnam?  

"Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today—my own government.

"For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent."

**Greatest**

King’s courage strengthened opposition to the war, particularly among Black Americans, and especially among Black American soldiers. But the effect of his words went far wider as well.

King also told the truth – the war was racist. And it was the same racism that characterised American society. And by telling the truth King saved his own integrity.

Greta's speaking style is very different from King’s. He was the greatest rhetorical speaker in America in the twentieth century. He reached for the strongest effects, for metaphors and the rolling rhythms of Southern preachers and gospel music.

Greta is a master of plain speech. Her longest speeches are short, clear and passionate. Her X posts are compact, honest, devastating. And in this picture there are only twelve words. But together they carry a complex argument.

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/greta-gaza-2%20%281%29_0.jpg)

Each face tells a story, and each tells a different story.

**Radical**

Look again at the four young women. Greta holds a sign that says “Stand With Gaza”. Because she is instantly recognizable, the most important leader in the climate movement, this carries a message: The whole climate movement should support Palestine. 

It’s a call for change. And she is choosing her words carefully: Stand With Gaza. Not peace, not ceasefire - though she supports both. 

But no, solidarity is the starting point. Behind her another young woman holds two words: ‘Climate Justice Now’. She is saying this is about climate. And this is about justice. 

As with King, we cannot talk about climate justice if we do not support the most important issue of social justice in the world right now. A third woman holds two words: “Free Palestine”.

They are written on a piece of paper, or cardboard, on which someone has painted the colours of the Palestinian flag. Again, that means peace, but far more. This is an intervention on the radical side of the issue.

**Moral**

The fourth woman has five words: “This Jew Stands With Palestine.” Our solidarity is not antisemitism. Take a moment to look at those expressions again.

This picture, these four women, are a response to a moral imperative. This is a response to a unfolding great atrocity. That is the most important matter here, and that is enough. But this solidarity is also historically important for the climate movement. Here is why.

This is a change. All through the days of the mass school strikes, Greta insisted that the movement had to be non-political. For example, she refused to support a Green New Deal because it would split the movement. She did not then comment on matters beyond climate.

This made sense to her, as it made sense to many people in the climate movement. And on some level, she may still have hoped against hope for action by the politicians. Then two things happened. 

First, in October 2019 Thunberg called for adults to join the school students on strike. She said that if they did not, the students could not win. Large numbers of trade unionists did strike in Germany and Australia, but nowhere else.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion was clear. Greater power was needed. Only a global movement for social justice in all its forms could deliver that. The other conclusion was that the leaders of the world would not act. Form the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021 she sent two tweets that condensed the argument. 

One was “Blah, blah, blah. F\*\*\* you.” The other was “Uproot the system”. Gaza matters because of seventy-five years of suffering, and because human beings, children, women and men are dying there in great numbers.

But those are not the only reasons why so many people have marched in solidarity in so many countries. This is also a great public racist massacre. This is the racism of centuries of white supremacy made murderous flesh again.

People know this, all over the world. It is why African Americans and people of colour are so central to the marches in the United States, and why all the thirteen representatives in the US Congress who have called for a ceasefire are people of colour.

Most people in Africa, Asia and Latin America know this too. But so do many, many white people in Europe and North America. So do people in the Middle East, acutely, in their guts, enraged and in sorrow. And so, as we have seen, do many Jewish people in New York, Washington and Tel Aviv.

**Future**

This is why the movement has been so enormous. We want to rid the world of racism and we are saying every human matters. The scale of these movements has frightened the governments of the world. That is why the secretary general of the United Nations and most of the governments of the world have called for a ceasefire.

This is where the future of Palestine, the future of the climate movement and the future of humanity come together. For one thing, climate change will bring us many massacres like Gaza's, many punishments of refugee camps. 

Runaway climate change will cover the world with walls, camps, barbed wire, hungry refugees and government massacres. The fight against such a future starts now. But there’s more. Pakistan has at least housed many refugees for decades. 

Almost all of Europe is far worse, and there hatred of refugees fuels racism and a turn to the far right. But also, we know by now that we cannot stop climate change without a massive, committed climate movement across the world, willing to take power to save us all.  

We cannot do that without the active support of the majority of workers and peasants in Africa, Latin America and Asia. There are many reasons. The people in the poorer countries of the Global South are 80 per cent of humanity. 

**Horror**

Back in 2019 those countries already produced 62 per cent of global fossil fuel emissions. Soon enough they will produce two-thirds. That means we cannot stop climate change unless the people in those countries insist upon an economy that brings them a decent standard of living through renewable energy.

Moreover, the great social movements of the last hundred century strongest, and most important in the countries of the Global South. After all, that is where people have suffered most. 

And since the Arab Spring, and all the great movements against dictatorship, the social movements have again been strongest in the South. And the impact, the horror, of climate change will be worst in the South. 

The movements in Europe and North America still matter. We write this in England, and Thunberg made that photo in Sweden. And people in the South will not stop climate change if the North refuses to do so. 

**Turning**

We are all in this together. But what happens in the South will matter more. That is why standing with Gaza against racism matters for the future of the climate movement. But there is another link. To stand with Gaza is to stand with life against death. 

To stand against climate change is to do the same on a far larger scale. This photo, just a photo, is a moment in human history. By contrast, Gaza is the most important issue in the world right now. 

But this is also a turning point in the climate movement. There will be many more horrors. We are embarked on the mother of all struggles to save each other and all living things. 

There will be many more such moments, and some of them will be even worse. But the direction of change for the climate movement is becoming clear. Like the signs say: stand with Gaza - climate justice now!.

Thunberg, who is among hundreds of people from 44 countries on the flotilla, hopes their mission will bring symbolic aid and help open up a humanitarian corridor to deliver more aid.

She said the activists' goal is to send "hope and solidarity to the people of Gaza, showing a clear signal that the world has not forgotten about you".

Greta Thunberg has rejected accusations of antisemitism as she embarks on her second flotilla to Gaza.

The 22-year-old and other activists are setting sail on the largest flotilla to Gaza on Sunday, despite having been detained by Israeli forces and deported when they approached on a British-flagged yacht in June.

Israel later accused the group of activists of being antisemitic - an accusation Thunberg told Sky News' [**Europe correspondent Siobhan Robbins**](https://news.sky.com/author/siobhan-robbins-667)
 she rejects.

"It is not antisemitic to say that we should not be bombing people, that one should not be living in occupation, that everyone should have the right to live in freedom and dignity, no matter who you are," she said.

Before the dozens of boats carrying aid embarks from Spain, the activists called on governments to pressure Israel to allow their flotilla through the naval blockade.

Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control of the coastal enclave in 2007 and has blocked numerous attempts to reach Gaza since, including a vessel in 2010 by its special forces in which at least nine Turkish activists were killed.

But Thunberg brushed concerns about the dangers of the trip aside, saying she was instead worried about the "silence of the world" in light of what is happening in Gaza.

"I'm terrified to see that we seem to have lost all the humanity that we have, and there seems to be no compassion left in the world amongst the vast majority of people who are able to sit on the couch and watch the genocide unfold that I am terrified for," she added.

Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide and previously described the first ship, Madleen, as "the selfie yacht", dismissing the aid ship as a propaganda stunt in support of Hamas.

In a statement to Sky News, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said: "The IDF enforces the security naval blockade on the Gaza Strip and is prepared for a wide range of scenarios, which it will act upon in accordance with the directives of the political echelon."

Thunberg said: "It's important that by doing so, by continuing this blockade, Israel is violating international law. And what we are trying to do is to use our rights to sail on international waters and to deliver humanitarian aid, which Israel is not allowed to block from coming in."

Asked what would be her message to Hamas, which is still holding 48 hostages in Gaza, around 20 of whom Israel still believes to be alive, Thunberg said she does "not stand behind killing civilians".

"But we translate that into reality and we're seeing how many hundreds of thousands of people are dying in Gaza now, how many hundreds of thousands of people have been deprived \[of\] their dignity and justice and freedom by Israel," she added.

The naval blockade has remained in place through conflicts, including the current war, which began when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.

Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has since killed almost 63,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while part of the Strip is suffering from famine, according to a global hunger monitor - something Israel denies.

In March, Israel also sealed off Gaza by land, not letting in supplies for three months, claiming Hamas was diverting aid.

The IDF said in its statement: "Israel allows and facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip."

Israel ''did an illegal act by kidnapping us,'' says Greta Thunberg

Israel says it has deported Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, a day after the Gaza-bound aid boat she and 11 other people were on was intercepted by Israeli forces in the Mediterranean.

Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning on a flight to France after she agreed to be deported, the Israeli foreign ministry said.

Upon arriving at an airport in Paris, Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and other activists on the boat while they were in international waters.

France said five of the six French citizens detained alongside her had refused to sign their deportation orders and would now be subject to judicial proceedings.

Thunberg arrives in Paris

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), the activist group operating the yacht The Madleen, has demanded the immediate release of everyone detained.

The vessel was intercepted early on Monday while the activists tried to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's maritime blockade and highlight the humanitarian crisis there.

The Israeli foreign ministry dismissed it as a "selfie yacht", and announced in a post on X on Monday night that the passengers had been transferred to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport following the vessel's arrival at the port of Ashdod on Monday night.

"Those who refuse to sign deportation documents and leave Israel will be brought before a judicial authority, in accordance with Israeli law, to authorize their deportation," it said.

On Tuesday morning, the ministry said Thunberg had "just departed Israel on a flight to Sweden (via France)", and [posted a photo of her sitting on a plane](https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1932337642886021543)
.

Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport, Thunberg said Israel had committed "an illegal act by kidnapping us on international waters and against our will, bringing us to Israel, keeping us in the bottom of the boat, not letting us getting out and so on".

She added: "But that is not the real story here, the real story is that there is a genocide going on in Gaza, and a systematic starvation following the siege and blockade now, which is leading to food, medicine, water - that are desperately needed to get into Gaza - is prevented from doing so."

The Israeli foreign ministry has insisted the blockade was "consistent with international law", and that unauthorised attempts to breach it were "dangerous, unlawful, and undermine ongoing humanitarian efforts".

Asked why she was free while others were still detained, Thunberg said it was "a bit unclear". <image:11406>!Reuters Swedish activist Greta Thunberg walks inside a terminal surrounded by journalists and French police at the Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Their kidnapping is unlawful and a violation of international law," it added.

Israel's foreign ministry said the aid, which includes baby formula and medicine, would be transferred to Gaza "through real humanitarian channels".

The FFC said the Madleen was intercepted by the Israeli military inside international waters about 185km (115 miles) west of Gaza early on Monday.

According to the group, the vessel was surrounded by quadcopter drones, sprayed with a "white irritant substance", and had its communications jammed.

Video footage released by the group showed the passengers sitting down with their hands raised as Israeli forces boarded.

It also posted [a pre-recorded clip showing Thunberg saying](https://x.com/GazaFFlotilla/status/1931886800634818871)
: "If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by Israeli occupational forces or forces that support Israel."

"I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible."

The foreign ministry later said all the passengers were "safe and unharmed", and posted a video showing troops handing them food and water.

! She said she and some others had signed a document saying they wanted to go back as soon as they could, but did not accept they had entered the country illegally, but others hadn't signed this document.

She added she had been unable to say goodbye to fellow activists before her deportation, and was unsure what was happening to them. "I'm very worried about them," she said.

France's Foreign Minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, earlier wrote on X: "Our consul was able to see the six French nationals arrested by the Israeli authorities last night."

"One of them has agreed to leave voluntarily and should return today. It left the Italian city of Catania on 1 June and was intercepted by Israeli forces on 9 June, near the Ashdod port. <image:11409>

When the Madleen set sail from Italy on 1 June, the FFC said it was "carrying humanitarian aid and international human rights defenders in direct defiance of Israel's illegal and genocidal blockade". The Israeli foreign ministry called it a "gimmick", while Israel has rejected accusations of genocide.

On Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the maritime blockade was necessary to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hamas.

Israel and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Gaza when Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections.

Israel stopped all deliveries of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March this year and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.

It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the group to release the hostages still held in Gaza, but the UN warned that Gaza's 2.1 million population were facing catastrophic levels of hunger because of the resulting shortages of food.

Three weeks ago, Israel launched an expanded offensive to take control of all areas of Gaza. It also partially eased the blockade, allowing in a "basic" amount of food.

Israel is now prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which it backs along with the US."

AP AUDIO: Israel deports Greta Thunberg after Gaza-bound ship she was on was seized

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Israel’s foreign ministry says activist Greta Thunberg has been deported from the country.

On Monday, U.S. The activists were held separately and some had trouble accessing lawyers, she added.

Asked why she agreed to deportation, she said, “Why would I want to stay in an Israeli prison more than necessary?”

Thunberg called on supporters to ask their governments “to demand not only humanitarian aid being let into Gaza but most importantly an end to the occupation and an end to the systemic oppression and violence that Palestinians are facing on an everyday basis.”

She said recognizing Palestine is “the very, very, very minimum” that governments can do to help.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:11442>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep. Pingback: [James Baldwin on Black-Jewish Relations, Israel and the United States – Tony Greenstein demo](https://demo.tonygreenstein.com/james-baldwin-on-black-jewish-relations-israel-and-the-united-states/)
    
8. 

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

The U.S. Indeed, an unknown number of Texans make their way back to Lebanon each year to reconnect with family and friends – and for business, too.

But as fighting between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has intensified – with civilian casualties mounting, especially in Beirut and southern Lebanon – teams with the U.S. citizens assistance](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/crisis-intake)
 in three ways:

• Connecting with commercially available flights running through Middle East Airlines, the primary carrier out of Lebanon.

• Putting on some extra flights to ensure greater seating capacity for U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who’d like to depart.

• Offering short-term emergency loans for those who want to stay in the country but move to a safer area.

“Our whole goal here throughout the entire event is to get American citizens from a place of danger to a place of safety,” Kerwin said.

Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon have forced more and more people from their homes. government flights for people to depart as well - for American citizens and family members to depart to safe locations. And between those two things, the flight - the seat blocking and the flights that we have organized, we've increased availability for American citizens to depart by about 1,800 seats in just the last few days.

One thing I should mention is that we still have a lot of capacity on these flights. I want to mention one other thing...

SUMMERS: Right.

BITTER: ...That we're doing in Lebanon, which we've never done before, which is we are offering loans.

SUMMERS: Rena, I think the connection's a little choppy. We are in touch with about 8,000 Americans, a little bit more, who are seeking our assistance - some to depart, but not all to depart - and I did mention these loans.

SUMMERS: Right.

BITTER: And we want American citizens to leave, but we recognize that some of them may choose to stay, and this is an opportunity for them to be able to...

SUMMERS: OK.

BITTER: ...Get through some challenging times.

SUMMERS: Rena, is an evacuation, such as the one that the United States had from Afghanistan back on 2021, on the table at this point?

BITTER: You know, as I mentioned at the beginning, the commercial airport is open, and there are - there's commercial aviation flying. We are asking Americans to fill a promissory note for their spot on these flights. Are you able to share any more information about that or the status, generally, of Americans who are still in the country?

BITTER: Right. Accessibility links

U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon this week during escalated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah

.

Other countries, from Greece to the United Kingdom, Japan and Colombia, have arranged flights or sent military planes to ferry out their citizens.

As Israeli bombardments targeting senior Hezbollah leaders shook southern neighborhoods in Lebanon's capital last week, “We could still see, hear and feel everything” despite fleeing to the mountains outside Beirut, said Nicolette Hutcherson, a longtime humanitarian volunteer living in Lebanon with her husband and three children.

The only seats Hutcherson's family could find on commercial carriers were for flights weeks away and for thousands of dollars, she said. Family members said he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

“He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,” she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising them to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said relatives who are U.S. Limits on withdrawing money from banks due to [Lebanon’s longstanding economic collapse](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-war-economy-d5433642fcfce79facf8a1369b14d0f0)
 and intermittent electricity and internet have made it difficult, they said.

Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a lawyer based in Washington, paid $5,000 to get a female relative on the last seat of a flight out of Beirut on Saturday.

“She was on her way to the airport” when Israeli began one of its first days of intensified bombing, Abou-Chedid said.

By Thursday, some Americans said their loved ones had been able to secure tickets for upcoming flights and were hopeful.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon’s flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

Miller said the embassy is prepared to offer temporary loans to Americans who choose to remain in Lebanon but want to relocate to a potentially safer area of the country.

 toward Israel, leaving the region bracing for any Israeli retaliation and fearing an all-out regional war.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, attacked Israel on Oct."

The evidence confirms that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024. It also confirms that the U.S. government arranged chartered flights for American citizens out of Israel in October 2023.

The evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights. The search results focus on the evacuation of American citizens.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the part about flying Israeli citizens is not supported by the evidence.

Charter flights were organized by not-for-profits. Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens. The U.S. State Department placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory. Ron DeSantis landed in Tampa, Florida, carrying hundreds of Americans.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024. It also confirms that the U.S. government arranged chartered flights for American citizens out of Israel in October 2023.

The evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights. The search results focus on the evacuation of American citizens.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the part about flying Israeli citizens is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon and arranged chartered flights for American citizens out of Israel. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights.

`false`

## Summary

The U.S. government is providing assistance to Americans in Lebanon, including loans for flights, as tensions escalate in October 2024, as reported by [The Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel/).

Israel declares ‘state of war’ after Hamas militants launch surprise attack from Gaza (videos)

Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel  on Saturday morning, October 7 in a surprise assault as several gunmen crossed into different Israeli towns while a heavy barrage of rockets are fired from the Gaza Strip.

As at press time, warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem.

At least 40 people have been killed since Hamas launched the surprise attack on Israel, the country’s emergency service said.

Another 779 people have been wounded, according to the Israeli Health Ministry.

  
Israel’s military said it was on a war footing and the defense minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a “grave mistake” by declaring war on Israel, in retaliation, Israeli military launched air strikes into Gaza.

  
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said Hamas had “launched a war against the State of Israel”. Israeli “troops are fighting against the enemy at every location”, he said.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313160-1696661234669-gettyimages-1711150149-20090101231007-911-002189_1696674381.jpeg)

  
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.

> “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel’s police chief said there were “21 active scenes” in southern Israel.

  
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of war ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

  
Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313161-1696664544161-gettyimages-1711245488-AFP_33XP63Y_1696674371.jpeg)

  
“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from a Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said militants had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.

>   
> “They just came in again, please send help,” she said. “There are a lot of homes harmed … My husband is holding the door closed … They are firing rounds of bullets.”

Palestinian media reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.

  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in  a speech this morning said the country was in war. His office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours.

  
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.

  
“We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,” said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.

  
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

Another video appeared to a crowd of Palestinian men dancing around and on top of a burning Israeli tank. The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to meet with his top security officials on Saturday morning.  <br>>   <br>> Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the “element of surprise” in the early morning attack which appeared to involve Palestinian fighters in trucks inside Israel and on paragliders, in addition to the rocket fire, will leave Israelis “shocked and stunned”.<br><br>  <br>[SOURCE](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports)<br><br>**10 Likes** **3 Shares**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740638_img20231007063148_jpeg0756aad4954d77978ecd178fbbf6930c)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740639_screenmaster20231007063416_jpeg8a2723256f4e323049af97dfa8770b6f)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740640_img20231007064058_jpeg7dcde991e6026c7a8397b6e3a5f2cf93)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740641_img20231007064203_jpeg6ab49057eb636386ec9a67b195b39b00) |

| I want to believe no terrorist will moan when the mighty hand of Israel hit them hard. I've always said it, these religious lot are nothing but a bunch of barbarians. Give 'em an inch and they'll sink your country like the Titanic. Just look at what's been going on up north in Nigeria. The whole point of their religion seems to be causing trouble and chaos, so it's no surprise that their followers are just as bad.  <br>  <br>They're a bunch of hypocrites, aren't they? They blow things up, run and hide, then come out crying when the Israelis strike back. They use civilians as human shields, the bloody cowards! It's like they have no shame. All they know how to do is make trouble, then play the victim when things go south. They're a bunch of chancers, the lot of them. Bloody cowards!  <br>  <br>I 'ope these ruddy terrorists know that the Israelis don't muck about when it comes to lookin' out for their own. If any of their Yank cousins got caught up in it, it'd be a right proper problem for them. I think they've forgotten about what happened in Munich, and the consequences after that. This could be right nasty, if you get my drift.

The Israeli military has carried out intense bombardment in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 17 people hours after forcing residents in the area to leave again during its third ground assault on the densely populated camp in northern Gaza since launching the war a year ago.

The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said [on Sunday](/news/liveblog/2024/10/6/live-israel-carries-out-very-violent-bombing-campaign-on-beirut)
 that the death toll included nine children following air attacks and as the army deployed tanks into the area for the first time in months.

The Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson in Gaza, Mahmoud Basal, added that Jabalia was targeted with multiple strikes overnight, resulting in many casualties. It felt like the early days of the war,” Raed, 52, from Jabalia, told the Reuters news agency before his family left for Gaza City on Sunday.

On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said its forces had “successfully” encircled the refugee camp and were operating in the area.

The army said the decision was taken after intelligence indicated the “presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia … as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area”.

Israel has destroyed hospitals, schools and residential areas, claiming Hamas was operating under them but providing no proof of its claims. Rights organisations say these attacks amount to war crimes.

Meanwhile, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said its fighters have targeted “a command and control room” belonging to Israeli forces who were trying to get into Jabalia refugee camp.

‘Deteriorating’ situation
-------------------------

Reporting from near the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, journalist Moath al-Kahlout said that the situation in the north was “deteriorating”, adding that an “entire family” had been killed in the overnight attacks.

“The Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering people to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. This may lead to more civilian deaths and injuries,” he said.

Military and security analyst Elijah Magnier says Israel’s renewed ground invasion of northern Gaza was “inevitable” as far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Palestinian armed resistance groups had recruited “more than a thousand people”.

“Israelis have returned to Gaza several times, they’ve returned to the north several times, they’ve destroyed the infrastructure, the hospitals, everything,” Magnier told Al Jazeera.

“They will continue doing so unless \[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\] Netanyahu stops this war.”

(Al Jazeera)

Evacuation orders
-----------------

The Israeli army has called on Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to designated “safe zones” in southern and central Gaza as it begins a renewed ground offensive. Residents in Jabalia have described the intensified attacks as some of the worst in months.

“Dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings. But no place in Gaza is safe for Palestinians, including the so-called “safe zones”, campaigners say.

But as some Palestinians begin making the journey southwards, Gaza’s Interior Ministry has called on residents to ignore Israel’s evacuation orders.

“Israeli claims about the presence of safe zones in southern Gaza are lies as Israel commits crimes and massacres in all areas of the enclave,” the ministry said in a statement.

“We call on citizens in northern Gaza to ignore Israeli threats.”

Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the difference this time, compared to earlier evacuation orders, is that it is “not only blocks but whole areas”.

“Some of those Palestinians who were in the north have refused to evacuate despite the attacks and also the starvation and harsh conditions the blockade has imposed on them. They still refuse to leave,” Khoudary said.

She added that a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also targeted in Sunday’s strikes and was killed.

According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured since the war began on October 7.

Men used an improvised splint to evacuate an injured woman from Jabalia camp on Wednesday

Amid gunfire and Israeli artillery shelling, Palestinian medics say that they have begun moving premature babies and other patients away from Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia refugee camp, as troops and tanks encircle it.

The Israeli military has been carrying out its third ground offensive in the area since the war in Gaza began, saying it is targeting regrouping Hamas fighters who aim to launch attacks.

Two other local hospitals are virtually inaccessible and face evacuation orders, Gazan health officials say.

Dozens of people are reported to have been killed and wounded in the north in recent days.

The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said on Monday that its first responders had recovered the bodies of 15 people following an Israeli strike on a tented camp for displaced people next to the al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had "struck terrorists operating within a command-and-control centre embedded in an area in Jabalia that previously served as a medical compound", and that it had taken steps to mitigate harm to civilians.

The Civil Defence also said five people were killed in a strike on a family home in the camp, which had more than 110,000 registered residents before the war.

Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned that its own shelters and services were being forced to shut.

“With almost no basic supplies available, hunger is spreading and deepening again,” Philippe Lazzarini said, adding that the second phase of the polio vaccination campaign for children in Gaza was also threatened.

Residents have been speaking to the BBC about their fear and desperation.

“I have been displaced more than 10 times.

! Men, women, and children ask, ‘Where do we go?’ and the answer is, ‘I don’t know,’” said Bilal al-Amreeti, a local man.

“The sound of Israeli warplanes is above us, there is bombing, and the shelling continues everywhere.”

Despite Israel’s assurances, many Gazans fear that it aims to depopulate the north of the strip and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement.

"We are exhausted, completely worn out. Enough is enough."

In recent days, new evacuation orders have been issued by the Israeli military covering a wide area in the north of the enclave, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and parts of Gaza City.

All those remaining in the north - estimated at 400,000 people - have been told to head to the south.

“Displacement is extremely difficult, a tragedy."

Between 10.30am and 11.30am on 9 October last year, five Israeli airstrikes tore through the market, killing dozens of people.

They were the opening salvoes of a devastating Israeli campaign, conducted in three waves, that has left the camp an unrecognisable wasteland of rubble.

“This year is one of the worst I have experienced,” said 33-year-old Ahlam al-Tlouli, who comes from the Tal al-Zaatar area of the camp. The deadliest, on 31 October, [killed scores of people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/jabalia-camp-airstrike-gaza)
 and left large craters in the ground at a busy junction.

Israel said the camp was a command centre for Hamas’s northern brigade and that it had identified Hamas tunnel systems under the camp. “No house, person, tree or stone was spared.”

‘Jabaliya is like hell’
-----------------------

**The third offensive: October 2024 – ongoing**

The heavy damage inflicted on Jabaliya during the second offensive paled in comparison with the destruction levelled since 5 October, when Israeli forces returned in large numbers for a third time.

Over the course of the offensive – which targeted Jabaliya city as well as the camp – whole groupings of buildings have been demolished, replaced in some areas by bulldozed lanes to accommodate Israeli armour and tank berms. In late January, Israel withdrew from the camp.

‘All the houses were in ruins’
------------------------------

**The second offensive: May 2024**

Intermittent clashes continued throughout January despite Israeli claims that Hamas had been defeated in Jabaliya. This footage from April shows damage to buildings along two roads in the camp.

[Damaged buildings in Jabaliya refugee camp.](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops4.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops4.mp4)

On 11 May the IDF reported that Hamas had managed to reconstitute its military capabilities, and it issued a new round of evacuation orders to civilians. In footage posted online in recent weeks, bulldozers and backhoes can be seen pulling down structures.

[Backhoe used to pull down building in October 2024.](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops6.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops6.mp4)

Some neighbourhoods have almost entirely disappeared, including block 4, which included the camp’s main school complex.

“There are bodies on the roads and under the rubble,” said Mahmoud Basal, 39, a civil defence official. It has an awful momentum.”

Other observers detect a more deliberate agenda in Jabaliya and across northern Gaza: the slow enactment of a scorched earth policy known as the “generals’ plan”, aimed at driving out civilians from areas by declaring them “closed military zones” where anyone who stays is considered a combatant and all aid and other supplies are cut.

Regardless of the intention, whole-scale destruction of neighbourhoods has taken place across the north of Gaza, including in the camp.

[Satellite image of Jabaliya refugee camp from 12 Nov 2024](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/jabaliya_12-nov-2023_tue_final/giv-4559UcmYNSAvUq79)

A document circulated to Israeli combat soldiers in recent weeks, [revealed by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-11-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-gearing-up-to-remain-in-gaza-until-end-of-2025-at-least-this-is-what-it-looks-like/00000193-2230-d76d-a7db-637196a00000)
, talks of “exposing large areas” – a euphemism, the paper says, for destroying buildings and infrastructure in such a way that Hamas fighters cannot hide in them but no one can live in them either.

Nadia Hardman, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said HRW had identified a pattern in Jabaliya and across the north of Israeli forces clearing territory for buffer zones and security corridors.

“People can argue whether the campaign of bombing is reckless destruction or part of the hostilities, but taking control of an area and intentionally destroying it looks far more systematic,” Hardman said.

In a statement, the IDF said: “The IDF is currently operating in northern Gaza against terrorist targets due to Hamas’s efforts to restore its operational capabilities in the area … The IDF targets only military objectives. “Homes, streets, health and educational facilities – everything is gone.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image depicts an Israeli tank destroyed in the Gaza Strip. Multiple sources, including [africacheck.org](https://africacheck.org/fr/fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/guerre-israel-hamas-palestine-char-detruit-image-hors-contexe-2024-03-26), confirm this. The image was published in November 2023, and the reverse image search indicates it was used in articles about the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The web search results provide context about Israeli military operations in Jabalia, Gaza, in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the tank in the image was destroyed in an ambush by Hamas fighters, nor does it confirm the destruction of multiple vehicles or casualties among the crews.

Therefore, while the image's context is related to the claim, the claim's specific details about the ambush, the number of vehicles destroyed, and casualties are not verified by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Correct.

‘1ב’ (1Bet) is the senior TC’s (usually a 1st Sgt.) vehicle within 1st platoon. During my time in the army 25 years ago we did not paint those stripes on the mud guards (only the platoon markings), so I need to double check this theory with a fellow TC of mine who’s about ten years younger than me.

A regular IDF armored battalion used to have 3 tank companies, each equipped with 11 tanks (3 platoons with 3 vehicles each, plus the CO’s and the Exec’s tank), making a battalion 35 tanks strong (3 11 tanks strong companies, plus the battalion CO’s and his Exec’s tank).

About 10 years ago the number of tank companies in each armored battalion was reduced from 3 to 2, (replacing one of them with a support company), but the number of platoons in each company was increased from 3 to 4, making a standard company 10 tanks strong ( 4 2 tank platoons, plus the company CO’s and his Exec’s vehicle) thus bringing the total strength of a battalion to 33 tanks.

I’ve read an article a couple of years ago that there are plans to reduce the number of tank companies in every armored battalion even further (from 2 to 1) and replacing it with an infantry unit. The 2 sign to the left looks like it’s a perm feature on the tank as it looks like it’s part of the stowage box where as the 3looks like it’s on canvas ? Would TC 3 taken over tank 2 ?

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10231> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024."

## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the tank's origin or the woman's nationality. The claim also mentions the date, which is not verifiable with the available information.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

Decided to make this its own thread rather than clog up the May dispatch thread. Here is what Israeli tank markings mean (I didn't know and looked it up and figured I'd share)  
  
  
Battalion Markings  
Determining which tank belonged to which battalion in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) was indicated by the number of stripes present on the tank’s gun barrel. One stripe meant the tank belonged to the first battalion; two stripes the second battalion and so on. 
  
Company Markings  
Which company the tank belonged to was indicated by the direction a chevron (the V-shaped symbol on the decal sheet) was pointing. The chevron is pointing down indicates the tank belonged to the the first company; pointing forward the second company and pointing up indicates the third company. The number indicates the platoon; while the Hebrew letter indicates each individual tank within that platoon. 
  
Air Recognition Markings  
Israeli air recognition markings consisted of a wide white stripe outlined in black. (these are the numbers and letters at the front of the K&C tank - the black markings)

Sinwar had disappeared at the start of the war and, before the chance encounter in which he was killed, it was assumed he had spent much of the conflict hiding in tunnels beneath Gaza.

Several other top commanders of Hamas have been killed by Israel since the war began.

As a result of the conflict, the group's infrastructure and ability to operate openly in the Gaza Strip have been all but destroyed.

Its most [prominent leaders now include Khalil al-Hayya](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04p04lq27ko)

In November 2023, a [seven-day ceasefire between the two sides](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67589259)

Have Israel and Hamas fought before?
------------------------------------

Since its founding, Hamas has carried out bombings, rocket attacks and shootings, killing civilians and soldiers in Israel.

Israel has carried out operations against Hamas in Gaza and its cells in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, killing its fighters. In such operations, Israel has killed many Palestinian civilians.

The two sides have also fought several major conflicts - in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014.

The last major conflict between the two sides was in May 2021, which ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.

Every round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.

What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?

Hamas has been the sole ruler in the Gaza Strip since 2007

**Hamas is a Palestinian armed group and political movement in the Gaza Strip. On 7 October 2023 it attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.**

This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.

Hamas, which the US, UK, Israel and many other nations have designated as a terrorist organisation, continued to fire rockets into Israel.

In January 2025, Israel and Hamas agreed a deal to halt the war and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.

What is Hamas and what are its goals?
-------------------------------------

Hamas started as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1987. It wants a state based on Islam in its place and across the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.

It has, however, signalled its willingness to accept an interim Palestinian state in just the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, without renouncing its claim to all of historic Palestine.

Before the 7 October attacks, Hamas was estimated to have about 30,000 fighters, but Israel said in August that its forces had killed more than 17,000 of them. This can't be independently verified.

Hamas has been the sole ruler in the Gaza Strip since 2007, after winning Palestinian elections and violently ousting rivals.

*   [How Hamas built a force to attack Israel on 7 October](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67480680)
    

Who are Hamas's leaders?
------------------------

When Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, the group's main leader was Ismail Haniyeh. It has described the attack as a response to what it says are decades of Israeli oppression, the killings of Palestinians and years-long blockade of the Gaza Strip.

As Israel prepared to mark a year since the attack, al-Hayya justified it by saying it had put the plight of the Palestinians on the world's political agenda.

"It was necessary to raise an alarm in the world to tell them that here there is a people who have a cause and have demands that must be met," he told the BBC's Jeremy Bowen.

**ISTANBUL**

Iranian Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, was seen alive and well during celebrations Tuesday in Tehran of Iran's self-claimed victory over Israel, according to local media.

A video posted by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency showed Qaani among the crowd at the event.

“Commander Qaani attends today’s gathering of the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” the agency said on X.

State-funded Press TV also published the video, saying: “Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, was warmly received by a jubilant crowd in Tehran during victory celebrations over the Zionist (Israeli) regime.”

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Qaani was among the Iranian military leaders killed in Israeli strikes.

Israel launched airstrikes on several sites across Iran since June 13, including military and nuclear facilities, alleging that Tehran was on the verge of producing a nuclear bomb, a claim vehemently denied by Iran.

While Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, the US joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

After 12 days of aerial combat between the two regional arch-foes, US President Donald Trump announced overnight a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end their conflict. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel."

## Actions
```
web_search("Esmail Qaani Israel April 2025")
web_search("IRGC Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani whereabouts")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources discuss the whereabouts of Esmail Qaani, the IRGC Quds Force commander. According to articles from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/esmail-qaani/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/esmail-qaani/)), Qaani's appearances and whereabouts have been reported in 2023, 2024, and 2025, including reports of him being missing, under arrest, or attending events in Tehran and Beirut. One article from June 28, 2025, mentions a funeral in Tehran for military commanders killed in Israeli strikes <image:k>.

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) states that in June 2025, The New York Times reported, via Iranian state media, that Qaani was killed in Israeli airstrikes <image:k>. However, a social media video from June 24, 2025, showed Qaani in Tehran, contradicting the reports of his death. Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018)) reported on June 25, 2025, that Qaani was seen alive in Tehran, contradicting earlier reports of his death <image:k>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902): 
Content: The Jerusalem Post reports on June 25, 2025, that Esmail Qaani was seen at a rally in Tehran. <image:k> The New York Times reported that Qaani was killed during an Israeli strike in Iran, citing an Iranian source.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates conflicting reports about Esmail Qaani's status in April 2025. While the claim states he fled to Israel, the provided sources do not support this.
2.  Reports from June 2025 show Qaani alive in Tehran, contradicting reports of his death in Israeli strikes.
3.  The evidence does not provide any information about Qaani being in Israel. The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence does not support the claim that Esmail Qaani fled to Israel in April 2025. The search results show conflicting reports about his whereabouts, including reports of his death and appearances in Tehran. There is no information about him being in Israel.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While there were reports of Esmail Qaani's death in June 2025, and conflicting reports about his whereabouts, including appearances in Tehran, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel in April 2025.

الريادة: أفاد التلفزيون السوري ومصدر أمني باستهداف طائرات حربية إسرائيلية جنوب العاصمة دمشق، في ساعة متأخرة من مساء الثلاثاء.

ونقلت “رويترز” عن سكان في دمشق قولهم، إن دوي سلسلة من الانفجارات وصوت طائرات تحلق على ارتفاع منخفض، سُمع فوق العاصمة السورية.

وقالت وسائل إعلام إسرائيلية، إن 4 غارات إسرائيلية استهدفت مواقع عسكرية للنظام السابق في منطقة الكسوة بمحيط دمشق.

وكان [المرصد السوري](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/keyword-search?keyword=%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A&contentId=1779935)
 قد قال في وقت سابق من مساء الثلاثاء، إنه للمرة الثانية خلال ساعات، شنّ الطيران الإسرائيلي غارات على مواقع عند الحدود السورية- اللبنانية.

The Israeli military has conducted air raids targeting what it described as military bases and command centres in southern Syria and outside the capital, Damascus.

Israeli warplanes hit the town of Kiswa, approximately 20km (12 miles) south of Damascus, as well as the southern province of Deraa late on Tuesday, residents, security sources and local broadcaster Syria TV said.

The Israeli army said it struck “military targets in southern Syria, including command centres and multiple sites containing weapons”, without specifying exact locations.

Residents of Damascus reported hearing the sound of planes flying several low passes over the capital and a series of blasts.

“The Air Force is attacking strongly in southern Syria as part of the new policy we have defined of pacifying southern Syria – and the message is clear: we will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon,” Defence Minister Israel Katz’s spokesperson said in a statement.

“Any attempt by the Syrian regime forces and the country’s terrorist organisations to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria will be met with fire,” the statement added.

The bombardment came hours after Syria condemned Israel’s incursion into the country’s south and demanded it withdraw, according to the closing statement of a [national dialogue summit](/news/2025/2/26/key-takeaways-from-syrias-national-dialogue-conference)
. The summit, organised by Syria’s new government, aimed to outline the country’s political roadmap after the toppling of President [Bashar al-Assad](/news/2025/2/12/syrias-leader-russias-putin-make-first-contact-since-al-assads-fall)
 in December.

Israel moved forces into a United Nations-monitored demilitarised zone within Syria after al-Assad’s removal, a move that violated the 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the [“demilitarisation” of southern Syria](/news/2025/2/23/israel-wont-allow-syria-military-forces-south-of-damascus-netanyahu)
, saying Israel “will not allow the new Syrian army to move into territory south of Damascus”.

Jordan’s King Abdullah told Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa after a meeting in Amman on Wednesday he condemned Israeli attacks on Syria, a palace statement said.

Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the air strikes in the “strongest terms”, calling them “a blatant attack on Syrian sovereignty” and a continuation of Israel’s aggression against Arab nations.

The attacks complicate efforts by Syria’s new administration to reunify the country, said Qutaiba Idlbi, a resident senior fellow for Syria at the Atlantic Council.

He said the air raids coincided with the national dialogue summit on Syria’s political transition, which has already faced challenges, particularly in negotiations with the Druze community in the south and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast.

“The strikes on Damascus are only going to serve to delay such agreement, as the powers in northeast and southern Syria will feel more empowered to seek deals and perhaps military support from external actors to increase their leverage in negotiations with Damascus,” Idlbi told Al Jazeera.

Israel strikes targets in southern Syria after demanding demilitarisation

Military sites hit as Tel Aviv says it ‘will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon’

Israeli warplanes have carried out several airstrikes on military targets outside Damascus and in southern Syria, as Israeli officials warned the country’s army not to move south of the capital city.

Israeli jets struck military sites late on Tuesday in the town of Kiswah, south of Damascus, as well as in the southern province of Deraa, local [Syrian media](https://www.syria.tv/%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%BA%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9)
 reported.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the strikes in southern [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria)
 and warned that Israel “will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon”.

Katz added that “any attempt by the Syrian regime forces and the country’s terrorist organisations to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria will be met with fire”.

On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Shortly after a Syrian rebel offensive led by Islamist opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham [toppled the Assad regime on 8 December](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syrians-celebrate-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-after-five-decades-of-dynastic-rule)

Published On 17 Jul 202517 Jul 2025

Israel launched a series of air attacks on central Damascus, hitting a Ministry of Defence compound and areas near the presidential palace.

The attacks on Wednesday killed at least three people and wounded 34, according to Syria’s Ministry of Health, as reported by state media.

Israel also conducted attacks in southern Syria, where violent clashes between Druze groups, Bedouin tribes, and Syrian security forces have persisted for more than four days.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that more than 250 people have died in Suwayda province during these confrontations.

Israel, which occupies the Syrian Golan Heights, claims its operations are intended to protect the Druze minority – whom it views as a potential ally – and to target pro-government forces allegedly attacking it.

Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the Israeli attacks on Damascus and Suwayda as “part of a systematic Israeli policy to ignite tension and chaos and undermine security in Syria”, urging the international community to take “urgent action” against Israeli aggression.

The air attacks followed deadly clashes in Suwayda between Syrian government forces and local Druze fighters.

The conflict began with reciprocal kidnappings and attacks between Druze fighters and local Bedouin tribes. Many analysts suggest Israel prefers a weakened Syria over a potentially threatening stronger neighbour.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10236> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots."

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10236>

## Elaboration
I am sorry, but I am unable to verify the claim. The provided evidence does not contain any information about the image.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reports that on February 26, 2025, Israel conducted air raids targeting military bases and command centers in southern Syria and outside Damascus, specifically in Kiswa and Deraa. The article is available at [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus).

Wikipedia discusses the Israeli invasion of Syria, which began in December 2024, including airstrikes in Damascus and southern Syria through March 2025. The Guardian reported on February 25, 2025, on Israeli airstrikes on military targets outside Damascus and in southern Syria, available at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation). The Guardian article also includes images <image:11770>, <image:11772>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel conducted airstrikes in southern Syria and outside Damascus in February 2025, as the claim states. The provided sources mention military targets being hit in the areas specified in the claim. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the image itself. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts the events described in the claim.

Israel said it took military action in support of Syria’s Druze population which has been involved in deadly clashes with Syrian government forces in recent days. Syria agreed Wednesday to withdraw its troops from the southern city of Suwayda under a new ceasefire deal with Druze militia in the area.

Al Jazeera reports that on February 26, 2025, Israel conducted air raids targeting military bases and command centers in southern Syria and outside Damascus, specifically in Kiswa and Deraa. The article is available at [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus).

Wikipedia discusses the Israeli invasion of Syria, which began in December 2024, including airstrikes in Damascus and southern Syria through March 2025.

WHAT WAS CLAIMED

The New York Times published an opinion article titled “Why the Glorification of Luigi Mangione Is Inherently Anti-Israeli”.

OUR VERDICT

False. It did not publish an article with this headline.

AAP FACTCHECK - False claims are spreading online that the New York Times has called the "glorification" of the man charged with killing a US healthcare CEO "anti-Israeli".

But the headline is fake.

The paper confirmed [in a statement](https://www.nytco.com/press/tracking-misinformation-fabricated-opinion-headline/)
 that it "did not publish a headline or story titled, 'Why the Glorification of Luigi Mangione Is Inherently Anti-Israel'."

Mangione has been charged with killing United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson. Pape](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/directory/Robert-Pape)
 from the University of Chicago. 

The transcript shows Prof Pape exploring themes of political violence in America in relation to the murder of Mr Thompson.

Both the audio and transcript of the episode make no mention of Israel.

The fake headline has also been debunked by [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/12/13/new-york-times-headline-luigi-mangione-anti-israeli-fact-check/76965562007/)
 and [Lead Stories](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2024/12/fact-check-new-york-times-did-not-publish-opinion-column-with-headline-the-glorification-of-luigi-mangione-is-inherently-anti-israeli.html)
.

The Verdict

False – The claim is inaccurate.

NYT headline slamming 'anti-Israeli' glorification of Luigi Mangione is fake
============================================================================

James McManagan December 16, 2024

!AAP FactCheck Feature Image Update 13 v3 <image:11878>

This is not a real New York Times headline. (AP PHOTO)

A New York Times opinion article with the same publish date and subheading - "The shooting of Brian Thompson marks a new era of rage for this country" - does exist. 

The [legitimate article](https://archive.md/CekTW)
 is titled: "What the Glorification of Luigi Mangione Reveals About America".

The article is an edited transcript of an episode from New York Times podcast The Opinions featuring political scientist [Professor Robert A. He is yet to enter a plea.

The incident has sparked widespread reactions online, with Mangione receiving [praise from some](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/luigi-mangione-tiktoks-glorification-explanation-1.7410769)
 who view the attack as targeting a symbol of corporate greed.

The fabricated headline has been widely shared, with some social media users claiming it exemplifies an attempt to inject unrelated political narratives into Mangione's case.

"The op-Ed hits keep coming," one [Facebook user](https://archive.is/wip/R9AXh)
 said, sharing a screenshot of the fake headline. 

"Why do they make everything about Israel??" another [Facebook post](https://archive.is/wip/vjK2y)
 said.

!Luigi Mangione is taken into a courthouse. Our articles are thoroughly researched, carefully crafted and rigorously scrutinised to ensure the highest standard of accuracy and objectivity in every piece.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:11984>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:11985>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

A meme [posted](https://www.facebook.com/Gil.Nathan15/posts/122143061114318176)

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson [commented](https://x.com/chaimlevinson/status/1847939700037697686)
 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Shia group, allied to Iran, said it planned to send more guided missiles and explosive drones into Israel.

Israeli police at the scene targeted by a drone, in Caesarea, Israel, on Saturday. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway. Two patients died due to oxygen shortages, medics said.

Al-Awda hospital in the Jabalia neighbourhood of [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 City, already struggling to deal with the aftermath of a nearby strike overnight on Friday that killed 33 people, was also targeted by tank shelling that injured several staff members, the director said in a statement.

The killing of Sinwar in the southern city of Rafah after a year-long hunt for the architect of the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered the war in Gaza briefly raised hopes that an elusive ceasefire and hostage release deal could be reached.

Both Israel and Hamas, however, have so far stuck to their incompatible positions. The Lebanese militia Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for the attack, but said it fired several barrages of rockets at northern and central Israel, which killed a 50-year-old man in Acre.

The rocket attacks came after Hezbollah said on Friday it had entered a new phase of the full-scale war that began with Israel’s ground invasion of southern [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 earlier this month."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, multiple sources explicitly state that there were no casualties. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is false.

CLAIM: An image shows a social media post by actor Mel Gibson about “the end” of Israel and the country’s desire to “destroy everything” in its way.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor’s publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the “Braveheart” star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn’t quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The “post” features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

But Alan Nierob, Gibson’s publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor “did not make the post.” Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson “doesn’t have any public social media accounts.”

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel <image:12053>

Alberto E. 7.

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel&#39;s time was coming to an end and that&#39;s why they&#39;re destroying everything in the way. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

The post apparently referenced the fact that Israel had [continued to conduct airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-b084e9c453cc99f7bec6f66d7b5913d9)
 in Gaza while at the same time preparing its military for a ground assault. Further, the first few words of the caption appeared to have been a poor translation to English by the person who created the post.

While it's true that Gibson had [expressed](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
 some anti-Semitic views in the past, the post in question was fake.

!Mel Gibson post suggesting ‘the end’ of Israel is fake <image:12068>

[Featureflash Photo Agency/ShutterStock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/cannes-france-may-21-2016-actor-475645804) (Licensed)

A screenshot of a post purportedly made by Hollywood actor Mel Gibson claims that “the end” of Israel is coming. Text attributed to Gibson [above](https://www.twitter.com/hivekvari/status/1716241695854264324/)
 the image states: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

https://twitter.com/Sarahrezaei1/status/1715451771928113166

Shared originally on Facebook and later to Instagram by a meme account with numerous racist and anti-Israel posts, the screenshot was met with applause from some users.

Advertisement

“He’s always known what’s up,” one Instagram user wrote of Gibson.

“The world is waking up,” another added.

Yet others pushed back on the post by correctly characterizing it as fake, causing some to point to Gibson’s history with antisemitism as evidence of its legitimacy.

“Have u ever seen his movie, the passion of the christ?. Ritchie Torres over Israel. Are you even old enough to remember that?”

Advertisement

In 2006, Gibson [stated](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
 that “Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world” while being arrested for driving while intoxicated.

Despite his past remarks, the screenshot attributed to Gibson is fake."

Study debunks nuclear test misinformation following 2024 Iran earthquake
========================================================================

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

The **9/11 Living Memorial Plaza** ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language")
: האנדרטה לזכר קרבנות אסון מגדלי התאומים) consists of an Israeli [cenotaph](/wiki/Cenotaph "Cenotaph")
 surrounded by a larger complex near [Ramot, Jerusalem](/wiki/Ramot,_East_Jerusalem "Ramot, East Jerusalem")
. It was built on 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land, having been completed in 2009, and had been designed by Israeli artist [Eliezer Weishoff](/wiki/Eliezer_Weishoff "Eliezer Weishoff")
 to honour the victims of the [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks")
, which were carried out by [al-Qaeda](/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda")
 against the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")

The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza Complex

The cenotaph measures 30 feet and is made of granite, bronze, and aluminum. It takes the form of an American flag, waving and transforming into a flame at the tip. A piece of melted metal from the ruins of the [Twin Towers](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973-2001) "World Trade Center (1973-2001)")
 forms part of the base on which the monument rests. A glass pane over the metal facilitates viewing. The names of the victims, including five Israeli citizens,[\[1\]](#cite_note-JPost-1)
 are embedded on the metal plate and placed on the circular wall. The monument is strategically located within view of Jerusalem's main cemetery, [Har HaMenuchot](/wiki/Har_HaMenuchot "Har HaMenuchot")
.[\[2\]](#cite_note-kkl-2)

The folded part of the flag is reminiscent of the collapse of the towers in a cloud of dust. The flag morphs into a six-meter-high memorial flame representative of a torch.[\[2\]](#cite_note-kkl-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 It is the first and only monument outside of the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
 which lists the names of the nearly 3,000 victims of the 9/11 attacks.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)

The cenotaph was designed by award-winning artist [Eliezer Weishoff](/wiki/Eliezer_Weishoff "Eliezer Weishoff")
. It was commissioned by the [Jewish National Fund](/wiki/Jewish_National_Fund "Jewish National Fund")
 (JNF/KKL) at a cost of ₪ 10 million ($2 million).[\[5\]](#cite_note-Haaretz-5)
 The inauguration ceremony was held on 12 November 2009 with representation from the US Ambassador to Israel, [James B. Cunningham](/wiki/James_B._Cunningham "James B. Cunningham")
, members of the Israeli Cabinet and legislature, the families of victims and others.[\[1\]](#cite_note-JPost-1)

The 2013 memorial for the 9/11 attacks was commemorated at Living Memorial Plaza. Families of victims and diplomats attended the event. [U.S. Ambassador to Israel](/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Israel "United States Ambassador to Israel")
 [Daniel B. Shapiro](/wiki/Daniel_B._Shapiro "Daniel B. Shapiro")
 commented during the ceremony: "Here, at this painfully beautiful memorial site, we are a reminder to everyone that we, Americans and Israelis, stand together in a spirit of solidarity and commitment to the future."[\[1\]](#cite_note-JPost-1)

In Israeli society

[![9/11 memorial in Israel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.israelpharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9-11-memorial.jpg)
We wanted to share something with you, something that is not widely known to many Americans (and not all Israeli’s either).  
In Israel we have a dedicated memorial to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Not only does it stand out poignantly on a hill in the middle of Israel, near Jerusalem, but the base is made out of 9/11 twin tower wreckage. It cost more than $2 million to make and was orchestrated by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).  
Unfortunately Israel knows how to build memorials and monuments. In this small country with so much turbulence, we know only too well the suffering of those who die needlessly in these terrorist attacks. This memorial is known simply as the “9/11 Memorial Plaza”.  
Here are some interesting facts about the 9/11 Memorial Plaza.

*   The memorial Plaza was completed in 2009 for $2 million, by the JNF.
*   It sits on 5 acres of hillside, 20 miles from the center of Jerusalem, not a small monument at all. It overlooks Jerusalem’s largest cemetery, Har HaMenuchot.
*   The memorial monument is in the shape of a 30-foot, bronze American flag that has been built in the shape of a flame to commemorate the flames of the Twin Towers.
*   The base is made out of melted twin tower wreckage.
*   Surrounding the main monument are plaques listing the names of all the people who died as a result of the attacks. Even though the memorial stands in Israel and only 5 Israel citizens died as a result of the attacks the memorial lists ALL the victims who perished. It is the only memorial outside the US which lists ALL of those who died in the attacks.

Times are turbulent and the entire Middle East is going through vast changes. Some say the relationship between the US and Israel is in trouble…… whatever happens, there will always be a special relationship between the US (in particular New York) and Israel.  
A powerful memorial… so the world never forgets.

For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Barcelona’s move came a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel’s military operations in Gaza amid the war sparked by the Hamas terror group’s devastating attack on October 7, 2023.

Barcelona’s city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing alleged violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, called for an end to all official relations with Israel “until respect for international law” and the “basic rights of the Palestinian people” are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with the liberal coastal city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organizer Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

“The suffering and death in Gaza over the past year and a half, and recent attacks by the Israeli government, make any relationship unviable,” Barcelona’s Mayor Jaume Collboni said during the council session.

It was not the first time Barcelona had moved to suspend ties with Israel.

In 2023, then-mayor Ada Colau took similar steps, which were later reversed when Collboni won local elections.

While the move has little practical impact, the decision by Spain’s second-largest city — a top tourist destination and home to one of the world’s best-known football clubs — adds to a growing list of critics of Israel amid the devastating war in Gaza.

Gaza, other Palestinian cities to become Barcelona's symbolic 11th district

The concept builds on a 1995 precedent when Barcelona symbolically named Sarajevo its 11th district to show solidarity and support for the city's recovery after the Srebrenica genocide.

The initiative, starting with an initial budget of €1 million ($1.16 million), is scheduled to begin at the end of the year and aims for a medium- and long-term horizon, including reconstruction efforts.

This week, Collboni also pledged to double UNRWA funding for food and medicine from €200,000 ($231,824) to €400,000 ($463,725), and said he would “stabilise and scale up” technical cooperation with cities like Gaza, Ramallah and Bethlehem through municipal staff, council structures and city resources.

Over the weekend, Collboni said he had planned to travel to Israel and Palestine, but Israeli authorities denied him entry.

“We were going to start a mission of cooperation and peace, paying attention to the mayors of Bethlehem and Ramallah. / Reuters

August 27, 2025

Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni announced on Tuesday that Gaza and other Palestinian cities will symbolically become Barcelona’s 11th district to enhance cooperation and solidarity.

Collboni unveiled the plan during a visit to Jordan, saying the new district would be a technical and budgetary entity within Barcelona’s municipal structure. It will complement the city’s 10 existing districts and coordinate all cooperation projects with Palestinian cities and UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.

“This is no longer a one-off cooperation with visits, but a permanent structure, designed to utilise the talent of municipal technicians,” he said, adding that a similar structure could be created “in Palestinian territory or, if necessary, in Jordan”.

The concept follows a precedent set in 1995 when Barcelona symbolically designated Sarajevo as its 11th district to support its recovery after the Srebrenica genocide.

[! The objective was to know first-hand the reality of Palestinian cities and explore ways of aid from Barcelona at these critical moments,” he wrote on social media.

ספרד גינתה את החלטת ברצלונה: "ניתוק הקשר עם ישראל? פגיעה בערכי העיר"
====================================================================

שר החוץ של ספרד יצא נגד ההחלטה החד-צדדית של ראש העיר אדה קולאו. בוועידה שהתקיימה בעיר טען: "היא לא תועיל בבניית דיאלוג בין ישראל לפלסטינים". וגם: התמיכה המפתיעה של מועדון הכדורגל המפואר

ממשלת ספרד גינתה אתמול (שישי) את החלטת מועצת העיר ברצלונה [לנתק "באופן זמני"](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/b1jfvzzas)
 את הקשר עם ישראל. "ההחלטה החד-צדדית הזו פוגעת בערכי העיר שמאמינה בפתיחות", הצהירה הממשלה.

שר החוץ של ספרד, חוסה מנואל אלברס, אמר בוועידה כלכלית בברצלונה כי הוא אינו מאמין שניתוק הקשר ישיג את מטרותיו ובוודאי שלא יועיל בבניית דיאלוג בין ישראל לפלסטינים. "אני מאמין כי הייעוד של ברצלונה הוא להיות עיר חופשית, כמו הייעוד של ספרד. ההחלטה הזו, שנלקחה על ידי מועצת העיר פוגעת בערך זה", טען.

בשבוע שעבר, וכשלצידה נציגים פרו-פלסטינים, כינסה ראש עיריית ברצלונה, אדה קולאו, מסיבת עיתונאים שבמהלכה הגיעה ההכרזה המוחצת. לפי ההחלטה, בירת קטלוניה תנתק את הקשרים עם מדינת ישראל בשל מדיניות האפרטהייד, לדבריה, כלפי הפלסטינים. מסיבת העיתונאים הסתיימה במחיאות כפיים מצד תומכי היוזמה לאחר שאחת מהנואמות שהוזמנה הריעה "תחי פלסטין החופשית".

בנוסף, שלחה קולאו מכתב רשמי לראש הממשלה בנימין נתניהו, המסביר את הצעד החד צדדי מצד ברצלונה. "החלטתי לנתק באופן זמני את היחסים עם מדינת ישראל ומוסדותיה הרשמיים, כולל ברית ערים תאומות עם עיריית תל אביב, עד אשר הרשויות בישראל יפסיקו את האלימות הסיסטמטית והפרת זכויות האדם של העם הפלסטיני", כתבה. היא ציינה כי הקפאת היחסים היא זמנית, ולא מופנית נגד האזרחים.

הפלסטינים בירכו על ההכרזה וטענו כי היא מייצגת את חשיבות הלחץ על ממשלת ישראל "הפשיסטית והנקמנית", כלשונם. בפדרציה היהודית בספרד גינו את ההחלטה וכינו אותה "אנטישמיות מתוחכמת. "ההכרזה של ראש עיריית ברצלונה לא נובעת מהגנה על זכויות האדם או השלום", טענו.

מועדון הפאר נגד ראש העיר

קבוצת הכדורגל ברצלונה התייחסה בחמישי להחלטה מעוררת המחלוקת, ונשיא מועדון הפאר ג'ואן לפורטה החליט להעביר מסר של תמיכה בישראל. לפורטה הזמין את נציגי שגרירות ישראל בספרד למשחק הכדורגל נגד מנצ'סטר יונייטד במסגרת הליגה האירופית שנערך שלשום ואף העניק להם חולצות של קבוצת הכדורגל.

בטקס שנערך לפני המשחק, לפורטה הדגיש את המחויבות ארוכת השנים של המועדון ליחסים המצוינים עם מדינת ישראל ועם ישראל. ב-2013 הגיע המועדון לביקור בארץ, במסגרתו נפגשו עם ראש הממשלה דאז וכיום בנימין נתניהו, וכן עם הנשיא לשעבר שמעון פרס. הביקור אז ננעל באימון חגיגי עם ילדים יהודים וערבים באצטדיון בלומפילד ביפו.

המחווה של קבוצת הכדורגל ברצלונה מצטרפת לגל של מחאה בעיר ברצלונה, בקטלוניה ובספרד כולה כנגד ההחלטה של ראש העיר. ב-ynet וב"ידיעות אחרונות" [נחשפה היוזמה](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ryrhr7psi)
 לניתוק ברית ערים תאומות עם תל אביב, שעלתה לראשונה לפני מספר חודשים על ידי ארגוני שמאל קיצוני וארגונים פרו-פלסטיניים בברצלונה, שזכו לתמיכת קולאו ומפלגתה.

היוזמה הייתה אמורה לעבור להצבעה דמוקרטית במועצת העיר, אך קולאו החליטה לקחת את הדין לידיה. בלי הצבעה, בלי זכות דיבור, מבלי לתת מקום לחוות דעת מטעם נציגי מפלגות המועצה. לפי מקורבים, גל הביקורות נגד היוזמה והחשש שההצבעה תסתיים ברוב קולות למען שימור ברית הערים התאומות עם תל אביב, הביאו את ראש העיר באופן חד צדדי על ניתוק היחסים לא רק עם תל אביב אלא גם עם מוסדות מדינת ישראל.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states the image was taken in September 2024 during the Gaza war. However, the reverse image search and web search results indicate the image was taken on February 16, 2023. The Gaza war started on October 7, 2023. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported that FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, invited Israeli embassy representatives to a soccer match on February 16, 2023, and included a photo of them holding an Israeli flag (<image:1>). The Times of Israel reported that Barcelona's city council voted to cut ties with the Israeli government, citing the ongoing Gaza war, which started on October 7, 2023 (<image:12138>, <image:12137>, <image:12139>). TRT Global reported on August 27, 2025, about Barcelona's Mayor's plan to enhance cooperation with Gaza and other Palestinian cities (<image:12140>).

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:10247>) shows FC Barcelona President Joan Laporta with representatives from the Israeli embassy. According to an article from Ynet, published on February 17, 2023, Laporta showed support for Israel by inviting the representatives to a football match.

The Jerusalem Post published an article on January 15, 2025, stating that the image was taken on February 16, 2023, when Israeli diplomats presented the FC Barcelona president with an Israeli flag.

## Elaboration
The claim states the image was taken in September 2024 during the Gaza war. However, the reverse image search and web search results indicate the image was taken on February 16, 2023. The Gaza war started on October 7, 2023. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image was taken on February 16, 2023, before the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023. The claim is therefore inaccurate regarding the date. `false`

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

**Altered screenshot**

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

).

###### **Israel’s Channel 12 has said it did not broadcast a purported poll circulating on social media in August 2024 about the treatment of prisoners by the Israeli army as the Gaza war raged. 47% Yes 43% No,” read the caption alongside the altered image posted on [Facebook](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)
 on August 11.

The image appeared to show a news presenter from Israel’s Channel 12 standing next to a poll graphic with a Hebrew-language question that translates as: “Do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a “terrorist”?”

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. 

The screenshots show the image originally shared by Erakat said 47% of respondents answered "yes" to a poll asking "do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian?" Various X users later claimed the image was a doctored version of a 2022 Channel 12 poll, which asked respondents about the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters."

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?” 

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that “they should stand criminal trial”; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn’t know.  

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B’tselem in their report “[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.” High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. There is almost nothing they can do to Palestinians that the Jewish Israeli public would consider criminal, and hardly any Israelis would consider them “human animals” for thinking like that. 

_Correction: The story originally incorrectly said that “28% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‘they should stand criminal trial.'” The correct percentage is 21%. The story has been updated._

Well, here it is: “**The Radicalization of Israel’s Military – How the response to alleged abuse of Palestinian detainees reveals a wider ideological war within the I.D.F**_.”_

This is an interview with Yehuda Shaul, co-founder of Breaking the Silence and  Ofek: The Israeli Center for Public Affairs. **The Israel lobby, especially the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which owns most members of Congress, is too powerful."

Claim: "<image:10249> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'"

## Actions
```
web_search("Channel 12 Israel public opinion poll rape prisoner")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image in the claim is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12 (<image:10249>). The original poll, broadcast on May 27, 2022, asked about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism. The altered image, which falsely presented a question about soldiers and rape, was shared on Facebook and X. Channel 12 denied broadcasting the poll and debunked the false posts.

The original poll and the doctored image are discussed in articles from cedmohub.eu ([https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/](https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/)) and cbsaustin.com ([https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza)). Mondoweiss ([https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/)) discusses a separate poll about the prosecution of soldiers. <image:12236>, <image:12226>, <image:12235>, <image:12240>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, broadcast on May 27, 2022, did not ask the question about soldiers and rape. Channel 12 denied broadcasting the poll and debunked the false posts.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll did not contain the question about soldiers and rape. Channel 12 has debunked the false posts. `false`

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

| Fear the Mossad of the Israelis. The guy run for his life. If he didn't disguise like this, he is a walking corpse. Notwithstanding his disguise, his days are numbered. I have never seen a country that is war-thirsty like the Israelites currently. They are giving it to the Arabs back to back in a hot languages they truly understand.

There's nothing like ghosting, you either have information or you do not ...  <br>  <br>I think Nigeria should learn from Iran and have a redundant command system, Incase all the Generals are deceived into a bunker.

There has been no news regarding the whereabouts of Major General Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in recent days.

Qaani was notably absent from a ceremony where IRGC Air Force Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh received a medal for striking Israel last week. Israel’s Channel 12 also reported that the possibility of Qaani being injured in a bomb explosion is under investigation.

**Iranian Silence and Denials**

The Iranian government has remained silent regarding Esmail Qaani's disappearance. Mohammad Mehdi Hemmat, the son of a martyr from the Iran-Iraq war, posted on X , “Our dear Haji Esmail Qaani is in perfect health. Don’t fall for the enemy’s media games, which only show their weakness.” 

Media outlets close to the IRGC also shared a social media post from Qaani’s nephew, asserting that he is alive.  

Old reports from Mehr News Agency and IRIB, titled “Denial of Esmail Qaani’s Martyrdom,” were republished on social media on October 5 and 6, though these reports were outdated.

Additionally, Hamshahri Online stated that the Parliament News Agency, citing a member of the Parliament’s Security Commission, confirmed Qaani’s well-being. However, the Parliament News Agency later denied interviewing Abbas Golrou, the member in question.

**Who is Esmail Qaani, The Missing Commander?**  

Esmail Qaani was appointed as the commander of the Quds Force following the assassination of his predecessor, Qasem Soleimani. He was then appointed deputy commander of the Quds Force.

Despite his long tenure in Quds Force, Esmail Qaani struggled to match Qasem Soleimani’s influence. The extensive propaganda, including legendary stories, books, films, and countless public events left little room for Qaani to build his mark.

One of Qaani’s rare public comments came in December 2022 regarding women without hijabs. His disappearance, however, has sparked jokes and speculation on social media.

The last confirmed sighting of Qaani was on September 29 at Hezbollah’s office in Tehran.

**Last Seen in Beirut**

According to The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post, Qaani was last seen in Lebanon’s southern suburbs of Beirut, an area targeted by Israeli airstrikes last week. 

On October 6, Reuters, citing two senior Iranian security officials, reported that Qaani had gone missing following the Israeli strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs on October 4."

The commander of [Iran's Quds Force](https://www.newarab.com/news/after-irans-rockets-hit-israel-commits-massacres-gaza)
 Esmail Qaani is in "good health", the unit's deputy commander said Monday, following claims he had possibly been assassinated by Israel

Iraj Masjedi said Qaani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) expeditionary force was safe and no further statement on the issue is needed.

It follows comments made by two senior Iranian security officials on Sunday that Qaani had not been heard from since a huge wave of Israeli airstrikes on Beirut late last week, which is believed to have killed senior Hezbollah and Iranian commanders.

Qaani traveled to Lebanon after an Israeli air strike killed [Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-military-says-hezbollah-chief-nasrallah-eliminated)
 and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut.

Contact with Nasrallah's replacement Hashem Safieddine has also been reportedly lost, with fears in the group that he could have been targeted and killed also in the strikes, which have resulted in hundreds of civilians killed.

On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [fired some 200 missiles](https://www.newarab.com/news/irans-khamenei-says-iran-missile-attack-israel-legitimate)
 at Israel in retaliation for the killings of the leaders. 

It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel.

Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas force after US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of [Qassem Soleimani](https://www.newarab.com/video/twin-blast-kills-dozens-irans-qassem-soleimani-memorial)
 in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.

Part of Qaani's task in that post has been to manage Tehran's paramilitary allies across the Middle East, as well as in other regions around the world, who have been key pillars of support for Iran's axis allies in the region, including Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.

These groups have been heavily targeted by Israeli forces in recent months, including the Hashd Al-Shaabi in Iraq, the [Houthis of Yemen](https://www.newarab.com/news/official-denies-us-offered-recognise-houthi-sanaa-government)
, and Iranian-led Shia militias in Syria.

When Qaani took over the force after deputising Soleimani for over two decades, he vowed to boot US forces out of the Middle East in revenge for Soleimani's killing.

"We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region," state radio quoted Qaani as saying ahead of Soleimani's funeral in Tehran.

Qaani, 67, was born in Mashhad, a conservative Shia Muslim religious city in northeastern Iran. He fought for the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and has experience in overseas operations beyond Iran's eastern borders, including Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He does not speak Arabic, unlike Soleimani who spoke fluently with Iraqi militias and Hezbollah commanders.

He has adopted less of a public persona than Soleimani and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Unlike Soleimani, who over the years was widely photographed on battlefields in Iraq and Syria alongside the militias Tehran has armed and trained, Qaani has preferred to keep a lower profile and conduct most of his meetings and visits to neighbouring countries in private. 

He has adopted a low public profile compared to Soleimani - who was seen as a daring, down-to-earth, and charismatic figure - and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

About the Authors

[Jaber Rajabi](/experts/jaber-rajabi)

Jaber Rajabi is a former official in more than one Iran-backed Iraqi militia. In 2016, Rajabi defected from the so-called Axis of Resistance and became a vocal opponent of the Islamic Republic’s policies in the region as well as its domestic policies.

Brief Analysis

After the killing of Qods Force commander Qasem Soleimani, Esmail Qaani may have inherited a role for which he was not prepared, bringing instead a new style of leadership to the IRGC.

Upon the death of Soleimani, Esmail Qaani took over this role as spelled out in Soleimani’s own will. Further signs of Qaani’s limited control include [Asaib Ahl al-Haq](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/profile-asaib-ahl-al-haq-0)
 and the Badr Organization’s private attacks on him, and Muqtada al-Sadr’s refusal to allow Qaani to enter his house multiple times.

This new reality has ultimately had an impact on how Tehran manages its proxy relationships writ large. However, if he does manage to retain his position, Qaani will likely aim to carry out a wide-ranging structural change in the Qods Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, further bringing the force out of the age of Soleimani and into a different kind of role in the region to match Qaani’s own leadership style and limitations.

[Sign up for email alerts](http://info.washingtoninstitute.org/acton/form/19961/0002:d-0001/0/-/-/-/-/index.htm) Yet understanding Qaani’s position under Soleimani helps explain some of his subsequent decisionmaking as Qods Force leader, along with some of the challenges he currently faces in that role.

During Soleimani's tenure as Qods Force commander, Qaani's role was mostly focused on managing the force's internal affairs. Soleimani was either traveling or in meetings and gatherings with various individuals, leaving the administrative and internal affairs to Qaani.

Although the Qods Force—part of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)—comprises different components and ranks known as Units 400, 340, 12,000, and 700, among others, each has tasks in different geographical areas and dimensions. Qaani was also present in this council as the deputy commander of the Qods Force.

However, Qasem Soleimani acted like a spiritual father in networks akin to a mafia head; many of these networks do not fall under the ranks of the Qods Force. Therefore, when Qaani took over, many of these groups had no prior connection with him and knew little about him. Qaani likewise did not have significant field knowledge of these groups given his experience focusing primarily on internal affairs.

The situation does not appear to have improved significantly since Qaani only meets proxy leaderships within a certain framework and in a very formal atmosphere, which has caused the relations between him and the groups affiliated with Iran in the region to cool down. Instead, proxy leaderships often now prefer to interact with those people who were close to Soleimani—especially the Unit 400 whose members compete with Qaani within the organization.

Qasem Soleimani was afflicted with an illusion of power and believed that no one would attempt to kill him because the cost would be too high."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10252>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him <image:1>. The image <image:10252>

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

MADRID – In recent days, various Western and regional media outlets have raised questions regarding the whereabouts of Ismail Qaani, the head of the Iranian Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force. 

Recently, the news agency Reuters, known for its history of false reporting concerning Iran, published an article claiming that after the Israeli attacks in Beirut, which resulted in the deaths of Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian General Abbas Nilforoushan, “contact with Ismail Qaani has been lost.”

Meanwhile, the Qatari-funded outlet Middle East Eye provided a more elaborate version in an article labeled as an "exclusive," published on October 10 on its website. Iran International, a Persian-language outlet linked to the Zionist regime and covertly directed by Manouchehr Amir, a former director of Radio Israel, cited an "informed source" claiming that Commander Qaani's family also had no news regarding his whereabouts or what he was doing.

Additionally, Sky News published a supposed detailed report stating that Qaani had suffered a heart attack during an interrogation and was receiving treatment. According to this version, "close sources" to Sky News were unaware of the commander’s current condition following the incident.

Finally, the Saudi channel Al Arabiya questioned, “Why is there no news about Commander Qaani? Where is Commander Qaani?”

From the Islamic Republic, various explanations have been provided regarding the state of the Quds Force commander. On October 7, a high-ranking official from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed that General Qaani was in good health. Moreover, the same official indicated that Qaani had issued a message to commemorate the anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:10252>)
geolocate(<image:10252>)
web_search("Esmail Qaani hijab disguise")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10252>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him <image:1>. The image <image:10252>

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

The Jerusalem Post published an article about Esmail Qaani, the head of the IRGC's Quds Force, and includes a picture of him, mentioning his wariness of assassination ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988)). The Washington Institute also published an article discussing Qaani's leadership struggles, including a picture of him <image:1>

Content: "A close associate of Soleimani and a prominent figure in the Quds Force, Qaani has played a key role in strengthening the Resistance Axis in the region, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.

_Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, attends the opening ceremony of Iran’s 12th parliament in Tehran, Iran, May 27, 2024. The IRGC has yet to release a statement clarifying his status, and no new photos or videos of him have been published.

_A report suggesting Esmail Qaani’s presence at a Hezbollah meeting targeted by an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut. Qaani’s possible death:**

Iran International claimed that Esmail Qaani might have been killed by the Israeli military, though this was denied by media outlets close to the IRGC.

A speculative report on Qaani’s possible death in an Israeli military operation by Iran International. Hezbollah’s lack of information:**

_Claims that Hezbollah has no knowledge of Esmail Qaani’s current statuation. Moreover, the Quds Force’s deputy commander recently stated at a ceremony that Qaani was in good health and actively carrying out his duties.

Ultimately, all these rumors and false scenarios were fully debunked when Esmail Qaani attended the funeral of General Niloofar in person today. His participation in the funeral made it clear that the opposition media’s fabrications were baseless and that the truth had been revealed.

**WANA (Oct 15) –** Over the past two weeks, anti-Islamic Republic media outlets and opposition-linked networks, such as Iran International, have attempted to mislead public opinion in Iran, the Resistance Axis, and even globally through various fabrications about Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force. It appears that these efforts are part of Israel’s psychological operations against the Resistance Axis, involving the dissemination of false information.

Esmail Qaani was appointed as the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in 2019 after the assassination of Qassem Soleimani. One official said Qaani was in southern Beirut during the Israeli attack but was not meeting with Hashem Safieddine.

_Reuters claims that communication with Qaani was lost following Israeli strikes in Lebanon. A source informed Iran International that his family members did not know of his whereabouts.

Iranian Commander Esmail Qaani Refutes Death Rumors with Public Appearance
==========================================================================

! <image:12387>

Tehran, MINA – Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, made a public appearance in Tehran on Monday, refuting rumors that he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike.

Footage released by Iran’s _Tasnim News Agency_ shows Qaani attending a public rally celebrating what officials described as “Iran’s victory over the Zionist regime.” The event drew a large crowd in the capital.

“General Qaani participated in today’s gathering with the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” Tasnim said in a post on X.

Iran’s English-language broadcaster, Press TV, also aired the footage, reporting that Qaani was greeted with applause and chants by an enthusiastic crowd.

His appearance comes after The New York Times reported that Qaani may have been among the senior Iranian officials killed in an Israeli operation targeting Iranian military infrastructure in the region.

While Iranian authorities have not formally responded to the international media reports, Qaani’s public appearance appears intended to dispel the speculation surrounding his status. <image:12435>

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10252> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:10252>)
geolocate(<image:10252>)
web_search("Esmail Qaani hijab disguise")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10252>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him <image:1>. The image <image:10252>

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
web_search("Esmail Qaani image analysis")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post published an article about Esmail Qaani, the head of the IRGC's Quds Force, and includes a picture of him, mentioning his wariness of assassination ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988)). The Washington Institute also published an article discussing Qaani's leadership struggles, including a picture of him <image:1>

## Elaboration
The additional search results provide more context about Esmail Qaani. The Jerusalem Post article mentions his wariness of assassination, which aligns with the claim's suggestion of disguise due to fear. However, the articles do not confirm that the image <image:10252>

Vote on a Draft Resolution on the War in Gaza\*
===============================================

Tomorrow morning (20 November), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
, which was put forward by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. The remaining 14 members voted in favour.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

US vetoes Security Council resolution demanding permanent ceasefire in Gaza
===========================================================================

**By** **Vibhu Mishra**

4 June 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

A draft resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza failed to pass in the UN Security Council on Wednesday after the United States cast its veto – blocking the initiative backed by all ten elected members of the Council.

The text, co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia – collectively known as the E-10 – received 14 votes in favour, with the US casting the lone vote against.

As one of the council’s five permanent members, the US holds veto power – a negative vote that automatically blocks any resolution from going forward.

Had it been adopted, the draft would have demanded “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” to be respected by all parties.

Release all hostages
--------------------

The text reaffirmed the Council’s earlier call for the “**immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups**.”

The draft also expressed grave concern over the “**catastrophic humanitarian situation**” in Gaza – following months of almost total Israeli aid blockade – including the risk of famine, highlighted by recent assessments by international food security experts.

It reaffirmed the obligation of all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.

Resume flow of aid
------------------

In addition to a ceasefire, the draft resolution demanded the “**immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions**” on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza, calling for safe and unhindered access for UN and humanitarian partners across the enclave.

It also urged the restoration of essential services, in accordance with humanitarian principles and prior [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 resolutions.

The text voiced support for ongoing mediation efforts led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States to revive the phased ceasefire framework outlined in resolution 2735 (2024), which envisions a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of all remains, full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, and the start of a long-term reconstruction plan.

Draft resolution unacceptable: United States
--------------------------------------------

Speaking ahead of the vote, acting US Representative Dorothy Shea described the draft resolution as “unacceptable”.  

“US opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise – it is unacceptable for what it does say, it is unacceptable for what it does not say, and it is unacceptable for the manner in which it has been advanced,” she said.

“The United States has been clear,” she continued, “we would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza.”

She added that Hamas has rejected numerous ceasefire proposals, including one over the weekend that would have provided a pathway to end the conflict and release the remaining hostages.

“We cannot allow the Security Council to award Hamas’ intransigence,” Ms. As Secretary \[Marco\] Rubio has said: ‘If an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire’.” 

‘The world is watching’
-----------------------

The failure of the resolution comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with UN agencies warning of the total collapse of health services, growing displacement, and a rising death toll around the new privatized US-Israel led aid distribution system which bypasses established agencies.

“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said UN relief chief Tom Fletcher earlier on Wednesday.

 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")

 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)

 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)

At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding.
    
    Nick Schifrin is in New York now and joins us with more.
    
    So, Nick, what's in this proposal and could it be accepted by both sides?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    Well, Geoff, as you said, Israel has accepted this proposal, which would be a 60-day cease-fire of the war in Gaza. We call on President Trump to pressure Netanyahu and Hamas.
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    There are American and Israeli officials, Geoff, who do believe and tell me that if President Trump were to publicly pressure Netanyahu to end the war, Netanyahu would agree.
    
    But, for now, until Hamas agrees to this draft we have been talking about or Israel changes its policy and agrees to end the war in full, the war goes on.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Nick Schifrin in New York tonight.
    
    Nick, thank you for that reporting.

Nick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding. Hamas would also return the bodies of 18 dead Israeli hostages.
    
    In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian detainees, including more than 100 serving life sentences. But so long as the war continues, Israel's military vows to take over 75 percent of Gaza, pushing Gazans into small areas in the south, what Israel, Geoff, calls sterile zones.

    And how is Israel responding to the cease-fire proposal?

    As we have discussed multiple times, Geoff, Israeli society is split. You see there some scuffled with police last night after they broke into the ruling Likud headquarters.

    Today, Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. But this would not, as you said, end the war or require Israel to withdraw from Gaza."

The US has blocked a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council - the fourth time it has used its veto power during the conflict to shield its ally, Israel.

Fourteen of the 15 Council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza "must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released".

Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document "abandoned" the necessity for there to be "a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages".

Critics of the veto sharply rebuked the US, with France saying it "deeply regretted" the move.

The UNSC is composed of five permanent members which have veto power - and 10 which are elected.

This group proposed the draft resolution which also "rejected any effort to starve Palestinians".

The vote was held as the UN warned that Palestinians were "facing diminishing conditions for survival" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because [virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo)
.

Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza.

The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals.

Ambassador Wood said passing the resolution would have sent a "dangerous message" to Hamas, the armed group at war with Israel, that "there's no need to come back to the negotiating table".

Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said the resolution "was not a path to peace, it was a roadmap to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed".

"Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto," he added.

Hamas, meanwhile, accused the US of being "directly responsible" for Israel's "genocidal war" in Gaza.

Reacting to the veto, China's ambassador said people could not help but ask: "Do Palestinian lives mean nothing?"

France said international humanitarian law was being trampled and the only response should have been an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

The UK said it wanted to end the war, stop the suffering in Gaza and secure the immediate release of all hostages.

But the harshest criticism of the US came from outside the Council doors.

Human Rights Watch's (HRW) UN director, Louis Charbonneau, accused Washington of "once again" using its veto power "to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza".

Israel rejects the accusations.

The current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 251 into Gaza as hostages.

More than 43,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
