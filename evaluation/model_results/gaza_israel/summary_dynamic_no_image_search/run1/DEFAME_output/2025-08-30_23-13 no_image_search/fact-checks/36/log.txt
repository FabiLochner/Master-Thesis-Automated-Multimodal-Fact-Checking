The claim 'Gallant, a retired military general and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet, was killed in the Iranian attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) shows Gallant alive and making statements on October 1, 2024. Further, NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) and Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant)) confirm he was later fired and resigned, thus contradicting the claim of his death on October 1, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
