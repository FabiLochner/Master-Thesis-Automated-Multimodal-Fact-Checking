Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/satellite-images-show-damage-from-israeli-strikes-at-2-secretive-iranian-military-bases): 
Content: The PBS News article, published on October 27, 2024, discusses Israeli strikes on Iranian military bases on October 26, 2024. The strikes damaged facilities at the Parchin military base <image:10522> and the Khojir military base <image:10523>. The article includes satellite images of the damage.

The claim '<image:10203> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. While evidence confirms that Israel launched attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, the provided image's connection to those attacks remains unverified. The attacks targeted military sites, and satellite images of damaged facilities are available, but the image in the claim is not confirmed to depict the attacks.

So, the overall veracity is: false
