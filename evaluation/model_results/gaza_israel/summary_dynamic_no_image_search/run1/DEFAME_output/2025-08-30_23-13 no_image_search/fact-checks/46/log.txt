Content: The search result from Dublin Live, published on November 3, 2024, discusses a music legend criticizing Bono and Bob Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza, contrasting it with their activism during Live Aid in the 1980s.

Content: The BBC published an article on November 24, 2024, discussing the 40th anniversary of Band Aid and the controversy surrounding it. The article mentions Bob Geldof and Bono. <image:11428>, <image:11430>.

The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While Bob Geldof and Bono were involved in the 40th anniversary of Band Aid in November 2024, and faced criticism regarding their silence on the situation in Gaza, there is no evidence of a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army, as indicated by the search results from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof), [Dublin Live](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394), and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dl22gz3vlo).
