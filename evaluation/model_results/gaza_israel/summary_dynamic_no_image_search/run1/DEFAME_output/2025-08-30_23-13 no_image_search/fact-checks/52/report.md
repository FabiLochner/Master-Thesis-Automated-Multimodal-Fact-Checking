## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023.

CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with about 100,000 Palestinians leaving Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks.

The Times of Israel also reports a 6% decline in Gaza's population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source, an article by the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% *decrease* in Gaza's population since the war began on the same date, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

The discrepancy could be due to different methodologies, data sources, or the time frame considered. The NYCFPA article's reliance on pre-war growth forecasts might not account for the impact of the conflict. The CNN and Times of Israel reports, citing the PCBS, appear to reflect actual population changes during the war, including migration and casualties.

Therefore, the claim is likely false, as the more recent reports indicate a population decrease, not an increase.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information. While one source claims a 2.02% increase in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, based on pre-war forecasts, other sources report a 6% decrease during the same period, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. The latter reports appear to reflect actual population changes during the war.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While one source, the NYCFPA, states a 2.02% population increase since October 7, 2023, based on pre-war forecasts ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)), CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% decrease during the same period, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics ([Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl), [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)). The latter reports reflect actual population changes during the war.
