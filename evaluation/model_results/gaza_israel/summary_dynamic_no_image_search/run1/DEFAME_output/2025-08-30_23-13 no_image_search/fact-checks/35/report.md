## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 10219](media/35.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10219](media/35.jpg) is of rings and a piece of paper. According to the website "[Hakikah](https://hakikah.net/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%9F/)", the image was previously circulated in January and April 2024, with different claims. The website "[Kashif](https://kashif.ps/%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A5%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7/) " also states that the image is old and was previously shared on social media in January 2024.

The website "[Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail’in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah’ın yüzükleri mi?](https://www.sahneprojesi.org/blog-yazilari/fotograftakiler-israilin-saldirisinda-olen-nasrallahin-yuzukleri-mi/)" states that the image is not recent and was actually from January 7, 2024, and the rings belonged to Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image has been circulating since January 2024, and the rings belonged to Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari.


## Final Judgement
The image has been circulating since January 2024, and the rings belonged to someone else. The claim that the image shows the remains of Nasrallah's ring after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024, is therefore not accurate.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is not recent and has been circulating since January 2024, with the rings belonging to Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, according to sources like [Hakikah](https://hakikah.net/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%9F/) and [Fotoğraftakiler, İsrail’in saldırısında ölen Nasrallah’ın yüzükleri mi?](https://www.sahneprojesi.org/blog-yazilari/fotograftakiler-israilin-saldirisinda-olen-nasrallahin-yuzukleri-mi/).
