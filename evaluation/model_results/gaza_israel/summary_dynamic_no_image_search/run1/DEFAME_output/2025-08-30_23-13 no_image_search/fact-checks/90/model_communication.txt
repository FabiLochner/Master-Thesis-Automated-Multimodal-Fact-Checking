**An Algerian judoka has been disqualified after failing the weigh-in before facing an Israeli opponent at the Olympic Games.**

Messaoud Redouane Dris, 22, had been scheduled to face Tohar Butbul in the -73kg category on Monday.

However, Dris weighed in above the 73kg limit ahead of the contest and was removed from the draw.

Games organisers confirmed his disqualification and awarded Butbul a walkover to the next round.

Algeria's judo federation and national Olympic committee are yet to comment.

The Israeli Olympic Committee alleged his failure to compete had been deliberate and was strongly critical of the Algerian.

"Tohar's competitor has removed himself from the competition," the Israeli body said in a statement.

"The Israeli delegation will continue to compete with the Olympic values in mind, we believe this kind of behaviour has no place in the world of sport."

Another Algerian judoka, Fethi Nourine, was [handed a 10-year ban](/sport/olympics/58556940)
 by the International Judo Federation after withdrawing from a bout against Butbul at the Tokyo Games in 2021.

In that specific case, Nourine said at the time that his political support for the Palestinian cause made it impossible for him to compete.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Redouane Messaoud Dris, an Algerian judoka, was disqualified from the Olympics after failing to weigh-in before his match against Israel's Tohar Butbul, according to the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo)) <image:12291>. ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) <image:12295> and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) <image:i> also reported on the incident, with the IJF investigating the situation.

The incident marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul in the past two Olympics.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Redouane Messaoud Dris, an Algerian judoka, was disqualified from the Olympics after failing to weigh-in before his match against Israel's Tohar Butbul. The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo)), ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) all reported on the incident.

The evidence supports the claim that an Algerian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent. However, the reason for the withdrawal was a failure to weigh-in, not a direct withdrawal.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that an Algerian judoka, Redouane Messaoud Dris, did not compete against an Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the Olympics. However, the reason was a failure to weigh-in, not a direct withdrawal.

`true`

  !A workmen measures a door in a building damaged by an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 19. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack as part of its support for Palestinians.**

Drone strikes Tel Aviv, killing one. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.

The drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The Houthis say they are acting to show solidarity with the Palestinians over the war in Gaza, though the civilian shipping traffic involves vessels from around the world.

Tel Aviv came under heavy rocket fire from Hamas in the early weeks of the war last fall, but the attacks have long since stopped. Houthis claim responsibility** **The deadly drone slammed into an apartment building on the Tel Aviv oceanfront just after 3 a.m. <image:12306>

Israeli police investigate the scene of a drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel on Friday. But this attack apparently caught Israeli forces off-guard.

Sirens typically provide a warning when Tel Aviv or other cities come under aerial attack. The official described it as "human error." The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.

Given the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.

The Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone "capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. Hamas occasionally fires rockets into southern Israel.

The main aerial threat to Israel has been coming from the north, with Hezbollah and Israel trading rocket fire across the border on a daily basis.

Houthis Launch New Wave of Attacks
==================================

! But, global officials and most experts had, until the Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, broadly assumed that the Houthis would continue to focus their response to the Gaza war on [attacking commercial shipping](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-march-26/)
 in the Red Sea. The attacks came after the latest in a series of lulls in Houthi attacks on shipping – halts that, in the past, led to speculation that the [Houthi weapons arsenals](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-january-22/)
 might be running low.

The Houthi strike on Tel Aviv has moved the group from the margins of the Gaza conflict to the center of diplomacy and the allied strategy to try to end the fighting permanently. and its allies have used to try to end the Houthi strikes on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have failed to deter the group.
*   The Houthis’ ability to continue striking targets in and around Yemen suggests their missile and drone arsenal was more extensive than was believed and the group might still be receiving resupply from Iran.
*   Israel’s retaliation on an oil refinery at Hodeidah could complicate U.S.-led efforts to contain the Houthi threat and potentially expand regional warfare even further.

**The threat to regional peace and security posed by the [Houthi movement (Ansarallah)](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-june-11/)
 in Yemen expanded Friday when the group launched an explosive-laden drone on Tel Aviv in the pre-dawn hours, striking an apartment building and killing an Israeli man while wounding several others.** The drone reportedly flew near the U.S. forces but later assessed the attack was by Israel, and quoted Yemen’s Health Ministry as reporting the strike had killed and wounded several persons.

The Houthi attack on Tel Aviv demonstrated that U.S. The Houthi attacks have reduced commercial ship traffic by nearly half, but otherwise produced no measurable effect on Israeli, U.S., or global policy on the Gaza war or the broader region.

The Tel Aviv drone strike came days after the Houthis demonstrated they still have an ample and varied supply of weaponry in their arsenal. escalation against the Houthis has the potential to further expand the Gaza crisis into a regional conflagration.

**Bottom Line up Front**

*   On Friday, the Houthi movement in Yemen sought to implement its threats against Israel by conducting a strike on Tel Aviv with an Iranian-made long-range drone.
*   The diplomatic, military, and economic tools the U.S. Two attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted ships in the Red Sea on July 15, even as the U.S. The spokesman said that Tel Aviv will continue to be a primary target for the terror group “within the range of our weapons.”

The attack rattled the Israeli security establishment, which has prided itself on fielding the most sophisticated missile, rocket, and drone defense in the region, if not the world."

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on a drone strike in Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024, for which the Houthi militia claimed responsibility, resulting in one fatality. ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/g-s1-12197/drone-strikes-tel-aviv-killing-one-houthis-claim-responsibility](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/g-s1-12197/drone-strikes-tel-aviv-killing-one-houthis-claim-responsibility)) The Soufan Center also discussed a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv with an Iranian-made long-range drone, which occurred in the pre-dawn hours, killing one Israeli man and wounding several others. ([https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-july-22/](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-july-22/))

Wikipedia discusses a 2024 Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, and mentions a subsequent Israeli attack on Yemen on July 20, 2024. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen)) The image <image:10253> is not mentioned in the search result.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:10253>) appears in multiple sources. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center ([FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel)) published the image in a news release on October 7, 2023, condemning attacks on Israel. The image also appears on TURDEF ([Israel Defence News - TURDEF](https://turdef.com/country/israel-news?page=5)) with the title "Second Yom Kippur War in Israel" and a release date of October 7, 2023.

The Times of Israel ([The Daily Edition | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-daily-edition/2023-10-07/)) published an article on October 7, 2023, detailing the Hamas attack on Israel, which included images of the aftermath of rocket attacks. The image <image:10253> is not mentioned in the article.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024 is false. The reverse image search reveals that the image was published in October 2023, in the context of the Hamas attack on Israel.

 Computers running [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS")

### Remedy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Remedy")\
\]

Affected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet")
, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[23\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike.com-240719-23)

If crashes persisted, remediation required booting into [safe mode](/wiki/Safe_mode "Safe mode")
 or the [Windows Recovery Environment](/wiki/Windows_Recovery_Environment "Windows Recovery Environment")
 and deleting any `.sys` file beginning with `C-00000291-` and with timestamp 04:09 UTC in the `[%windir%](/wiki/%25windir%25 "%windir%") \[System32](/wiki/Special_folder#File_system_directories "Special folder") \[drivers](/wiki/Driver_(computing) "Driver (computing)") \CrowdStrike\` directory.[\[28\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike_072024-28)
 As this process needed to be done locally on each individual machine, it was "expected to take days" for affected businesses to restore all systems.[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Technical staff needed to reboot the affected computers individually with manual intervention on each system.[\[33\]](#cite_note-CSI_1-33)
[\[34\]](#cite_note-HOB_1-34)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-CSW_1-35)

On devices with Windows' [BitLocker](/wiki/BitLocker "BitLocker")
 disk encryption enabled, which corporations often use to increase security, fixing the problem was exacerbated because the 48-digit numeric Bitlocker recovery keys (unique to each system) required manual input, with additional challenges supplying the recovery keys to end users working remotely.

 After the ground stop left too many crew members in the wrong places, Delta struggled to assemble enough pilots and flight attendants at airport gates to operate scheduled flights.[\[127\]](#cite_note-Yamanouchi3-127)
 Many flights were repeatedly delayed and finally cancelled because the one or two crew members who made it to the gate for a particular flight kept hitting their legal [flight time](/wiki/Flight_time "Flight time")

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

Rob D'Amico, a former FBI supervisory special agent, appears on CNN on Friday, July 19.

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

Flight cancellations into or out of the US have topped 3,000 flights as of 8:40 p.m. “But at that point, the damage had been done, and we now had to move into manual mode.”

In manual mode, it takes a village to reboot computer devices and reload operating systems, DeWalt said, adding some of the companies “spent the entire night deploying thousands of people by hand reloading operating systems, starting servers back up again.”

After discovering the problem wasn’t an attack, but rather a conflict with a Microsoft update that occurred earlier, the group had to race against the clock.

The ongoing global IT outage is impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.

Marriott International has nearly 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, according to the company’s website.

**Impact at other hotels:** An assistant manager at the Hilton Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, said they have been having to manually unlock guests’ rooms because the outage impacted the software the hotel uses to make key cards.  

A CNN team saw guests at the hotel using chairs as doorstoppers to keep their doors from closing when they had to leave.

Businesses worldwide grappled with an ongoing major IT outage Friday, as financial services and doctors' offices were disrupted, while some TV broadcasters went offline. Air travel has been hit particularly hard, with planes grounded, services delayed and airports issuing advice to passengers.

The outage came as cybersecurity giant [CrowdStrike experienced a major disruption](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-suffers-major-outage-affecting-businesses-around-the-world.html)
 early Friday following an issue with a recent tech update.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has since said that the company is "actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts," stressing that Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.

"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. He emphasized again that the outage was not caused by a security breach or cyberattack.

"As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again," he wrote.

Over 10,000 Israelis relocate to Canada since early 2024
========================================================

Published :  

15-11-2024 13:13|

[World](/section/4)

Since Oct. 7, 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in the number of "Israelis" seeking to relocate to Canada, "Israeli" newspaper Haaretz reported.

Reports from Canadian immigration authorities show that over 10,000 "Israelis" made the move to Canada in early 2024, with around 8,000 of them obtaining work visas. This marks a significant jump compared to previous years.

While political unrest and escalating violence in the region are major contributors, many "Israelis" cite dissatisfaction with the state of the country’s political system and social inequalities as additional driving forces behind their decision to leave.

Data from the Canadian Ministry of Immigration reveals that between December 2023 and September 2024, a total of 3,425 temporary work visas were approved for "Israelis", out of 3,705 applications.

Moreover, "Israeli" media outlets such as Yedioth Ahronoth reported that even before the aggression on Gaza reached its current intensity, there was a rising trend in the number of "Israelis" choosing to emigrate

Chinese travel agencies have canceled trips to Israel amid the escalated conflict there, which flared up over the weekend. Chinese airlines have adjusted flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.  
   
"We quickly screened all orders after the conflict broke out, and as of now, our company has no tourists stranded in Israel," Tongcheng Travel told the Global Times on Monday morning.   
  
For travel groups planning to travel to Israel in October and November, the company communicated with those clients and processed full refunds. In addition, business work related to tourism in Israel has been temporarily suspended, the agency noted.   
  
GZL International Travel Service told the Global Times that it has decided to cancel all travel groups to Israel in October. It sent two travel groups to the country in September, but both have since returned to China.    
  
Chinese travel agency Spring Tour confirmed to the Global Times that the company has canceled a 28-member tour to Israel that was scheduled to depart on Monday, given the escalated tensions there, and tours departing after that point will be subject to notifications from relevant departments and the actual situation on the ground.  
  
The move came after the escalated conflict there, as Israel's cabinet declared a "state of war" on Sunday against Hamas, in which at least 700 in Israel died while retaliatory Israeli airstrikes killed at least 413 in Gaza, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.  
  
On August 10 , the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the third list of countries, including Israel, to resume outbound group tours.  
   
China's Hainan Airlines, the only carrier in China with flights to Israel, told the Global Times that it canceled flights between Shanghai and Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday due to the ongoing high tensions there, and will adjust flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.   
  
The airline has three direct flights between China and the country, which depart from Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, operating twice a week on each route.  
  
Data shared by the information provider VariFlight showed that the flight from Shenzhen to Tel Aviv on Tuesday was canceled.  
  
The airline later said on its official Weibo on Monday afternoon that its follow-up flight plans for Israel routes will continue to be implemented. There has been no adjustment for the time being in an effort to maximize and ensure the normal travel of passengers.  
  
It will pay close attention to changes in the overseas security situation and dynamically adjust relevant flight plans as soon as possible, the airline said.   
  
The Foreign Ministry activated the emergency consular protection mechanism immediately after the conflict broke out to coordinate and engage in work on protecting Chinese nationals and institutions in Palestine and Israel, said Mao Ning, ministry spokesperson, on Monday. The spokesperson reminded Chinese nationals not to travel to Palestine or Israel.   
  
We would like to once again call on relevant parties to immediately stop the fighting, protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation. Mao said.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

Content: "![People gather at the scene of an deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024. They \[the government\] have to go,” the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza.

Until the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.

[Hezbollah in southern Lebanon](/news/2024/7/17/hezbollah-threatens-to-fire-on-new-israeli-targets)
 has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.

Following the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as “a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters”.

It said the Yemeni fighters were supporting “the heroic” Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending “all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations”.

The group said the fight will not stop until “the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”.

The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also praised the Houthi rebels for “a new heroic operation” against Israel, adding that Palestinians appreciated the “steadfast” support of Gaza.

Yemen’s [Houthi group](/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide)
 has claimed responsibility for an apparent drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, which killed one person and injured at least 10.

A spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media on Friday that the Iran-aligned group had “targeted ‘Tel Aviv’ in occupied Palestine”.

It claimed that it used a new drone “capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being unable to be detected by radars”.

The Israeli military said it had opened an investigation into the large explosion near the United States embassy office in the city and would determine why the country’s air defence systems were not activated to intercept the “aerial target”.

“We’re talking about a large UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] that can fly large distances,” a military official told a briefing for journalists following the strike. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on July 19, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where police said one person was found dead.

Israel’s air force has increased patrols to “protect the country’s skies”, the military said in a post on social media.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised retaliation.

“We will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,” Israeli Army Radio quoted Gallant as saying.

Israeli police said the body of a man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and that the circumstances were being investigated.

Footage from the site of the blast showed broken glass strewn across pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. The site was sealed off by police tape.

Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.

The Israeli government has [banned Al Jazeera](/news/2024/5/6/israel-bans-al-jazeera-what-does-it-mean-and-what-happens-next)
 from broadcasting from the country.

“Where this drone hit is a part of the city that is very close to the US embassy branch office. It’s a very densely populated area, a high-security area,” Jamjoom said.

If the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel’s radar systems undetected, “there’s going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means”, said Jamjoom.

“How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable “offensive response”.

Israeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was “further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel”.

“Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv."

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting Ben Gurion Airport, and a drone attack on Tel Aviv on the same day. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10255> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("airport crowd after attack July 19 2024")
reverse_search(<image:10255>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

Following renewed Houthi missile threats, major airlines have extended flight suspensions to Israel, citing escalating security risks near Ben Gurion Airport.

![Houthi Israel Airport](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi militia has again threatened to strike Israel’s main international gateway, Ben Gurion Airport (TLV), raising concerns over flight safety and prompting international [airline](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/topic/airlines/)
 responses.

**Details on Houthis’ threats to Israel and Ben Gurion Airport** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer posted a photo of TLV on social media platform X with the warning: “In the coming hours, Yemeni forces will carry out military operations against Ben Gurion and other Zionist airports.” The statement mirrored recent IDF evacuation alerts for Houthi-held Yemeni ports.

The latest threat marks the second in 24 hours. Earlier, Amer warned: “We will strike Ben Gurion Airport in the coming hours. Evacuate immediately.” Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Amer urged international airlines to avoid TLV and Israeli airspace: “They should change course and take seriously the warnings of the Yemeni military… not only over Ben Gurion Airport but over all of Israeli airspace.”

In response, the Israeli Air Force [bombed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7050j07gedo)
 key Houthi infrastructure, including Sanaa Airport (SAH).

Amid the rising threat, several international airlines have suspended flights to Israel. Let’s keep exploring the future of aviation together!

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

The image could be related to the IT outage or security concerns, but the claim's specific context is not supported by the evidence.
