Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html): 
Content: The Yahoo News article, published on July 29, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated quote attributed to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The quote, which claims Johnson said, "I've seen a lot of evil in Hollywood scripts â€” but nothing compares to what Israel is doing in Gaza. The Israeli government and its Prime Minister Netanyahu are heartless criminals with no shred of humanity," is rated as "Incorrect Attribution" by Snopes. The article states that there is no credible record of Johnson making such a statement. The original post of the quote was found on an X account named Global Lens News (@Global_Lens_New). <image:12380>, <image:12381>, <image:12382>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/): 
Content: The search result from Myth Detector, published on August 5, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson regarding Israel. The quote, which condemns the Israeli government, is not found on Johnson's official social media accounts. The article includes images of the fabricated quote and mentions that the quote has also been fact-checked by Snopes. <image:12397>, <image:12392>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/reverse-image-search-for-fake-photos/): 
Content: The AARP article mentions that a quick search can debunk images, such as the one of Lionel Messi holding an Israeli flag. It also states that Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has appeared in T-shirts that make contentious political statements.

The claim '<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel, the image of him wearing the Israeli flag is likely fabricated, as indicated by fact-checking articles from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
