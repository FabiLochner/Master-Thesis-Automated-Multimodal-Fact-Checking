Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2024_Israeli_airstrikes_in_Yemen):

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-12-26-2024-2e8c33648410c2da94ae7d0d73c0b1a1): 
Content: The Associated Press reports on Israeli airstrikes in Yemen on December 26, 2024, targeting the Houthi rebel-held capital and multiple ports. The World Health Organization's director-general was nearby during the strikes. The strikes followed Houthi launches towards Israel. The Israeli military stated that the strikes targeted infrastructure used by the Houthis for smuggling Iranian weapons and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. <image:1>

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the U.S. did conduct airstrikes in Yemen on December 22, 2024, the claim incorrectly states the reason for the strikes. The U.S. strikes were in response to Houthi attacks, not in retaliation for an attack on Israel's capital. Furthermore, Israel also conducted airstrikes in Yemen during December 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
