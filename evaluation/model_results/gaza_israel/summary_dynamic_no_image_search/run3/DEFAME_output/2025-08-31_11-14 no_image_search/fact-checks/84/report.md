## Claim
Claim: "![image 53](media/84.jpg) This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
geolocate(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) of Benjamin Netanyahu's house predates the claim. It was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_ and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The _Times of Israel_ published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, but the image was not present in the article. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow".

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The image predates the claim, as it was published in 2019 and 2020. The _Times of Israel_ published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house, but the image was not present in the article. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow". The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Israel, but also in other countries.

The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The image was taken before August 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false because the image predates the date mentioned in the claim. The image was published in 2019 and 2020, while the claim states it was taken in August 2024. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim, which purports to show Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is demonstrably false. Reverse image searches reveal that the image was published in 2019 and 2020, predating the date specified in the claim, as evidenced by articles from the _Times of Israel_ and other sources ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).
