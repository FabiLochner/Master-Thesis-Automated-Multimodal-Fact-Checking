It also mentions that Turkey and Israel held talks in April 2025. The RUSI article discusses the relationship between Turkey and Israel, mentioning that in March 2022, President Isaac Herzog visited Ankara.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Erdogan made comments regarding Israel's involvement in Syria. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The Levant24.com article mentions that Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel's involvement, and the Madamasr.com article mentions a meeting between Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President in May 2025.

The RUSI article discusses the relationship between Turkey and Israel, mentioning events in March 2022 and April 2025, but it does not provide information about Erdogan's actions in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

The JINSA article ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/erdogan-lambasts-israel-for-undermining-stability-in-syria)) reports that Erdogan lambasted Israel for undermining stability in Syria. Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/)) reports that Erdogan spoke with President Trump on March 16, 2025, discussing Syria, but does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel. ![image 12247](media/2025-08-31_12-09-1756642145-901287.jpg), ![image 12248](media/2025-08-31_12-09-1756642147-805854.jpg), ![image 12249](media/2025-08-31_12-09-1756642150-977579.jpg)


## Elaboration

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/): 
Content: The Armenian Weekly published an article on August 5, 2025, discussing the strategic contest for influence between Turkey and Israel in Syria. The article mentions that Turkey and Israel are the leading external powers influencing territorial reconfigurations and institutional developments in Syria. It also states that Turkish military forces intervened in northern Syria in March 2025. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Turkey and Israel were competing for influence in Syria in March 2025, with Turkish military forces intervening in northern Syria. However, the search results do not provide any information about Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that in March 2025, Erdogan made strong statements against Israel and discussed Syria with the U.S. However, the search results do not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel. The claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The available evidence does not support the claim. While Turkish President Erdogan made statements against Israel and discussed Syria with the U.S. in March 2025, there is no evidence to suggest that he urged the U.S. to control Israel. The search results from [JINSA](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/erdogan-lambasts-israel-for-undermining-stability-in-syria), and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/) do not provide any information about Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.
