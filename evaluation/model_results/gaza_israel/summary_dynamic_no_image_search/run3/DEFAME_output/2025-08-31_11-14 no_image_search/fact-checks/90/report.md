## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics. An Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for "smartly avoiding meeting \[the] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight". ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg), <image:i>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics. Dris failed to make weight, which prevented the match. An Algerian newspaper suggested that Dris avoided the match.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple reliable sources confirms that the Algerian judoka did not compete against his Israeli opponent due to failing to make weight. This aligns with the claim that the Algerian judo athlete withdrew from the match.

`true`
