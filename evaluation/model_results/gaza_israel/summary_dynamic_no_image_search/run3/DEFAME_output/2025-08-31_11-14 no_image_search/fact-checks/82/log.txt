Useful result: From [Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/): 
Content: The article from Kashif, published on August 25, 2024, discusses an old photo of Israeli ministers in a shelter, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The article states that the photo was taken on October 7, 2023, and was republished with the false claim that it was taken during Hezbollah's recent bombing of sites in Israel. <image:12287>, <image:12285>. The article mentions that the Israeli occupation army launched preemptive strikes on southern Lebanon on August 25, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/25/israels-attack-lebanon-peace-further-out-of-reach): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, discussing the escalation of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The article mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. <image:12289>, <image:12290>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-september-27-2024/): 
Content: The Times of Israel's live blog from September 27, 2024, reports on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. It mentions rocket sirens in several areas, including Tel Aviv and Safed, and an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. The IDF announced airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. The article also mentions that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right allies, including Bezalel Smotrich, hailed his UN speech. <image:51>
The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, but the photo was taken on October 7, 2023, not during an attack on August 25, 2024, as stated in the claim, according to the [Kashif article](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
