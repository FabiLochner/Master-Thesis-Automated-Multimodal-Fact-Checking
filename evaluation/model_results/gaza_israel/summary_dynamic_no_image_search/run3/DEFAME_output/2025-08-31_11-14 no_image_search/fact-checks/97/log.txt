Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4p9rg8zlo): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on November 21, 2024, discusses the US vetoing a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council (<image:12406>). The article does not mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US.

The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check, based on multiple web searches, found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results focused on the US's involvement in the conflict, including military aid and diplomatic efforts, but did not mention the reinstitution of the draft. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.

So, the overall veracity is: false
