## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html): Found exact image on website with title: Residents in Nabatieh 'frightened' but determined to 'stay' after ...
Content: The search result from L'Orient Today shows an image that matches the one in the claim. The article is about an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, which injured nine people. ![image 39](media/65.jpg) is the same image as the one in the article.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, which targeted multiple locations, including Deir al-Balah, and resulted in over 591 deaths. The attacks began on March 18, 2025, and ended the 2025 Gaza war ceasefire.

An Al Jazeera article from May 7, 2025, reports on Israeli attacks in Gaza, including an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah, which resulted in three deaths. ![image 39](media/65.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image in the claim is not from Deir al-Balah in March 2025. The reverse image search indicates that the image is from an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024. The web search confirms that there were attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but the provided image does not depict this event. The web search also mentions an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah in May 2025.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, not Deir al-Balah in March 2025. While there were attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, the image does not depict this event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, as indicated by a reverse image search ([Source](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)). While there were attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, the image does not depict this event.
