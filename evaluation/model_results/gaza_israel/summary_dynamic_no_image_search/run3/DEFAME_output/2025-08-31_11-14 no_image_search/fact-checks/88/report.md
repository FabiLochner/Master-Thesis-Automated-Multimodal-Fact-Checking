### Evidence from `web_search`
The Nairaland Forum post discusses a photo of Esmail Qaani in a hijab, which circulated during the Israel-Hezbollah war, suggesting his escape after an attempt on his life in Lebanon. The post was published on June 27. The JFeed article, published on June 25, 2025, discusses rumors that Qaani might be a spy for Israel’s Mossad, which gained traction after his disappearance following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on October 4, 2024. The New Arab reports that Esmail Qaani is in good health and includes a photo of him. <image:k>

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab has been circulating online, with claims that he was in disguise due to fear of Israeli airstrikes. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses this theory. However, another source mentions rumors that Qaani might be a spy for Israel's Mossad. The New Arab reports that Qaani is in good health.

Based on the evidence, it is difficult to definitively confirm the claim. The image's authenticity is not disputed, but the reason for the disguise is uncertain. The evidence presents conflicting narratives, including fear of airstrikes and potential espionage.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the context of the image and the reason for Qaani's appearance in a hijab.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on Esmail Qaani mentions that he was allegedly placed under house arrest and interrogated on accusations of being an Israeli spy. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy published an article discussing Esmail Qaani's appointment as the chief commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. Getty Images provides multiple photos of Esmail Qaani in various settings.

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani), [https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/who-esmail-qaani-new-chief-commander-irans-qods-force](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/who-esmail-qaani-new-chief-commander-irans-qods-force), and [https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/esmail-ghaani](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/esmail-ghaani).


## Elaboration
The additional evidence provides more context about Esmail Qaani. The Wikipedia article mentions that he was allegedly interrogated on accusations of being an Israeli spy. This information adds another layer of complexity to the claim.

The evidence does not confirm the claim that the image is authentic and that Qaani was disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing. However, the information about the accusations of being an Israeli spy raises questions about the image's context.

More information is needed to determine the image's context and the reason for Qaani's appearance in a hijab.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post published an undated picture of Esmail Qaani in Tehran, Iran. <image:k> The Middle East Eye reported that Qaani attended a funeral in Tehran on October 15, 2024, and included photos of him in military uniform. <image:k> The article also mentioned that Qaani had not been seen in public since an Israeli air strike in Lebanon and discussed speculation about his whereabouts.

The sources are: [https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988) and [https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-quds-force-head-esmail-qaani-attends-generals-funeral-tehran](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-quds-force-head-esmail-qaani-attends-generals-funeral-tehran).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Esmail Qaani has been seen in Tehran, Iran, and attended a funeral there. The Middle East Eye reported that Qaani had not been seen in public since an Israeli air strike in Lebanon, which led to speculation about his whereabouts. However, the provided evidence does not specify the location of the image in the hijab.

Based on the available information, it is impossible to verify the claim. The evidence does not provide the context of the image or the reason for Qaani's appearance in a hijab.


## Final Judgement
The image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab has circulated online with claims that he was in disguise due to fear of Israeli airstrikes. However, there are conflicting narratives, including rumors of him being a spy. The evidence does not confirm the claim, and additional information is needed to determine the image's context and the reason for Qaani's appearance in a hijab.

The claim is not factually accurate because the context of the image is not confirmed, and there are conflicting narratives. Therefore, the claim is taken out of context. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While the image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab is authentic, the context surrounding it is uncertain. The evidence presents conflicting narratives, including the possibility of disguise due to fear of Israeli airstrikes and rumors of espionage, making it impossible to verify the claim's accuracy.
