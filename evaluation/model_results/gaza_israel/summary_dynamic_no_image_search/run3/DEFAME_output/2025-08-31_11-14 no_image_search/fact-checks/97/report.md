The provided search results discuss the United States' support for Israel in the Gaza war, including military aid, meetings between officials, and vetoes of UN resolutions (<image:k>, <image:i>, <image:j>). Another source discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza, with the US expected to vote on it. None of the sources mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US.

*   [The return of the military draft](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/07/the-return-of-the-military-draft.html)

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Final Judgement
The search results do not provide any evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence focuses on the US's involvement in the war, including military aid and diplomatic efforts, but does not mention the reinstitution of the draft.
