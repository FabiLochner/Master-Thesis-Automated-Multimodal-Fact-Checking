## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 22, 2024, CNN reported that Kamala Harris was in Maryland and was expected to underscore a commitment to Israel's defense, while also reiterating concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza (<image:k>). The Washington Post reported that Harris declined to preside over the Senate chamber when Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress on July 22, 2024. The Guardian published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Harris's approach to Netanyahu's visit, mentioning that she is likely to engage in public criticism of Netanyahu and focus on the civilian toll in Gaza (![image 12114](media/2025-08-31_11-54-1756641297-913542.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The CNN article states that Kamala Harris was expected to underscore a commitment to Israel's defense on July 22, 2024, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not provide the exact quote.

Therefore, the claim is neither confirmed nor refuted. The exact wording of Harris's statement is missing.
