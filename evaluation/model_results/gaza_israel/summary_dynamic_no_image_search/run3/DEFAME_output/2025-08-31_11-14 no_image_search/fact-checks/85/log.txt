Content: The search result from AAP FactCheck, published on August 08, 2024, states that the image in the claim has been digitally manipulated. <image:12292> The original image is from a News 12 broadcast in May 2022.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.haaretz.com/ty-tag/yigal-amir-0000017f-da25-d718-a5ff-faa5f9030000): Found exact image on website with title: Yigal Amir - Haaretz
Content: The search result contains the exact image from the claim. The image is a screenshot from Channel 12. <image:54>

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image presented in the claim is a digitally altered version of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, addressed the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism, but the image was manipulated to include a fabricated question about soldiers and rape, as confirmed by multiple sources, including the [AAP FactCheck](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/digital-manipulation-distorts-israeli-tv-poll/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
