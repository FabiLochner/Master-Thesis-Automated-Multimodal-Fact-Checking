## Evidence

The ACLU ([https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil)) also reported on Khalil's arrest in March 2025, with his legal team claiming the arrest was retaliatory.

CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/world/mahmoud-khalil-ice-detention-amanpour-interview-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/world/mahmoud-khalil-ice-detention-amanpour-interview-intl-hnk)) published an article on July 11, 2025, discussing the ICE detention of Mahmoud Khalil, mentioning protests against his arrest and his claims of poor treatment in detention. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo): 
Content: The BBC published an article on June 20, 2025, about Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, facing deportation from the U.S. ![image 12052](media/2025-08-31_11-48-1756640936-395329.jpg), ![image 12055](media/2025-08-31_11-48-1756640937-151366.jpg), ![image 12053](media/2025-08-31_11-48-1756640936-536614.jpg). Khalil was arrested by immigration agents, and his arrest was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators. A judge ruled on June 20, 2025, that Khalil must be released. The article mentions Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests.
