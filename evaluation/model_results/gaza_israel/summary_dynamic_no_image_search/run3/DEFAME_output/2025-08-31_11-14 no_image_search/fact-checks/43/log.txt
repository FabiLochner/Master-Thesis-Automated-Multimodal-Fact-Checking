Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html): 
Content: The Yahoo article fact-checks the quote "Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine." attributed to Anthony Bourdain. The article states that it has been unable to find any credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement. The oldest version of the quote found with Bourdain's name attached was from July 2021. The article also mentions similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, suggesting the quote was misattributed. The article includes a photo of Anthony Bourdain <image:12056>. The article also mentions Bourdain's visit to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for a CNN show episode.

The claim 'Anthony Bourdain once said, 'Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. A fact-check by Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html)) found no credible evidence of Anthony Bourdain making the statement, and the quote's attribution to him appears to be recent.

So, the overall veracity is: false
