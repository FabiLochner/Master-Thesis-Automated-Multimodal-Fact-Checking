The image in the claim, which appears to be a social media post, was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts. The image includes an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass and the words, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way." The post was debunked by the independent Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar.
