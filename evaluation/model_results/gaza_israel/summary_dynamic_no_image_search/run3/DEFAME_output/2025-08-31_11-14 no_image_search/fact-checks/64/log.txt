Content: The search result from Anadolu Agency, published on June 25, 2025, reports that Esmail Qaani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, appeared in Tehran during celebrations, contradicting earlier reports of his assassination. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/): 
Content: The IranWire article, published on October 7, 2024, reports that there has been no news regarding the whereabouts of Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force, in recent days. <image:k>, <image:l>, <image:m>. The article mentions that Qaani was last seen in Lebanonâ€™s southern suburbs of Beirut on September 29, 2024. The article also mentions that Israeli media reported that the possibility of Qaani being injured in a bomb explosion is under investigation.

The claim 'Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Jerusalem Post indicates a denial of ties to Qaani, and the Anadolu Agency reported his presence in Tehran in June 2025, contradicting the claim that he fled to Israel in April 2025. An IranWire article also indicates his last known location was in Lebanon in September 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
