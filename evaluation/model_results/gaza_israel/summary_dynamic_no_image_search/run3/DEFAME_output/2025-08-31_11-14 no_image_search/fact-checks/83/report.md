### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows a group of people holding an Israeli flag. The search results include information about Josep Sunyol, who was the president of FC Barcelona from 1935 to 1936. One source is a Wikipedia article about Josep Sunyol ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep\_Sunyol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Sunyol)). Another source is from the official FC Barcelona website ([https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/card/645396/josep-sunol-1935-1936](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/card/645396/josep-sunol-1935-1936)) and discusses Josep Suñol. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The image depicts Joan Laporta, the current president of FC Barcelona, with representatives of the Israeli embassy. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, not in September 2024. The claim also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, but the evidence does not specify if the event took place during the war.

The claim is inaccurate regarding the date.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Joan Laporta, the president of FC Barcelona, with representatives of the Israeli embassy. This event happened on February 16, 2023, not in September 2024.
