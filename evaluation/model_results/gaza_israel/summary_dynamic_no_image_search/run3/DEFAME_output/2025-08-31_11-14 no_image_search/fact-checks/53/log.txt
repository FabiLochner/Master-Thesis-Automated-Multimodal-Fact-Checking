The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, "I hope that America obliterates Israel" is not supported by the evidence. While Trump did post on Truth Social on that date, as confirmed by sources like CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago)) and the Tennessee Lookout ([Source](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)), the specific quote is not found in any of the provided search results, including archives of his posts and news reports about his activities on that day.

So, the overall veracity is: false
