Justification: The claim is false. While an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, during which Netanyahu remained in Israel and convened the Security Cabinet, as reported by sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next). There is no evidence to support the claim that he left Israel and fled to Poland on that date.
