## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The DW article ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)) fact-checks the claim that UNRWA is mourning the death of Yahya Sinwar, stating the black ribbon was added to show solidarity with war victims, and was present since at least October 22, 2023. The CFI UK news article ([https://www.cfi.org.uk/news.php?article=811](https://www.cfi.org.uk/news.php?article=811)) discusses the controversy surrounding UNRWA and its support for Hamas, mentioning that UNRWA stated the black stripe was added in October 2023 when the death toll of UNRWA members reached 20.

France 24 published an article ([https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20241021-what-we-know-about-the-unrwa-id-allegedly-found-amidst-sinwar-s-belongings](https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20241021-what-we-know-about-the-unrwa-id-allegedly-found-amidst-sinwar-s-belongings)) on October 21, 2024, discussing an "UNRWA ID" allegedly found among Yahya Sinwar's belongings. ![image 1](media/0.jpg) ![image 18](media/24.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The black band on the UNRWA logo was added to show solidarity with war victims, not to mourn Yahya Sinwar. The DW article ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)) explicitly states this. Furthermore, the black stripe was present since at least October 22, 2023, and the CFI UK news article ([https://www.cfi.org.uk/news.php?article=811](https://www.cfi.org.uk/news.php?article=811)) mentions that UNRWA stated the black stripe was added in October 2023 when the death toll of UNRWA members reached 20.


## Final Judgement
The claim is false because the black band on the UNRWA logo was not added to mourn Yahya Sinwar, but to show solidarity with war victims. This is supported by multiple sources, including a DW fact-check. The black band was present before the alleged death of Yahya Sinwar. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The black band on the UNRWA logo, as seen in the provided image, was not added to mourn Yahya Sinwar. Fact-checks, such as the one from DW ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)), indicate the band was added to show solidarity with war victims and was present before the alleged death of Sinwar.
