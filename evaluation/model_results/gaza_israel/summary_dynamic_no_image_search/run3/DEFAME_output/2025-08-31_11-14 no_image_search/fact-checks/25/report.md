## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Keir Starmer has made several statements regarding the situation in Gaza. He has called for a ceasefire, urged restraint from Israel, and described the situation as "appalling and intolerable." However, the provided evidence does not mention Starmer stating that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
