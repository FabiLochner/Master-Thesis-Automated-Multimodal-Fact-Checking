Content: The CFI UK news article discusses the controversy surrounding UNRWA and its support for Hamas. Some have claimed that UNRWA's modified logo with a black stripe was linked to the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. However, UNRWA stated that the black stripe was added in October 2023 when the death toll of UNRWA members reached 20. The article was amended on October 22, 2024. <image:18>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The black band on the UNRWA logo, as seen in the provided image, was not added to mourn Yahya Sinwar. Fact-checks, such as the one from DW ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)), indicate the band was added to show solidarity with war victims and was present before the alleged death of Sinwar.

So, the overall veracity is: false
