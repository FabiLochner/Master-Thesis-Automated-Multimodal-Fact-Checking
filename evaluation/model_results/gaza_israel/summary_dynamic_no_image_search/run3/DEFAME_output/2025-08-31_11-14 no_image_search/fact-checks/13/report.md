## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that on October 1, 2024, Katyusha rockets were fired near Baghdad International Airport, targeting a military base hosting U.S. forces, amid rising tensions in the Middle East ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)). ReliefWeb mentions attacks on September 30, including attacks by militias on Israel and rockets fired at Baghdad Airport ([https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024)).

Wikipedia discusses the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, part of the Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict, which occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, Hezbollah fired 35 rockets into northern Israel and the Golan Heights ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon)). The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were attacks in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was ongoing at that time. The Reuters report mentions a rocket attack targeting a military base hosting U.S. forces near Baghdad International Airport on October 1, 2024. ReliefWeb also mentions attacks on September 30, 2024, including attacks by militias and rockets fired at Baghdad Airport. The Wikipedia article details the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, which occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024.

However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to a specific attack on a U.S. facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.


## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 11](media/13.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Nigeria': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Chile': 0.05, 'Ecuador': 0.03, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Taiwan': 0.03, 'Bangladesh': 0.02, 'Belgium': 0.02, 'Brazil': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The geolocation results do not support the claim that the image was taken in Baghdad. The most likely locations identified by the geolocation tool do not include Iraq.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that there were attacks in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was ongoing. However, the image's geolocation does not support the claim that it was taken in Baghdad. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were attacks in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and the Israel-Hezbollah conflict was ongoing, the image's geolocation does not indicate it was taken in Baghdad.
