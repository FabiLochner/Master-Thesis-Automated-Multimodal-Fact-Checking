Useful result: From [Source](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-quds-force-head-esmail-qaani-attends-generals-funeral-tehran): 
Content: The Middle East Eye article, published on October 15, 2024, reports that Esmail Qaani attended a funeral in Tehran. The article includes photos of Qaani in military uniform. The article also mentions that Qaani had not been seen in public since an Israeli air strike in Lebanon. The article discusses speculation about his whereabouts and reports that he was under guard and being questioned about security breaches. <image:k>

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab is authentic, the context surrounding it is uncertain. The evidence presents conflicting narratives, including the possibility of disguise due to fear of Israeli airstrikes and rumors of espionage, making it impossible to verify the claim's accuracy.

So, the overall veracity is: false
