* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:64>)
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israel support")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost in the conflict, as reported by [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). He has also shown support for Israel amid the deadly Hamas attacks, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/).

Marca.com, in an article published on October 11, 2023, discusses Johnson's views on the Israel-Palestine war, mentioning his Instagram post where he expressed his heartbreak and outrage at the events, condemning the actions of Hamas and the loss of innocent lives. The image of Johnson wearing the Israeli flag (<image:64>) is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the provided sources do not mention the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the image is authentic. This could include a statement from Dwayne Johnson or a reliable source confirming the image's origin.


## Actions
```
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israeli flag image authenticity")
```

The quote also says that the Israeli government and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “heartless criminals without a drop of humanity.” The same wording has been circulated on Russian-language [pages](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0SRBRLHpy3yUgpPSRqKTJB2yPeDom8hSAuiBumfx2B1Xexvszh93Ete8hJHQfRWx3l&id=100070217693211)

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)

The appearance of the fake quote may be directly connected to events that occurred at the end of July. The city had been considered a key hub for the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.

SummarizeResultPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:64>)
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israel support")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost in the conflict, as reported by [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). He has also shown support for Israel amid the deadly Hamas attacks, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/).

Marca.com, in an article published on October 11, 2023, discusses Johnson's views on the Israel-Palestine war, mentioning his Instagram post where he expressed his heartbreak and outrage at the events, condemning the actions of Hamas and the loss of innocent lives. The image of Johnson wearing the Israeli flag (<image:64>) is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the provided sources do not mention the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the image is authentic. This could include a statement from Dwayne Johnson or a reliable source confirming the image's origin.


## Actions
```
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israeli flag image authenticity")
```

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/reverse-image-search-for-fake-photos/): 
Content: "Even a basic Google search can uncover truths.

Search for “Lionel Messi with Israeli flag” and you’ll find stories from _USA Today_ and Reuters debunking the image along with reports from AFP Fact Check, which is a department within Agence France-Presse French news agency, and other fact-checking sites.

In the photograph, Lionel Messi holds an Israeli flag. Stars such as Ben Affleck, Chris Evans, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Sylvester Stallone have all appeared in T-shirts that make contentious political statements. Go to the source ﻿

A quick look at Messi’s Instagram page would have shown that he didn’t post the Israeli flag photo. Enter by 8/31.](https://www.aarp.org/membership/sweeps/getawaygiveawayswps25/?cmp=DPMCK22IXUKZV "Gateway Giveaway")

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost in the conflict, as reported by [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). He has also shown support for Israel amid the deadly Hamas attacks, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/).

Marca.com, in an article published on October 11, 2023, discusses Johnson's views on the Israel-Palestine war, mentioning his Instagram post where he expressed his heartbreak and outrage at the events, condemning the actions of Hamas and the loss of innocent lives. The image of Johnson wearing the Israeli flag (<image:64>) is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Elaboration

The Israeli government and its Prime Minister Netanyahu are heartless criminals with no shred of humanity," is rated as "Incorrect Attribution" by Snopes. The article states that there is no credible record of Johnson making such a statement. The original post of the quote was found on an X account named Global Lens News (@Global_Lens_New). <image:12380>, <image:12381>, <image:12382>.
