Useful result: From [Source](https://www.972mag.com/hezbollah-rockets-palestinians-iron-dome-shelters/): 
Content: The search result from 972mag.com discusses Hezbollah attacks on northern Israel, including incidents in Majd Al-Krum on October 16 and 25, 2024, and Ma'alot-Tarshiha on October 29, 2024. The article also mentions a protest against the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza on August 15, 2025, with a reference to Bezalel Smotrich. <image:k>

The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unproven. While the evidence confirms that there was an exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel on August 25, 2024, and that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister, there is no evidence to confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
