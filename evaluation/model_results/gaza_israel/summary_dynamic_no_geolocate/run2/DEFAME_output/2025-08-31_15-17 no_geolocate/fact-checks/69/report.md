## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli military forces were active in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, and the West Bank in February 2025. Specifically, there were reports of clashes and operations in Tasil in April 2025, and the IDF conducted operations in the West Bank, including Jenin and Tulkarm, during the same period. The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it mentions the presence of Israeli military forces in Tasil. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Israeli military entering Tasil in February 2025. Therefore, the claim is unverified.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israel military forces Tasil Daraa February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results include images of Israeli soldiers and military vehicles. One image is from Syria Direct (![image 7735](media/2025-08-29_22-02-1756504920-504432.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image search results do not provide any information to verify the claim. The search returned images of Israeli soldiers and military vehicles, but none of them match the image in the claim or provide any context about the location or date. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Israeli military forces were active in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, and the West Bank in February 2025. However, the image search did not return any results that match the image in the claim or provide any context about the location or date. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
