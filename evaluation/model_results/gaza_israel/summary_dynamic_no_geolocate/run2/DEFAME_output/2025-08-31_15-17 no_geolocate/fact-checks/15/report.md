## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In July 2024, electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "free Palestine" and "escalate now" (![image 13](media/15.jpg)). The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism and the Montreal police are investigating. A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the signs displayed "Globalize the intifada" and that Hampstead Mayor Levi demanded an apology from Montreal.

The Maple ([https://www.readthemaple.com/city-of-montreal-illegally-seized-pro-palestine-signs-activists-allege/](https://www.readthemaple.com/city-of-montreal-illegally-seized-pro-palestine-signs-activists-allege/)) discussed the removal of pro-Palestine signs by the City of Montreal.

The Montreal Gazette ([https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs)) reported on electronic roadwork billboards in Montreal displaying anti-Israel messages, including "Free Palestine" ![image 13](media/15.jpg), "Escalate Now," and "Globalize the Intifada." The mayor of Hampstead threatened legal action against Montreal's mayor, Valérie Plante, due to the messages. Montreal officials stated the signs were vandalized.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "Free Palestine" and "Escalate Now," in July 2024. The City of Montreal considered this an act of vandalism. The evidence also indicates that legal action was taken against Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante regarding the signs. However, the evidence does not state that the signs were authorized by Valérie Plante.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The image does show a traffic sign in Montreal displaying the message in July 2024. However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" and "Escalate Now" in July 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the City of Montreal considered the signs to be vandalism and does not support the claim that the signs were authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.

`false`
