Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/at-least-19-people-mostly-women-killed-in-latest-car-bomb-attack-in-syria): 
Content: PBS News reports on a car bomb explosion in Manbij, Syria, on February 3, 2025, which killed at least 19 people. <image:13262> The article, authored by Kareem Chehayeb, does not contain the image in the claim.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.columbian.com/news/2025/feb/03/at-least-19-killed-mostly-women-in-a-car-bomb-explosion-in-northern-syria/): 
Content: The Columbian reports on a car bomb explosion on the outskirts of Manbij, Syria, on August 31, 2025, which killed at least 19 people, mostly women. The article mentions the ongoing violence in the area, including clashes between Turkish-backed factions and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.

The claim '<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there were reports of Israeli airstrikes in Syria in February 2025, the image in question was not found in the search results, and there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts the destruction of army depots.

So, the overall veracity is: false
