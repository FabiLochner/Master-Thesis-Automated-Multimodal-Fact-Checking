## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/jd-vance-twitter-conservatives/): 
Content: The Nation published an article about J.D. Vance's Twitter activity. The article includes screenshots of Vance's tweets, including one from September 14, 2021, and another from July 25, 2021, where he criticizes Paul Krugman. ![image 13004](media/2025-08-31_15-31-1756654312-784253.jpg), ![image 13002](media/2025-08-31_15-31-1756654305-985433.jpg). The article also mentions Vance's deleted tweets. ![image 13001](media/2025-08-31_15-31-1756654304-826526.jpg). The article was written by Ginny Hogan.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that J.D. Vance has an X (formerly Twitter) profile with the username @JDVance1. The Nation published an article about J.D. Vance's Twitter activity, including screenshots of his tweets. However, the evidence does not contain any information about the content of Vance's profile, such as the "I stand with Israel" statement.

To verify the claim, I need to find a screenshot of J.D. Vance's X profile that says "I stand with Israel." The current evidence does not provide this.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/meet-theo-von-the-popular-podcaster-who-asked-jd-vance-about-israels-genocide-in-gaza/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/meet-theo-von-the-popular-podcaster-who-asked-jd-vance-about-israels-genocide-in-gaza/)) published an article about J.D. Vance's appearance on Theo Von's podcast, which includes a screenshot of Vance's X profile ![image 13015](media/2025-08-31_15-32-1756654355-713372.jpg). The JC ([https://www.thejc.com/news/usa/who-is-trumps-pick-for-vice-president-and-where-does-he-stand-on-israel-mro5hixv](https://www.thejc.com/news/usa/who-is-trumps-pick-for-vice-president-and-where-does-he-stand-on-israel-mro5hixv)) discusses J.D. Vance's stance on Israel, mentioning his strong support and including a photograph of Vance with Donald Trump ![image 13020](media/2025-08-31_15-32-1756654375-414805.jpg). "Wake Up To Politics" ([https://www.wakeuptopolitics.com/p/a-tweet-that-should-scare-israel](https://www.wakeuptopolitics.com/p/a-tweet-that-should-scare-israel)) discusses Vance's foreign policy stance on Israel, including a tweet from Vance ![image 13004](media/2025-08-31_15-31-1756654312-784253.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that J.D. Vance has an X profile and supports Israel. The Times of Israel and The JC mention Vance's stance on Israel. The "Wake Up To Politics" article also includes a tweet from Vance. However, none of the provided evidence includes a screenshot of Vance's X profile that says "I stand with Israel."

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim based on the provided evidence.
