### After the Boomtown Rats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: After the Boomtown Rats")\
\]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg/250px-Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)

Geldof performing as a solo artist in 1987

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, _Is That It?_,[\[5\]](#cite_note-GeldofBio-5)
 which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with [Dave Stewart](/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)")
 of [Eurythmics](/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")
) and "The Great Song of Indifference". In 1998, he [erroneously announced](/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries "List of premature obituaries")
 [Ian Dury](/wiki/Ian_Dury "Ian Dury")
's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)
 The event caused music paper _[NME](/wiki/NME "NME")
_ (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash")
) to call Geldof 'the world's worst DJ'.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg/250px-Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg)](/wiki/File:Breiti,_Campino,_Bob_Geldof.jpg)

Geldof performing with [Die Toten Hosen](/wiki/Die_Toten_Hosen "Die Toten Hosen")
 at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [Rostock](/wiki/Rostock,_Germany "Rostock, Germany")
, Germany on 7 June 2007

Along with [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [debt relief](/wiki/Debt_relief "Debt relief")
 for developing countries. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [Band Aid 30](/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)#Band_Aid_30 "Band Aid (band)")
, to record an updated version of the [charity single](/wiki/Charity_record "Charity record")
, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [Ebola virus](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease "Ebola virus disease")
 in West Africa.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

### Live Aid

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Live Aid")\
\]

Main article: [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid")

> "The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how Bob Geldof's leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam")
 money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)
 However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

### Commission for Africa

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Commission for Africa")\
\]

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

### DATA and One Campaign

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: DATA and One Campaign")\
\]

Bob Geldof worked closely with [DATA](/wiki/DATA "DATA")
 (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on '[I Don't Like Mondays](/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays "I Don't Like Mondays")
' for 30 years".[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 [Winston Peters](/wiki/Winston_Peters "Winston Peters")
, the [Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand) "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)")
 responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. He said the EU was "a mess" but warned Britain's young people had their futures "taken from them" as a result of the referendum.[\[104\]](#cite_note-104)

Ahead of the [2024 United Kingdom general election](/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election "2024 United Kingdom general election")
 Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)")
 candidate and [Minister of State for Development and Africa](/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Development_and_Africa "Minister of State for Development and Africa")
 [Andrew Mitchell](/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell "Andrew Mitchell")
.[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)

### Fathers' rights

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fathers' rights")\
\]

From January 2002 until sometime in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to [Father's Rights](/wiki/Father%27s_Rights "Father's Rights")
 campaigners; it was reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.[\[130\]](#cite_note-HandInquestReport-130)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-Hand-131)

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children.[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 He has since become an outspoken advocate of [fathers' rights](/wiki/Fathers%27_rights "Fathers' rights")
.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 After Yates' death from a heroin overdose in 2000,[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
 Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
 and later adopted her in 2007.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)
[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 As of 2019, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose.[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 Geldof stated the family was "beyond pain" after he confirmed the news of her death.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
[\[142\]](#cite_note-142)

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015.[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 They currently reside in [Battersea](/wiki/Battersea "Battersea")
, South London.[\[145\]](#cite_note-145)

Regarding his [Jewish](/wiki/Jew "Jew")
 ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based _[Jewish Telegraph](/wiki/Jewish_Telegraph "Jewish Telegraph")
_, Geldof said "I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won."[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)

According to [The Sunday Times Rich List](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_Rich_List "The Sunday Times Rich List")
, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)

Music legend Mary Coughlan has criticised the reaction of Live Aid founder [Bob Geldof](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bob-geldof)
 on Gaza.

The 1985 fundraising concert was famously conceived by Geldof after he was moved and angered by images of people starving to death in Ethiopia. I’d have no problem saying it to them if I met them.”

Claim: "In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army."

## Actions
```
web_search("U2 Bob Geldof tour Israeli army November 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia page for Bob Geldof mentions his work with U2's Bono for debt relief in developing countries and that in November 2014, Geldof announced a new Band Aid project. <image:k> The Dublin Live article, published on November 3, 2024, discusses Mary Coughlan criticizing Bono and Bob Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.

*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob\_Geldof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof)
*   [https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects.
2.  The Dublin Live article from November 2024 shows that Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.
3.  There is no evidence of a tour in November 2024 by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. The evidence suggests the opposite, with criticism of their silence on the situation in Gaza.

The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army."

## Actions
```
web_search("U2 Bob Geldof tour Israeli army November 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia page for Bob Geldof mentions his work with U2's Bono for debt relief in developing countries and that in November 2014, Geldof announced a new Band Aid project. <image:k> The Dublin Live article, published on November 3, 2024, discusses Mary Coughlan criticizing Bono and Bob Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.

## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects.
2.  The Dublin Live article from November 2024 shows that Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.
3.  There is no evidence of a tour in November 2024 by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. The evidence suggests the opposite, with criticism of their silence on the situation in Gaza.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified.

======================================

[Original Story](https://www.u2songs.com)
 by Aaron J. Sams (2025-06-30)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forty years ago U2 were one of the acts that played at Live Aid, a concert to raise money and awareness for the famine in Ethiopia, held in Philadelphia and London. U2 had planned to play three songs, but an unplanned foray into the audience by Bono left U2 with time for two only.

Bono was devastated thinking he had screwed up U2’s big chance. On that recording U2’s “Bad” is covered by the cast of the musical. It only runs 03:58, so it won’t be a complete recreation of U2’s performance that day."

The claim is not supported by the available evidence. While U2 has a tour in 2024, and Bob Geldof has collaborated with U2's Bono in the past, there is no evidence of a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. In fact, a Dublin Live article from November 2024, suggests criticism of Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza ([https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)).

Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s [address to Congress](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html)
 on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left.

An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris’ aide cited a previously scheduled event as the reason for missing the speech Wednesday.

A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden’s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister.

The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris’ first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and [endorsed Harris’ candidacy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination/index.html)
.

Harris is expected to “continue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,” the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas’ attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“We anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,” according to the aide.

U.S. “And they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.”

On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority’s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters.

“Her travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,” the aide said.

Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu’s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson.

Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu’s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN.

Netanyahu landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a [post by an Israeli Embassy official on X.](https://x.com/EliavBenjamin/status/1815484694902837408)
 He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza – including Americans – on Monday evening.

Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by his wife, are interviewed before the departure for Washington, Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel, July 22, 2024. — Amos ben Gershom/GPO

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to arrive to Washington on Monday and meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday, a day before the Israeli leader is due to address a joint session of Congress.

After Biden announced his intention to withdraw from the presidential race and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, Netanyahu refrained from wading into US electoral politics. The Israeli prime minister who is known to favor Republican nominees said Monday he will seek the continuation of American bipartisan [support of Israel](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/biden-approaches-red-line-netanyahu-7-months-gaza-war)
 and pledged to preserve Israel’s friendship and partnership with the United States no matter who wins the next election.

Speaking with reporters before taking off for Washington, Netanyahu said he intended to reaffirm to the United States — "to our friends in both political camps" — that "regardless of who the American people choose as their next president, Israel remains its most indispensable and strongest ally in the Middle East."

**Harris to the left of Biden**

Apart from Biden, and a possible, not-yet-confirmed meeting with former President Donald Trump, Netanyahu is also set to meet with Vice President and presidential front-runner Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

Harris is seen to the left of Biden on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reuters said Monday that Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policies, but could adopt a harsher tone with Israel over the Gaza war, if elected president.

Sidelining his disagreements with Biden, Netanyahu said that in addition to addressing Congress July 24, he is also set to meet with the American president "whom I have known for over 40 years." Netanyahu said, "This \[the meeting\] will be an opportunity to thank him for the things he did for Israel in the war and during his long and distinguished career in public service, as senator, vice president and president. In this time of war and uncertainty, it is of the outmost importance for our enemies to know that the United States and Israel are standing together — today, tomorrow and always."

Netanyahu’s visit to Washington will be his first since establishing his government in December 2022, and in fact the first in almost four years. Still, Schumer eventually joined the initiative of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite Netanyahu to address a joint session, making the Israeli premier one of the only world leaders to deliver his fourth speech to Congress.

The invitation letter for Netanyahu — signed by Johnson, Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — said, “To build on our enduring relationship and to highlight America’s solidarity with Israel, we invite you to share the Israeli government’s vision for defending democracy, \[combating\] terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.”

Washington police said they were expecting a large number of demonstrators outside Congress on Wednesday, protesting against Netanyahu and the [Gaza war](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/israels-netanyahu-gambles-gaza-cease-fire-new-conditions)
, and were making additional security arrangements. He said that this would mean that Netanyahu should expect a complicated meeting with the president, who will insist on reaching soon a plan for the liberation of the hostages and a Gaza cease-fire.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - The leader of the U.S. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who as president pro tempore normally would preside in the absence of Harris, said she was not attending Netanyahu's address.

"Securing a lasting, mutual ceasefire is of the utmost importance right now, and I will continue to push for one to be reached as soon as possible," Murray said in a statement.

She added that she hoped Netanyahu would use his speech to address how he plans to secure a ceasefire and lasting peace.

Murray is one of a few members of Congress who have said they will skip the address. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Netanyahu should not be welcomed into Congress and in a statement harshly criticized his "war machine."

Netanyahu's visit to Washington to address Congress was orchestrated by the legislature's Republican leaders, who have accused President Joe Biden, a Democrat, of showing insufficient support for Israel, despite the billions of dollars in U.S. 5 election, forged a close relationship with Netanyahu during his presidency.

Israel has been criticized internationally over its campaign in Gaza, which Gaza health authorities say has killed almost 39,000 Palestinians, as well as the expansion of settlement building in the occupied West Bank and Jewish settlers' attacks on Palestinians.

Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas after militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border assault on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies.

Biden's support for Israel during its offensive has drawn criticism domestically, especially among younger voters.

Hours earlier, Israel’s prime minister had enjoyed a more cordial [greeting from Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/25/netanyahu-and-biden-will-meet-to-discuss-a-ceasefire-in-gaza)
 in the Oval Office, saying: “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel.”

According to a White House [account](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/25/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel/)
 of their meeting, the two leaders discussed the ceasefire and hostage negotiations “in detail”, and Biden “expressed the need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza”.

Harris’ forceful remarks on Thursday, which were sharp and serious in tone, reflected what might mark a departure from Biden in how she deals with Netanyahu. She said Israel has “a right to defend itself and how it does so matters.”

Harris’s backers say that she is [more likely to engage in public criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/23/as-netanyahu-arrives-in-washington-kamala-harris-treads-a-careful-path-on-israel-and-gaza)
 of Netanyahu than Biden and to focus attention on the civilian toll among Palestinians from the war in Gaza – even if she would maintain US military aid and other support for Israel that has been a mainstay of Biden’s foreign policy.

White House officials say Israel and Hamas are “closer now than we’ve been before” to reaching a ceasefire deal, with a senior administration official saying a framework for the deal had been agreed upon but that “serious implementation issues … still had to be resolved. The two men have had a strained relationship since Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory in the 2020 election, which Trump has claimed without evidence was manipulated.

Kamala Harris says ‘I will not be silent’ on suffering in Gaza after Netanyahu talks

Democratic presidential contender strikes tough tone in public remarks following meeting with Israeli prime minister on US visit

*   [See all our Israel-Gaza war coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war)
    

Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pressed Israel’s [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 on the “dire” humanitarian situation in Gaza in talks that she described as frank, adding “I will not be silent.”

In comments that were closely watched for signs of a shift from Joe Biden’s policy approach, the US vice-president said after the meeting: “What has happened in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 over the past nine months is devastating. Some noted the significance of Harris being the one to give public remarks after both she and Biden had separately met the prime minister.

During the meeting, Harris brought up the repeated displacement of Palestinians since the start of the war, sparked by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 hostages were taken.

Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with US vice-president Kamala Harris in Washington, DC on Thursday. “It’s a kind of like: ‘How do we close these final gaps?’”

Netanyahu promised “total victory” in the Gaza war in a raucous speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying that there were “intensive” efforts to bring the hostages home but giving little detail about how that would be achieved.

Harris – the presiding officer of the Senate – did not attend Netanyahu’s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday but released a careful statement saying that her absence should not be interpreted as a boycott of the event.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.

Harris also recalled planting trees for Israel as a child and said that as a senator from California and as vice-president she has had an “unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel” and its people. “We discussed the opportunities and challenges in AI, its impact on the economy and society, and explored ways for technological cooperation with Israel,” Netanyahu said in a post on X.

Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet Trump on Friday at his residence in Mar-a-Lago."

The evidence indicates that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 26, 2024, and stated her "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)). While this statement aligns with the sentiment expressed in the claim, the exact quote "Our support for Israel will continue" is not found in the provided evidence.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Israel: A Record of Complicity, Not Change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

! <image:13167>

By: Melissa Garriga 

Vice President Kamala Harris has often been portrayed as a more sympathetic figure toward the plight of Palestinians, a leader who might offer a nuanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Harris has accepted over half a million dollars from the pro-Israel lobby, and her actions, along with those of President Biden, underscore the administration's unwavering support for Israel's ongoing occupation and brutal campaign in Palestine. When asked whether Israel meets international standards of human rights, Harris's response was a resounding "Overall, yes," a statement that starkly contrasts with the reality of Israel's human rights abuses.

The Vice President's stories of planting trees in Israel as a child are particularly tone-deaf. Harris has tried to strategically position herself as distinct from President Biden on Israel's genocide campaign in Gaza, calling for a ceasefire "for at least six weeks" in March 2024. The world is watching, and history will judge her accordingly.**_

_Melissa Garriga is the communications and media relations manager for CODEPINK. JDCA CEO Halie Soifer reminisced about Harris' 2017 trip to Israel, highlighting her "deep commitment to Israel's security and strong ties to the Jewish community." This trip, however, should not be romanticized—it was a clear signal of Harris's alignment with the pro-Israel lobby, a relationship that has only deepened over the years.

Harris's recent actions further illustrate her troubling stance. This selective outrage is not only hypocritical but also reveals a disturbing willingness to ignore atrocities committed by Israel while amplifying unsubstantiated claims against its Palestinians.

The [Jewish Current's 2020 article on Harris's ties to the AIPAC lobby group](https://jewishcurrents.org/restoring-the-bipartisan-consensus)
 paints an even clearer picture. Even when grassroots pressure mounted for Democratic candidates to distance themselves from AIPAC in 2019, Harris quietly met with AIPAC leaders, reaffirming her commitment to a strong U.S.-Israel alliance and combating anti-Semitism."

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:1606>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep. Pingback: [James Baldwin on Black-Jewish Relations, Israel and the United States – Tony Greenstein demo](https://demo.tonygreenstein.com/james-baldwin-on-black-jewish-relations-israel-and-the-united-states/)
    
8. 

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Content: "(Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)

Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations of targeting civilians, saying it abides by international law and has a right to defend itself after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.

Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Some 83% of Gaza’s population are residing in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone,” according to IDF assessments in July.

The zone is located in the al-Mawasi area on the southern Strip’s coast, western neighborhoods of Khan Younis, and central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. Israel says it has killed some 18,000 combatants in battle as of November, 2024, and another 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.

According to the PCBS, the population of Gaza has declined by about 160,000 during the course of the war to 2.1 million, with more than a million or 47% of the total under the age of 18. The data presented by the body this week claimed that there were approximately 60,000 pregnant women currently in the Strip, which would mean an increase in births despite the overall decline in population and ongoing grueling war.

The PCBS said some 22% of Gaza’s population currently faces catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, according to the criteria of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global monitor.

Included in that 22% are some 3,500 children at risk of death due to malnutrition and lack of food, the bureau said.

It added that Israel has “raged a brutal aggression against Gaza targeting all kinds of life there; humans, buildings and vital infrastructure… entire families were erased from the civil register. (Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)

The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Around 45,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, have been killed since the war began and another 11,000 are missing, the bureau said, citing numbers from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

The Hamas figures cannot be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and fighters. <image:1646>

This picture shows tents at a makeshift camp for displaced Palestinians, during a storm in Gaza City on December 31, 2024, . The numbers appear to assume that all of those considered missing amid the mass displacement inside the Strip are actually dead.

Etymology
---------

This section is an excerpt from [Gaza City § Etymology](/wiki/Gaza_City#Etymology "Gaza City")
.\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaza_City&action=edit)\
\]

The name _Gaza_ first appears in military records of [Tuthmosis III](/wiki/Tuthmosis_III "Tuthmosis III")
 of [Egypt](/wiki/New_Kingdom_(Egypt) "New Kingdom (Egypt)")
 in the 15th century BC,[\[34\]](#cite_note-38)
 and was mentioned in the [Amarna correspondence](/wiki/Amarna_correspondence "Amarna correspondence")
 as _Āl Ĥazzati_ and other variant spellings.[\[35\]](#cite_note-39)
 In [Neo-Assyrian](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian")
 sources, reflecting the late [Philistine](/wiki/Philistine "Philistine")
 period, it was known as _Hāzat_.[\[36\]](#cite_note-40)
 It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.

Based on the city's [modern Hebrew](/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew")
 name, _ʻAzzā_, a common [folk etymology](/wiki/Folk_etymology "Folk etymology")
 insists the name stems from the Hebrew root _[ʻayin](/wiki/%CA%BBayin "ʻayin")
_\-_[zayin](/wiki/Zayin "Zayin")
_\-_zayin_, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived,[\[37\]](#cite_note-Gaza_City_Masalha-41)
 but this is unlikely. ([Discuss](/wiki/Talk:Gaza_Strip#Split_section_History "Talk:Gaza Strip")<br>) _(February 2025)_ |

Historically part of the [Palestine region](/wiki/Palestine_region "Palestine region")
, the area was controlled since the 16th century by the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire")
; in 1906, the Ottomans and the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire")
 set [the region's international border](/wiki/Egypt%E2%80%93Gaza_border "Egypt–Gaza border")
 with [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")
.[\[39\]](#cite_note-:4-43)
 With the defeat of the [Central Powers](/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers")
 in [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 and the subsequent [partition of the Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Partition of the Ottoman Empire")
, the British deferred the governance of the Gaza Strip area to Egypt, which declined the responsibility.[\[40\]](#cite_note-44)
 Britain itself kept and ruled the territory it occupied in 1917–18, from 1920 until 1948 under the internationally accepted frame of "[Mandatory Palestine](/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine")

 [fled or were expelled](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight")
 to the Gaza Strip.[\[41\]](#cite_note-Reuters-45)

Between 1973 (after the [Yom Kippur War](/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War "Yom Kippur War")

Gaza City in 1967

According to [Tom Segev](/wiki/Tom_Segev "Tom Segev")
, moving the Palestinians out of the country had been a persistent element of Zionist thinking from early times.[\[64\]](#cite_note-TSegev-68)
 In December 1967, during a meeting at which the [Security Cabinet](/wiki/Security_Cabinet_of_Israel "Security Cabinet of Israel")
 [brainstormed](/wiki/Brainstorming "Brainstorming")
 about what to do with the Arab population of the newly occupied territories, one of the suggestions Prime Minister [Levi Eshkol](/wiki/Levi_Eshkol "Levi Eshkol")
 proffered regarding Gaza was that the people might leave if Israel restricted their access to water supplies.[\[65\]](#cite_note-69)
 A number of measures, including financial incentives, were taken shortly afterwards to begin to encourage Gazans to emigrate elsewhere.[\[64\]](#cite_note-TSegev-68)

 Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, "various international agencies struggled to respond" and [American Near East Refugee Aid](/wiki/American_Near_East_Refugee_Aid "American Near East Refugee Aid")

Israeli soldiers in Gaza in 1969

Subsequent to this military victory, Israel created the first [Israeli settlement](/wiki/Israeli_settlement "Israeli settlement")
 bloc in the Strip, [Gush Katif](/wiki/Gush_Katif "Gush Katif")
, in the southwest corner near [Rafah](/wiki/Rafah "Rafah")
 and the Egyptian border on a spot where a [small kibbutz](/wiki/Kfar_Darom "Kfar Darom")
 had previously existed for 18 months between 1946 and 1948. The commission deemed the rest of the cases illegal, and concluded with a recommendation calling on Israel to examine whether [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
 or [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
 had been committed, and if so, to bring those responsible to trial.[\[147\]](#cite_note-151)
[\[148\]](#cite_note-152)

On 28 February 2019, the Commission said it had "'reasonable grounds' to believe Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes and shot at journalists, health workers and children during protests in Gaza in 2018." Israel refused to take part in the inquiry and rejected the report.[\[149\]](#cite_note-CNN1111-153)

### 2021: Israel–Palestine crisis

Before the [2021 Israel–Palestine crisis](/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis "2021 Israel–Palestine crisis")
, Gaza had 48% unemployment and half of the population lived in poverty."

Gaza Strip - Statistics & Facts
===============================

The Gaza Strip is a Palestinian territory of about 365 square kilometers and 2.1 million inhabitants, making it one of the world’s most densely populated regions. 
  
From 2008 onwards, in response to rocket attacks from Palestinian militants, Israel began its blockade of Gaza, causing the movements of [goods](/statistics/1423093/gaza-average-monthly-volume-of-incoming-goods/)
 and [people](/statistics/1423074/gaza-number-of-monthly-average-exits-to-or-via-israel/)
 from and into the Gaza Strip to be very restricted ever since. 
  

The population of Gaza
----------------------

The Gaza Strip has quite a young population, with most inhabitants under 15 years old. While declining over the years, the [fertility rate in Gaza](/statistics/1423019/gaza-fertility-rate/)
 is still relatively high. [The life expectancy of Gazans](/statistics/1423008/gaza-life-expectancy-at-birth-by-gender/)
 was estimated at 72.97 years for men and 76.81 years for women. 
  

The Israel-Hamas war 2023
-------------------------

Before October 2023, there had been [four wars between Israel and Hamas](/statistics/1422874/palestinian-territories-duration-of-israeli-military-actions-in-the-gaza-strip/)
. [The electricity supply](/statistics/1422942/gaza-supply-of-electricity-by-provider/)
, which Israel mainly controls, was already limited throughout the day, and Israel and Egypt controlled the import of goods into Gaza. Since November 19, an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza – over 82 percent of the region’s total population – have become internally displaced refugees."

According to a January 1, 2025, CNN article, Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving since October 7, 2023. The article also mentions that at least 45,553 were killed in Israeli attacks. The Times of Israel reports a 6% decline in Gaza's population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), which indicates a decline of approximately 160,000 people. The article also mentions that around 45,500 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

Conversely, a December 19, 2024, article by the New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA) states that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA), supports the claim, stating a 2.02% increase based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, other sources, including CNN and The Times of Israel, report a 6% *decrease* in population since the war began. These sources cite factors such as people leaving Gaza and casualties.

The Wikipedia and Statista articles provide population estimates but do not explicitly state the percentage change since October 7, 2023. World Population Review estimates a 2.84% annual growth, but this is not specifically tied to the period since October 7, 2023.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the conflicting information.

CNN  — 

Former President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45)
 met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.

The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, [conveyed a forcefulness](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.

Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, [Harris’ office rejected on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html)
 the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the [vice president’s remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 could have made [a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 harder to reach.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/harris-i-wont-stay-silent-on-gaza-suffering-israel-charges-shes-harming-deal-chances/)
.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”

Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”

Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.

During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

“Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.

In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.

“At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has the details.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/video-blanche-maxwell-split-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

Harris, Trump condemn pro-Hamas protest near US Capitol

Print

The two leading U.S. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024.

In her statement, Harris concluded, "I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation."

In the first days of her presidential campaign against Republican Trump, Harris held a campaign rally with a teachers' union in the southwestern state of Texas on Thursday before flying to Washington to meet with Netanyahu at the White House. You had a horrible invasion that took place that would have never happened if I was president."

After Wednesday's protests, Trump called for Israel to quickly end the war and said the country was "not good" at promoting its cause in world affairs.

"You got to get it done quickly," Trump told Fox News.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on Thursday condemned the most visible of the pro-Hamas protests against Israel that erupted the day before near the U.S. flag.

On his Truth Social media platform, Trump said "If those people rioting in Washington yesterday were Republicans/Conservatives, they'd all be in jail right now, facing 10- to 20-year sentences. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024. Capitol.

The protests came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was defiantly defending his country's war against the Hamas militants in an address to Congress.

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, said in a statement, "We saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric" at Union Station, Washington's train depot not far from the Capitol.

In the plaza in front of the rail station, demonstrators replaced American flags with Palestinian flags, and a man climbed up to the middle of a fountain and used red spray paint to write "Hamas is comin'" in big letters. officials, condemned the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.

But as the months of fighting have raged on, and Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza targeting Hamas fighters killed more Palestinian civilians, especially thousands of women and children, Harris became more outspoken, initially blunter than Biden, about the need to end the conflict.

In March, she called for an "immediate" pause in fighting, contending that Israel had not done enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" among Palestinians in Gaza.

"People in Gaza are starving," she said. That's who Kamala Harris is."

Trump, after remaining mostly silent about the Israel-Hamas war, in March told Israel it has "to finish the problem."

In Capitol address, Israeli leader calls for U.S. Capitol on July 24, 2024 in Washington, D.C. Capitol on July 24, 2024 in Washington, D.C. “Ladies and gentlemen, that victory is in sight.”

The Israeli leader visited Washington as his military’s airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis added dozens of deaths to a mounting toll of 39,000, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

Additionally, [news](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-declares-two-more-gaza-hostages-dead-2024-07-22/)

Harris’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Both Biden and Harris are expected to meet Netanyahu separately on Thursday, followed by a joint meeting with the families of American hostages still held by Hamas.

“The leaders will discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region,” according to a statement released Wednesday by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Harris’s absence in a statement, calling it “disgraceful snub” and accusing the vice president of being “weak” on Israel.

The Senate’s president pro tempore, Patty Murray of Washington, also did not preside, citing opposition to the war in a statement [reported](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/jul/23/patty-murray-will-skip-israeli-prime-ministers-add/)

Trump’s post comes after Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said that there are no major changes being made to the [Republican National Convention](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/rnc-milwaukee-trump-full-list-speakers/index.html)

![President Joe Biden delivers remarks alongside Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House on Sunday, July 14. He later told CNN that he is not aware of Trump’s “specific schedule” for the week.

Though Trump has “obviously been through a lot in the last 24 hours,” Schimming said, based on his understanding, Trump is “doing well” and his thoughts are focused on the victims of the shooting.

In the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, Schimming said he remains “very, very confident” in the security preparations around the convention.

He said he’s not anticipating any “major changes” to the existing security plan, adding that “if they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now.”

A local police officer saw the gunman just before he fired on a Donald Trump rally Saturday but was unable to engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Nathan Howard/Reuters

President Joe Biden urged people not to make assumptions and to “let the FBI do their job” in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

Biden, who spoke from the White House on Sunday, stood with Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas.

He stressed that we “don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter,” but that we “know who he is.”

He said he had instructed the investigation, which he said is in its early stages, to be “thorough and swift” and said the “investigators will have every resource they need to get this done.”

US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threatened those holding hostages in the Middle East with unprecedented American firepower if they are not released by the time he enters office on January 20.

Trump first made a similar [threat](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-those-holding-us-hostages-will-pay-a-very-big-price-if-theyre-not-freed/)
 as a presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention in July, but the latest warning posted on Truth Social came two days after Hamas [released](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-hamas-propaganda-video-hostage-edan-alexander-pleads-with-trump-to-push-for-deal/)
 a propaganda video showing American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander pleading with the president-elect to secure his release.

The statement also came hours after the IDF revealed that another American-Israeli hostage — Omer Neutra — was killed during Hamas’s October 7 onslaught and that his body is being held in Gaza. Neutra had been thought to be alive, in captivity.

“Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East – But it’s all talk and no action!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, without mentioning Israel or the Palestinian terror group by name.

“Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,” he continued.

 Already a member? RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!” Trump added.

He called for the hostages’ release several times throughout his presidential campaign, but also made a point of insisting that most of the hostages are no longer alive.

Accordingly, he was [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/trump-said-surprised-when-herzog-told-him-half-of-hostages-still-alive/)
 caught off guard when President Isaac Herzog told him in a call late last month that Israeli intelligence assesses that half of the hostages still in Gaza are alive.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife Sara [said](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-dines-with-visiting-sara-netanyahu-at-his-florida-golf-resort/)
 she raised the plight of the hostages during her dinner on Sunday night with Trump at the president-elect’s golf resort in Florida.

The outgoing administration is still working to secure a deal before January 20 and US President Joe Biden met with the families of the remaining American hostages last month in the Oval Office.

“I don’t care if Trump gets all the credit as long as they come back home,” Biden told the families during the meeting, according to one of the family members in the room.

After securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah last week, Biden said he would [launch](https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-hezbollah-truce-takes-effect-us-confirms-new-push-for-gaza-deal/)
 another effort to secure a similar deal in Gaza, by leaning on Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt, which all have ties with Hamas, in order to coax the terror group into a deal.

The topic was slated to be discussed when a Hamas delegation held [meetings](https://www.timesofisrael.com/cairo-hosts-fatah-hamas-talks-aiming-for-deal-on-pa-control-in-post-war-gaza/)

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon this week during [escalated fighting](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd)

U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon this week during escalated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah

Oct. 7, triggering [the war in Gaza](https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war)
.

Other countries, from Greece to the United Kingdom, Japan and Colombia, have arranged flights or sent military planes to ferry out their citizens.

As Israeli bombardments targeting senior Hezbollah leaders shook southern neighborhoods in Lebanon's capital last week, “We could still see, hear and feel everything” despite fleeing to the mountains outside Beirut, said Nicolette Hutcherson, a longtime humanitarian volunteer living in Lebanon with her husband and three children.

The only seats Hutcherson's family could find on commercial carriers were for flights weeks away and for thousands of dollars, she said. Family members said he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

“He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,” she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising them to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said relatives who are U.S. Limits on withdrawing money from banks due to [Lebanon’s longstanding economic collapse](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-war-economy-d5433642fcfce79facf8a1369b14d0f0)
 and intermittent electricity and internet have made it difficult, they said.

Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a lawyer based in Washington, paid $5,000 to get a female relative on the last seat of a flight out of Beirut on Saturday.

“She was on her way to the airport” when Israeli began one of its first days of intensified bombing, Abou-Chedid said.

By Thursday, some Americans said their loved ones had been able to secure tickets for upcoming flights and were hopeful.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon’s flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

Miller said the embassy is prepared to offer temporary loans to Americans who choose to remain in Lebanon but want to relocate to a potentially safer area of the country. Iran on Tuesday [fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da)
 toward Israel, leaving the region bracing for any Israeli retaliation and fearing an all-out regional war.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, attacked Israel on Oct."

WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will begin offering charter flights to Europe to help Americans leave Israel if they want starting Friday, the White House said, after extensive talks with U.S. airlines and pressure from Congress.

The U.S. government will provide charter flights to cities in Europe, White House spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. It is unclear how long the offer will last but it might just a few days, airline officials said.

" If you choose to take this departure assistance, transportation will be by air to Athens or Frankfurt, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus," it added.

Senate Majority Chuck Schumer praised the announcement but said "these transports must be increased as needed to ensure Americans in Israel who want to can return to the United States."

Newsweek AI is in beta. State Department has begun "assisted departure flights" for U.S. embassy in Israel directed _Newsweek_ to the State Department's media inquiry form.

**Why It Matters**
------------------

Over the past few days, the conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated dramatically, with Trump calling for the evacuation of Tehran, Iran's capital city home to over 9.5 million people.

Israel initially struck Tehran and several other cities in "Operation Rising Lion," a campaign it said was meant to preempt a planned Iranian attack and disrupt Iran's nuclear capabilities.

Iran, which has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, has since retaliated, though Israeli defense systems—bolstered by [U.S. military](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/u.s.-military)
 technology—have intercepted about 99 percent of incoming missile fire, according to Israeli officials on Saturday morning in an X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter)
, post. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump is expected to make a decision about whether to directly support Israel in its attacks against Iran within the next two weeks.

**What To Know**
----------------

The State Department on Saturday issued a notice with information for U.S. citizens and lawful residents in Iran and Israel on how to leave the countries.

It said, "The Department of State has begun assisted departure flights from Israel," but did not provide further details, including the number or origin of the flights. The State Department has not responded to _Newsweek's_ request for comment as of Saturday afternoon.

The government hasn't offered such flights since the beginning of the war between [Hamas](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/hamas)
 and Israel that started on October 7, 2023.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict, which aligns with the claim. The U.S. is also assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights, with the expectation that the flights will be repaid.

The evidence supports the claim that the U.S. government is providing assistance for departures from both Lebanon and Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the U.S. is assisting *U.S. citizens* in leaving Israel, and that these flights are to be repaid.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion about flying Israeli citizens is not. More information is needed to verify the claim about flying Israeli citizens.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. State Department is offering assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens from Israel, including charter flights to Europe, with options to Athens or Frankfurt by air, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus. Americans will be asked to repay the U.S. government for these flights. The State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory. (<image:9577>, <image:9595>, <image:9596>)

Newsweek mentions "Operation Exodus" and notes that the embassy in Jerusalem is assisting with departures via cruise ship, commercial or charter flights, or U.S. government-operated flights. These actions are in response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict, which aligns with the claim. The U.S. is also assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights, with the expectation that the flights will be repaid.

The evidence supports the claim that the U.S. government is providing assistance for departures from both Lebanon and Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the U.S. is assisting *U.S. citizens* in leaving Israel, and that these flights are to be repaid.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion about flying Israeli citizens is not. More information is needed to verify the claim about flying Israeli citizens.

The evidence confirms that the U.S. government arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel starting in October 2023, due to the conflict. The claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. State Department is offering assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens from Israel, including charter flights to Europe, with options to Athens or Frankfurt by air, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus. Americans will be asked to repay the U.S. government for these flights. The State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory. (<image:9577>, <image:9595>, <image:9596>)

Newsweek mentions "Operation Exodus" and notes that the embassy in Jerusalem is assisting with departures via cruise ship, commercial or charter flights, or U.S. government-operated flights. These actions are in response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict, which aligns with the claim. The U.S. is also assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights, with the expectation that the flights will be repaid.

The evidence supports the claim that the U.S. government is providing assistance for departures from both Lebanon and Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the U.S. is assisting *U.S. citizens* in leaving Israel, and that these flights are to be repaid.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion about flying Israeli citizens is not. More information is needed to verify the claim about flying Israeli citizens.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. government arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel starting in October 2023, due to the conflict. The claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.

Israeli strikes on Gaza kill at least 100, including many sheltering at school, Palestinian health officials say
================================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Apr 3, 2025 10:18 AM EDT

DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes killed at least 100 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including at least 27 sheltering at a school in the north, according to Palestinian medical authorities, in a stepped-up offensive that Israel’s military said is intended to put new pressure on Hamas and eventually expel the militant group.

The bodies of 14 children and five women were recovered from the school in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, and the death toll could still rise because some of the 70 wounded had critical injuries, said Health Ministry spokesman Zaher al-Wahidi. More than 30 other Gaza residents were killed in strikes on homes in a nearby neighborhood of Shijaiyah, he said, citing records at Ahli Hospital.

The Israeli military on Thursday ordered more residents in parts of northern Gaza to move to shelters in the western side of Gaza City, warning that it planned to “work with extreme force in your area.” A number of the Palestinians leaving the targeted area did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts.

“My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,” said Mohammad Ermana, 72. “I’m searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,” he said.

Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected ground operations, which the U.N. Israel has imposed a month-long halt on all imports of food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle.

Another deadly day in Gaza
--------------------------

Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.

Officials in Khan Younis, in the southern part of the strip, said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital – nine of them from the same family. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.

The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in Gaza. Rights groups say such investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Israel was establishing a new security corridor across Gaza to pressure Hamas, suggesting it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel has ordered evacuated, from the rest of the Palestinian territory.

Israel has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor, which separates the northern third of Gaza from the rest of the narrow strip. Both that and another corridor, along Gaza’s southern perimeter, run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are believed to be alive — in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.

Netanyahu visits Hungary
------------------------

Netanyahu arrived in Hungary early Thursday on his second foreign trip since the world’s top war crimes court issued an arrest warrant against him in November over Israel’s war in Gaza.

Based in The Hague, Netherlands, the the International Criminal Court has said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant used “starvation as a method of warfare” by restricting humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas — charges that Israeli officials deny.

ICC member countries, such as Hungary, are required to arrest suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that and relies on states to comply. As Netanyahu arrived in Budapest, Hungary said it will begin the procedure of withdrawing from the ICC.

Plans for Gaza
--------------

On Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel plans to maintain overall security control of Gaza after the war and implement U.S. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.

Israel’s offensive has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say whether those killed are civilians or combatants."

Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike on a school turned shelter in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. In a statement, the Israeli military said it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties in the bombing of what it described as a control centre for the militant group [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas)
.

Another 20 people were killed in a dawn airstrike on the Shuja’iya suburb of [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 City, bringing the total number of casualties reported by the local health ministry to 97 in the past 24 hours.

The intense wave of Israeli bombing comes amid a major expansion of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) aerial and ground operations in the besieged Palestinian territory following Israel’s decision to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire two weeks ago.

The Israeli military said on Thursday it had struck more than 600 “terror targets” across the strip since resuming large-scale airstrikes on 18 March. | Sanam Vakil\

The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 50,357 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.

Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to restart ceasefire talks have so far failed.

At least 27 killed in Israeli bombing of shelter in Gaza City, rescuers say
===========================================================================

This article is more than 4 months old

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flee from southern city of Rafah in one of war’s biggest mass displacements

An Israeli bombing of a school turned shelter in Gaza City has killed at least 27 people, rescuers said, and hundreds of thousands in the Rafah area are fleeing in one of the biggest mass displacements of the war amid Israel’s newly announced campaign to “divide up” the Gaza Strip.

Three missiles hit Dar al-Arqam school in al-Tuffah neighbourhood on Thursday afternoon, the civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal said, killing several children and wounding 100 people.

The building was being used as a shelter for Palestinians displaced from their homes. Gaza’s health ministry, which the UN relies on for casualty data, says 1,163 people have been killed in bombings since the ceasefire collapsed.

The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza in April 2025, as stated in the claim. However, the evidence does not mention Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's specific details about the baby.

Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel  on Saturday morning, October 7 in a surprise assault as several gunmen crossed into different Israeli towns while a heavy barrage of rockets are fired from the Gaza Strip.

As at press time, warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem.

At least 40 people have been killed since Hamas launched the surprise attack on Israel, the country’s emergency service said.

Another 779 people have been wounded, according to the Israeli Health Ministry.

  
Israel’s military said it was on a war footing and the defense minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a “grave mistake” by declaring war on Israel, in retaliation, Israeli military launched air strikes into Gaza.

  
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said Hamas had “launched a war against the State of Israel”. Israeli “troops are fighting against the enemy at every location”, he said.

The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.

> “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel’s police chief said there were “21 active scenes” in southern Israel.

  
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of war ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

  
Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from a Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said militants had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.

>   
> “They just came in again, please send help,” she said. “There are a lot of homes harmed … My husband is holding the door closed … They are firing rounds of bullets.”

Palestinian media reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.

  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in  a speech this morning said the country was in war. His office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours.

  
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.

  
“We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,” said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.

  
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

| I want to believe no terrorist will moan when the mighty hand of Israel hit them hard. I've always said it, these religious lot are nothing but a bunch of barbarians. Give 'em an inch and they'll sink your country like the Titanic. Just look at what's been going on up north in Nigeria. The whole point of their religion seems to be causing trouble and chaos, so it's no surprise that their followers are just as bad.  <br>  <br>They're a bunch of hypocrites, aren't they? They blow things up, run and hide, then come out crying when the Israelis strike back. They use civilians as human shields, the bloody cowards! It's like they have no shame. All they know how to do is make trouble, then play the victim when things go south. They're a bunch of chancers, the lot of them. Bloody cowards!  <br>  <br>I 'ope these ruddy terrorists know that the Israelis don't muck about when it comes to lookin' out for their own. If any of their Yank cousins got caught up in it, it'd be a right proper problem for them. I think they've forgotten about what happened in Munich, and the consequences after that. This could be right nasty, if you get my drift.

| They always start the attack smiling and end in tears. It's no longer new, as we're getting used to it. Just that their Islamic international community will be shouting "unfair & injustice" by the time Israel responds by defending themselves. Now they will not talk to their people or condemn this "surprised" attack but they will be all out campaigning against and condemning Israel for defending themselves.  <br>  <br>The major problems we have on earth are:  <br>1\. Diseases  <br>2\. Islam  <br>3\. Natural disasters  <br>4\. Corruption  <br>5\.

    **আল-কাসসামের সফল অপারেশন: খান ইউনিসে ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের দুটি ট্যাংক ধ্বংস**
    
    ! <image:4221>
    
      
      
      
      
    ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা ও অত্যাচারের বিরুদ্ধে ফিলিস্তিনি মুজাহিদদের সংগ্রাম অব্যাহত রয়েছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস তাদের সর্বশেষ অপারেশনে ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক ধ্বংস করেছে। খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় সংঘটিত এই অপারেশনে ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও সাইড আইইডি ব্যবহার করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীদের উপর কঠোর প্রতিশোধ নেওয়া হয়েছে।  
      
    আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবার এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে যে তাদের যোদ্ধারা কেন্দ্রীয় খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক লক্ষ্য করে দুটি ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও একটি সাইড আইইডি’র বিস্ফোরণ ঘটিয়ে সেগুলো সফলভাবে ধ্বংস করেছে। এই অপারেশনটি গাজা উপত্যকায় ইসরায়েলের অব্যাহত গণহত্যা, ধ্বংসযজ্ঞ ও মানবতাবিরোধী অপরাধের জবাব হিসেবে পরিচালিত হয়েছে।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনী ২০২৩ সাল থেকে গাজায় নৃশংস হামলা চালাচ্ছে। আন্তর্জাতিক আদালতের রায় উপেক্ষা করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীরা গাজায় অবরোধ দিয়ে, খাদ্য ও ওষুধের সংকট সৃষ্টি করে মানবিক বিপর্যয় ডেকে এনেছে। এমনকি বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা (WHO) ও জাতিসংঘ বারবার সতর্ক করেও ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা বন্ধ করতে পারেনি।  
      
    এই পরিস্থিতিতে আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের মতো ফিলিস্তিনি প্রতিরোধ গ্রুপগুলোর অপারেশন ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের জন্য ক্রমাগত চ্যালেঞ্জ হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে। গত জুলাই মাসেও আল-কাসসাম ও আল-কুদস ব্রিগেডস যৌথভাবে ইসরায়েলি সেনাদের ওপর মর্টার হামলা চালিয়ে যানবাহন ধ্বংস করেছিল।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর নৃশংসতা যতই বাড়ছে, ফিলিস্তিনি জনগণের প্রতিরোধের চেতনা ততই শাণিত হচ্ছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবারের সফল অপারেশন প্রমাণ করে যে, অন্যায়ের বিরুদ্ধে সংগ্রাম কখনই থামানো যায় না। ইসরায়েলের অভ্যন্তরে বেড়ে চলেছে হতাশা নেতৃত্বহীনতার অভিযোগ। যুদ্ধের সময় যত গড়াচ্ছে, ততই স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠছে—যারা একদিন দখল নিতে এসেছিল, তারা আজ নিজেরাই দিশেহারা।

    **কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে যুগান্তকারী বাণিজ্য সহযোগিতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া**
    
    ! <image:4223>
    
      
      
    দ্বিপক্ষীয় অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক জোরদার করতে কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে একটি ব্যাপক অর্থনৈতিক পদক্ষেপ হাতে নিয়েছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তান। এই উদ্দেশ্যে একটি বিস্তারিত রোডম্যাপ প্রণয়ন ও সমঝোতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে উভয় পক্ষ। সম্প্রতি ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শিল্প ও বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রী নূরুদ্দিন আজিজি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ’র কিরগিজস্তান সফরকালে এই চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এই সময় বাণিজ্য সম্পর্ক সম্প্রসারণ ও ব্যবসায় বাধা অপসারণ করতে কিরগিজ প্রতিনিধিদের সাথে ব্যাপক আলোচনা উপস্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এছাড়া যৌথ বাণিজ্য কাউন্সিল গঠন, নিয়মিত বৈঠক আয়োজন এবং অগ্রগতি পর্যবেক্ষণের জন্য একটি যৌথ ওয়ার্কিং গ্রুপ গঠনের বিষয়ে উক্ত সভায় আলোচনা হয়েছে।  
      
    ট্রেড হাউস ও বাণিজ্যিক কেন্দ্র চালু করা, অর্থনৈতিক ফোরাম, প্রদর্শনী এবং আফগানিস্তানে যৌথ বিনিয়োগ সম্প্রসারণের পরিকল্পনা উত্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    দ্বিপাক্ষিক ট্রানজিট করিডোর, বাণিজ্য ও ট্রানজিট উন্নয়ন চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর এবং উজবেকিস্তান ও তাজিকিস্তানকে জড়িত করে ত্রিপক্ষীয় সহযোগিতায় কাজ করতে উভয়ে সম্মত হয়েছে।  
      
    নতুন এই চুক্তিতে কিরগিজ প্রশাসনের পক্ষ থেকে আফগান ব্যবসায়ীদের বাণিজ্যিক ভিসা, ব্যাংকিং সংযোগ ও পরিবহন রুট সহজতর করার প্রতিশ্রুতি রয়েছে।  
      
    আফগানিস্তান দক্ষিণ এশিয়া, মধ্য এশিয়া এবং মধ্য প্রাচ্যকে সংযোগকারী ট্রানজিট হাব হয়ে উঠার প্রবল সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে। তাই কৌশলগত অবস্থানকে কাজে লাগিয়ে মধ্য এশিয়ার রাষ্ট্রগুলোতে বাণিজ্য সম্প্রসারণ করছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া।  
      
    উক্ত সমঝোতা স্মারক দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কের ক্ষেত্রে একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য মাইলফলক হিসেবে অভিহিত করেছেন উভয় পক্ষ। এর মাধ্যমে উভয় দেশের মধ্যে ব্যবসা বৃদ্ধি ও অর্থনৈতিক সংহতির পথ প্রশস্ত হবে বলে প্রত্যাশা করা হচ্ছে।

    **আমেরিকার প্রচারিত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে রাজনৈতিক সুর বিদ্যমান: জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ**
    
    ! <image:4228>
    
      
      
    ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তানে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সরাসরি উপস্থিতি নেই, তারা আফগানিস্তান সম্পর্কে প্রত্যক্ষ জ্ঞানও রাখে না, তা সত্ত্বেও মানবাধিকার ইস্যুতে নিজেদের ইচ্ছে মতো মূল্যায়ন প্রকাশ করে যাচ্ছে ওয়াশিংটন। মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্র দপ্তরের মানবাধিকার বিষয়ক বার্ষিক প্রতিবেদনের প্রতিক্রিয়ায় এসব মন্তব্য করেন ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার মুখপাত্র জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ।  
      
    উক্ত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে দাবি করা হয়, তালিবান সরকারের অধীনে আফগানিস্তানে মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষা উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে হ্রাস পেয়েছে। নারী অধিকার ও মত প্রকাশের স্বাধীনতা লঙ্ঘিত হয়েছে।  
      
    জবাবে মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ বলেন, আফগানিস্তানে কোনও মার্কিন দূতাবাস নেই। তাই তাদের পক্ষে আফগানিস্তানের বাস্তবতা, অগ্রগতি বা মানবাধিকারের বিষয়গুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করা চলে না। এই প্রতিবেদনগুলোর সাথে রাজনৈতিক উদ্দেশ্য জড়িত, অধিকাংশ প্রতিবেদন ষড়যন্ত্রের হাতিয়ার হিসেবে প্রকাশ করা হয়ে থাকে।  
      
    তিনি জোর দিয়ে বলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উচিত মার্কিন দখলদারিত্বের সময়ের সাথে আফগানিস্তানের বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি তুলনা করা, মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে কোন সময়কালটি অধিক উত্তম সেটা তারা অনুধাবন করুক।  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, আফগান ইস্যু নিয়ে আমেরিকার উদ্বিগ্ন হওয়া উচিত নয়, কেননা নাগরিকদের অধিকার সম্পর্কে বর্তমান সরকার অবগত আছে। আফগানিস্তানের একটি একটি ধর্মীয় ও আইনি দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি রয়েছে, নাগরিকদের অধিকার নিশ্চিত করতে এখানে ধর্মীয় বাধ্যবাধকতা রয়েছে।

    **ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার চার বছরের অর্জন: সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক দু’ক্ষেত্রেই বিজয়**
    
    ! <image:4231>
    
      
      
      
    আফগানিস্তানে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শাসন পুনঃপ্রতিষ্ঠার চার বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। এ উপলক্ষে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার কর্মকর্তারা সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রে নিজেদের অর্জনের ওপর আলোকপাত করেছেন।  
      
    গত ১৩ আগস্ট কাতারে অবস্থিত ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার দূতাবাসের ভারপ্রাপ্ত প্রধান সুহাইল শাহিন হাফিযাহুল্লাহ জানান, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার বিজয় অর্জনের ফলে শত্রুদের রাজনৈতিক ও কৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ব্যর্থ হয়েছে এবং দেশের প্রশাসনিক কাঠামো আরও মজবুত হয়েছে।  
      
    তিনি বলেন, ‘এই বিজয়ের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া শুধু সামরিক নয়, রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রেও সফলতা অর্জন করেছে। এই উদ্যোগ আফগানিস্তানে ইসলামি শাসন প্রতিষ্ঠার পথকে সুগম করেছে।’  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার সদস্যদের প্রচেষ্টা ও আফগান জনগণের ত্যাগের কারণে বিশ্ব শক্তি ও তাদের মিত্ররা পরাজিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এর আগে, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার জ্যেষ্ঠ নেতা আনাস হাক্কানি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ দোহা চুক্তিকে আফগানিস্তানে আমেরিকার পরাজয়ের লিখিত স্বীকৃতি হিসেবে বর্ণনা করেন। তিনি বলেন, চুক্তির মাধ্যমে আমেরিকা ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তর করতে বাধ্য হয়েছিল, যদিও শুরুতে তারা আলোচনা এড়িয়ে গিয়েছিল। হাক্কানি জানান, তালিবান পারস্পরিক সমঝোতার মাধ্যমে ক্ষমতায় আসতে চাইলেও সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট আশরাফ ঘানির হঠাৎ পলায়ন সেই পরিকল্পনায় পরিবর্তন আনে।

## Elaboration
The image <image:34>

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image appears in multiple sources, including reports about the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. The claim states the event happened in October 2024, which is a year later. The image is also used in a forum post about an attack in August 2025.

The claim is not factually accurate because the image is misrepresented in a new context. The image is from 2023, not 2024. `false`

## Elaboration
The image <image:34>

## Final Judgement
The image appears in multiple sources, including reports about the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. The claim states the event happened in October 2024, which is a year later. The image is also used in a forum post about an attack in August 2025.

The claim is not factually accurate because the image is misrepresented in a new context. The image is from 2023, not 2024. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image of the burning tank, <image:34>, is associated with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, as reported by sources like [9jaflaver.com](https://9jaflaver.com/israel-declares-state-of-war-after-hamas-militants-launch-surprise-attack-from-gaza-videos/) and [Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/7868168/israel-declares-war-readiness-hamas). The claim that the event occurred in October 2024 is therefore inaccurate.

*   Mocking posts by Israeli soldiers going viral
*   Some experts say posts may breach international law

March 28 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 as a looming [famine](/world/middle-east/destruction-lawlessness-red-tape-hobble-aid-gazans-go-hungry-2024-03-25/)
 intensifies world scrutiny of Israel's offensive.

In one video, an Israeli soldier sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa.

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Fmiddle-east%2Fisraeli-soldiers-play-with-gaza-womens-underwear-online-posts-2024-03-28%2F)

Elsewhere, another soldier sits atop a tank holding a female mannequin dressed in a black bra and helmet and says: "I found a beautiful wife, serious relationship in Gaza, great woman."

The two videos shot by Israeli soldiers are among dozens of posts in which troops in Gaza are shown displaying lingerie, mannequins, and in some cases both. Human Rights Office spokesperson.

Reuters sent details of the eight verified posts on YouTube or Instagram to the Israel Defense Forces, requesting comment.

In response, a spokesperson sent a statement saying the IDF investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values of IDF soldiers, as well as reports of videos uploaded to social networks.

"In cases where suspicion of a criminal offense arises that justifies opening an investigation, an investigation is opened by the Military Police," it said.

"It should be clarified that in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the video is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly," the statement said.

The IDF declined to say whether it was referring to any of the images highlighted by Reuters, or whether any of the soldiers responsible have been disciplined.

The Israeli soldiers whom Reuters was able to identify did not respond to requests for comment sent via their social media accounts.

**\[1/2\]**An Israeli soldier holds underwear over the face of a fellow Israeli soldier in a screengrab from a video obtained by Reuters, released on January 10, 2024, said to be filmed in Gaza. Instagram did not comment.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza was launched in response to an attack on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

The experts also said there was convincing information that some Israeli hostages taken to Gaza had been subjected to sexual violence which may still be ongoing.

Israel stands accused of pushing Gaza towards famine. By contrast, he said, posts showing weapons or Hamas flags said to have been found in Gazan homes have been circulating widely.

The authenticated posts include a photo of a soldier holding a bare female mannequin from behind with his hands on its breasts and one of a soldier handling a half-naked doll.

One photo shows a soldier posing with his gun, making a thumbs-up gesture, in front of a double bed strewn with packets of women's underwear.

YouTube said it had removed a video flagged by Reuters for violating the platform's harassment policies, which prohibit content that reveals someone's personally identifiable information. experts also said in its [recent report, opens new tab](https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/report/mission-report-official-visit-of-the-office-of-the-srsg-svc-to-israel-and-the-occupied-west-bank-29-january-14-february-2024/20240304-Israel-oWB-CRSV-report.pdf)
 that it had received information from institutional and civil society sources and direct interviews in the West Bank about sexual violence against Palestinians by the IDF.

Both sides reject accusations of sexual violence.

The lingerie and mannequin posts do not compare in gravity to the alleged crimes against women reported since Oct."

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/4/12/weaponising-underwear-genocide-with-a-semi-pornographic-twist): 
Content: "A [recent Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-play-with-gaza-womens-underwear-online-posts-2024-03-28/)
 titled “Israeli soldiers play with Gaza women’s underwear in online posts” describes how combatants from the world’s self-appointed “most moral army” have been “posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the war in Gaza”.

In one video highlighted by Reuters, an Israeli soldier “sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa”.

Another visually “dissonant” episode features a solider perched on a tank, who proceeds to introduce his “beautiful wife”: a female mannequin sporting a helmet and black bra.

In response to the news agency’s inquiry, an Israeli military spokesperson “sent a statement saying the \[army\] investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values” of Israeli soldiers.

And yet it is pretty perverse in itself to even talk about “values” in the middle of a [genocide](/news/2024/3/26/un-expert-accuses-israel-of-several-acts-of-genocide-in-gaza)
 and Israeli-made [famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NCbfeEX3Ds)
 in the Gaza Strip.

Since October 7, Israel has [killed](/news/liveblog/2024/4/10/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-bombards-gaza-kills-14-in-nuseirat-camp?update=2828500)
 nearly 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, among them some 14,500 children and 9,500 women – numbers which are presumed to be grave underestimates. 8, 2023 \[AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg\]

Let’s pretend for a moment that, in the course of waging war against the state of Israel, Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip had taken to posing for social media posts with lingerie belonging to Israeli women who had been forced to flee their homes and/or killed in the war.

Imagine the moral outrage that would swiftly ensue, inevitably entailing racist and self-righteous allegations of Arab perverseness, the barbaric sexism of Islam, and the violent tendencies of sexually repressed Muslims.

The Fox Newses of the world would have had a field day.

As it turns out, a version of this hypothetical spectacle is true – except that it stars Israeli soldiers and Palestinian women’s lingerie. Children are [starving](/program/newsfeed/2024/3/27/videos-of-malnourished-children-show-gazas-forced-starvation-crisis)
 to death.

Rather than constituting an isolated blot on the morality of the Israeli armed forces, then, social media posts of Palestinian women’s underwear would seem to be aligned with general moral depravity and therefore entirely consistent with Israeli military “values”.

The United Nations Human Rights Office spokesperson has declared such posts to be “demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women”. In December, dozens of Palestinian men and boys sheltering at two Gaza schools were detained by the Israeli army, [stripped to their underwear](/news/2023/12/8/video-photos-appear-to-show-detainees-stripped-to-underwear-in-gaza)
, and made to kneel on the ground.

The degradation of Palestinian women is all the more obscenely hypocritical, however, in light of the Israeli military’s condemnation of Hamas for its “discrimination” against women in the territory it controls. A 2022 report by Israel’s State Comptroller, for example, found that approximately one-third of Israeli women performing mandatory military service had experienced sexual harassment the previous year.

The state of Israel has also weaponised the bikini-clad and otherwise half-naked bodies of its female fighting forces in order to effectively sexualise ethnic cleansing, as in the case of the 2007 Maxim magazine spread that tantalisingly wondered whether Israel’s female militants were not in fact “the world’s sexiest soldiers”.

As for the current lingerie tactic being deployed by social media-savvy troops in Gaza, the weaponisation of humiliation only compounds the suffering of Palestinian women – and men – who, forced to flee their homes, have already had their intimate space violated in every possible way.

And as the Israeli military simultaneously gets off playing with underwear and perpetrating genocide, it is a “dissonant visual record”, indeed.

An Israeli soldier stands in an apartment during a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Nov. Ultimately, the taunting display of Palestinian lingerie amounts to an almost pathetically cliched violation of the intimate space of Gazan women. More than 76,000 people have been wounded as homes, hospitals, [schools](/news/2024/1/24/how-israel-has-destroyed-gazas-schools-and-universities)
 and everything else that is bombable have been bombed. But to be playing around with the panties of people you are killing takes depravity to another level.

Call it Orientalist fetishization with a genocidal twist.

Granted, it’s not just the females of Gaza who are eligible for such “demeaning” treatment; Gazan males can be intimately humiliated, too. A section on the military’s English-language website devoted to “The Status of Women in Gaza” laments that “basic rights are often systematically denied” to females, who are faced with “decreased educational opportunities” as well as “limited employment opportunities” – a situation that is clearly best rectified by Israel’s bombing of [most such opportunities](/news/2023/12/20/gaza-essential-uninhabitable-as-infrastructure-damage-kills-job-market)
 to smithereens.

The website reports that “violence against women continues at alarming rates” in the Gaza Strip."

The Israeli look-outs say they began to see unfamiliar faces in Gaza before the Hamas attack

Several watchwomen who did fear a major attack was coming have told the BBC they felt their concerns were not being listened to.

When she noticed the vans on the border, Roni says the protocol was to alert her commander and then to keep watching until the vehicles were no longer in her section. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final._

* * * The attack they had long feared was now actually happening.

Because of the locations of their bases, the women of this military unit - known as tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew - were among the first Israelis that Hamas reached after rampaging out of Gaza.

'Our job is to protect all residents'
-------------------------------------

The women sit inside rooms close to the border, staring for hours every day at live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the high-tech fence, and balloons that hover over Gaza.

There are several of these units next to the Gaza fence, and others at different positions along Israel's borders. <image:13204>!Map of Gaza with partial view of Israel, showing border fence, IDF observation bases, armed group drill sites and sites of Hamas incursion <image:13211>

Retired IDF Maj Gen Eitan Dangot says the tatzpitaniyot play a major role in "pushing the button that says something is wrong", and that concerns they raise with a commander should be passed up the chain "to create an intelligence picture".

He says the look-outs provide key "pieces of the puzzle" in understanding any threats.

In the months leading up to the Hamas attacks, senior Israeli officials gave public statements suggesting that the threat posed by Hamas had been contained.

But there were many signs along the border that something was very wrong.

! <image:13204>!Stills from Hamas training video on how to break through the Israeli border fence <image:13215>

At a different base along the border, Gal (not her real name), says she was also watching as the training increased.

She watched, via surveillance balloon, as a replica model of an automated Israeli weapon on the border was built "in the heart of Gaza", she says.

Several women also describe bombs being planted and detonated near the fence - known as Israel's Iron Wall - seemingly to test its strength. Israel has said this was one of the "leading forces" behind the October attacks.

Roni's account matches that of another woman at the base who spoke to the BBC.

*   [Israel Gaza: What Gaza's death toll says about the war](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67764664)
    

Some of the watchwomen also speak of growing incidents of attempted incursions.

Messages shared with us by one female soldier make reference in code to vans along the border, as well as to the IDF stopping people trying to cross into Israel, which she says was happening more frequently. <image:13204>!Stills from Hamas video on how to disable an Israeli tank <image:13223>

Avigail says that even when senior officials came to the base "no-one would talk to us or ask our opinion or tell us a little about what was going on".

"They just came, gave a task and left," she says.

'Why are we here if no-one's listening?'
----------------------------------------

As a commander at her unit, Gal says observers would pass information to her which she then passed to her supervisor.

But she says that while this was included in "situation assessments" - when higher-ups at the base would discuss the reports filed by the observers - nothing seemed to be done beyond that.

Several of the women say they voiced their frustrations and worries with their families.

Shahaf's mother, Ilana, remembers her saying: "Why are we here if no-one's listening?"

"She told me that the girls see that there is a mess. <image:13204>!BBC Female soldiers who guarded Israel's border <image:13205>BBC

**They are known as Israel's eyes on the Gaza border.**

For years, units of young female conscripts had one job here. To some of them it became a dark joke: who would be on duty when the inevitable attack came?

These women were not the only ones raising the alarm, and as more testimony is gathered, anger at the Israeli state - and questions over its response - are mounting.

The BBC has spoken also to the grieving families who have now lost their daughters, and to experts who see the IDF's response to these women as part of a broader intelligence failure. <image:13204>!Shai Ashra, posing with hands on hips, in military fatigues <image:13209>

Shai Ashram - her father says she loved being a soldier

As Hamas attacked, the women at Nahal Oz, a base about a kilometre from the Gaza border, began to say goodbye to one another on their shared WhatsApp group.

Noa, who was not on duty and was reading the messages from home, remembers thinking "this is it"."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim cannot be verified. While the search results show images of Israeli tanks and women soldiers, and also images of clotheslines, none of the evidence supports the specific scenario described in the claim. The evidence does not mention a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

Content: "Out of 135,000 tents, 110,000 are completely worn out and urgently need replacement,” it said.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said many tent sites are near the coast and are not designed to withstand “these horrific conditions”, especially as colder weather approaches.

“The rising tide has damaged many of these tents, leaving people with little hope and no dry clothes to protect themselves,” he said.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has warned that half a million people across the besieged enclave are at risk in areas hit by flooding.

“The situation will only get worse with every drop of rain, every bomb, every strike,” the agency said on X.

Meanwhile on Monday, Israeli attacks intensified across the enclave.

In Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, an Israeli air attack killed at least four people, medics said, while tanks deepened their incursions in Beit Hanoon, Beit Lahiya, and Jabalia – the largest of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps.

Medics said seven Palestinian people were also killed by two Israeli air attacks in Jabalia.

Residents in Gaza said Israeli planes also dropped new leaflets on Beit Lahiya ordering remaining residents to leave the northern city for the south, saying the area would come under attack and providing them with a map.

Palestinian people say Israel appears determined to depopulate the area permanently to create a buffer zone along the northern edge of Gaza. Our clothes got wet and we have nothing to protect ourselves, just the tent,” said Um Mohammad Marouf, a displaced Beit Lahiya resident.

Many [tents](/gallery/2024/11/25/heavy-rains-flood-tents-in-gaza-bringing-further-misery-to-palestinians)
 used in the early stages of Israel’s war in Gaza have now worn out and no longer offer protection. ![Gaza flood](/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-25T110219Z_849263743_RC2ACBA5QWAT_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1732533672.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Heavy rains have flooded tent encampments of displaced Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, adding misery to communities already devastated by 13 months of war, as Israeli forces stepped up attacks in the enclave.

Some placed water buckets on the ground to protect mats from leaks and dug trenches to drain water away from their tents.

“We left the north and survived the bombings. I’ve been sick for three days,” Ahmad, a displaced resident of Jabalia, northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera in a tent camp in Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City.

“We were affected by the rain. The price of new tents and plastic sheeting has also shot up beyond the means of displaced families.

On Monday, Gaza’s Government Media Office said in a statement that about 10,000 tents were either washed away or damaged due to the storm, appealing for international help to provide displaced families with tents to shield them against the rain and cold.

“According to government field assessment teams, 81 percent of the displaced persons’ tents are no longer usable. Israel has repeatedly denied this accusation.

Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 44,235 Palestinians and wounded 104,638 since October 7, 2023.

An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day and more than 200 were taken captive.

\- Walking barefoot -

With two-thirds of Gaza's population living in poverty even before the war, many people were forced to sell their clothes once the conflict broke out and tanked the economy further.

But "there are no more shoes or clothes to sell", says Omar Abu Hashem, 25, who was displaced from Rafah, on the Egyptian border, to Khan Yunis further north.

Abu Hashem left his home in such a rush that he was unable to take anything with him. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

For months, Safaa Yassin has dressed her child in the same white bodysuit, an all-too-familiar tale in the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by 10 months of war.

"When I was pregnant, I dreamed of dressing my daughter in beautiful clothes. Today, I have nothing to put on her," says Yassin, one of thousands of Palestinians displaced from Gaza City.

"I never thought that one day I wouldn't be able to dress my children," says the 38-year-old, now living in Al-Mawasi, a coastal area designated as a humanitarian zone by Israeli forces.

"But the few clothes I found before evacuating to the south were either the wrong size or not suitable for the season," she adds, as Gaza bakes in summertime temperatures of 30-plus degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) every day.

Finding clothing -- any clothing -- has become increasingly difficult for the 2.4 million people living in the territory besieged by Israel.

Gaza once had a thriving textiles industry but since the war began on October 7 with Palestinian group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel, it has received just a trickle of goods.

Faten Juda also struggles to dress her 15-month-old son, Adam, who is squeezed into ill-fitting pyjamas, his bare arms and legs sticking out from the tight fabric.

"He's growing every day and his clothes don't fit him anymore, but I can't find any others," the 30-year-old tells AFP.

\- Same headscarf -

Children are not the only ones suffering from the lack of clothing in the Gaza Strip, which counted 900 textile factories in the industry's heyday in the early 1990s.

The sector employed 35,000 people and sent four million items to Israel every month. With limited water to wash them, disease-spreading lice abound.

Ahmed al-Masri, 29, left his home in the north of Gaza at the start of the war.

Today in Khan Younis, in the south, he says he does not have any spare shoes or clothes.

"My shoes are extremely damaged. I quickly wash my T-shirt and then I wait for it to dry," he says.

"And all this, without soap or detergent."

[What the End of Federal Reserve Independence Could Mean](https://english.aawsat.com/features/5181100-what-end-federal-reserve-independence-could-mean)

========================================================================================================================================================

![An eagle tops the US Federal Reserve building's facade in Washington, July 31, 2013. But those numbers have plummeted since 2007, when Hamas took power and Israel blockaded Gaza.

In recent years, Gaza's workshops had dwindled to about 100, employing about 4,000 people and shipping about 30,000-40,000 items a month to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

By January, three months into the war, the World Bank estimated that 79 percent of Gaza's private sector establishments had been partially or totally destroyed.

Even the factories that are still standing have ground to a halt, after months without electricity in Gaza."

Content: "“I’ve seen military conflict for years and years,” he said, “and it solves nothing.”

On a trip to Gaza during the second intifada, I met one of the founders of Hamas, a former surgeon named Mahmoud al-Zahar. In the fields near Gaza, troops, tanks, and armored personnel had started to establish positions for the planned ground invasion.

An I.D.F. It will stay as a way of thinking, as an idea, so long as there is a Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” He went on, “People say there is more support for Hamas in the West Bank than in Gaza and the reverse is true in Gaza, that there is more support for the P.A. Like many reporters, I’d accepted an invitation to see video evidence of the worst massacre of Jews in generations, certainly in the history of Israel—Hamas’s [rampage](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/waking-to-an-attack-from-hamas)
 through Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Kibbutz Be’eri, and other communities near the Gaza Strip, extending to [an outdoor electronic-music festival, Nova](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-massacre-came-to-a-music-festival-in-israel)
. At last count, the attack throughout what Israelis call Otef Aza—“the Gaza envelope”—had claimed some fourteen hundred lives; thousands were wounded, and around two hundred and twenty people had been [kidnapped](https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/a-father-reckons-with-the-hostage-taking-of-his-family-in-southern-israel)
 and taken to the Gaza Strip. The only thing that might slow you down was a siren, a warning that a rocket was headed north out of Gaza toward Tel Aviv and other cities. And, having delivered a message of ardent support flecked with notes of caution against being consumed with rage and making the kinds of catastrophic mistakes that the United States made in the wake of 9/11, the President was in the air again, headed back to Washington.

The night before, in Tel Aviv at a friend’s house for dinner, I received a series of WhatsApp messages from Mosab Abu Toha, a thirty-year-old poet who [lives with his wife and children in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/the-view-from-my-window-in-gaza)
. Born in the Al-Shati refugee camp, in Gaza City, he left the Strip for the first time four years ago. Now Mosab, in one-sentence bursts, was saying that the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, in Zeitoun, a southern district of Gaza City, had been bombed by Israeli warplanes: “God help us.” He sent images—first of a burning building and a prostrate man, presumably dead, in the street—and he relayed reports of body counts:

“Between 200 and 300 got killed.”

Then: “More than 500 were killed in the hospital.”

Then: “More than 800.”

Then: “It’s now 1,115 people killed in the bombing of the hospital in Gaza.”

He was not claiming authority or proximity to the hospital but conveying the alarm on his own social networks. “Sorry to send this,” he added as a caption, “but this is one victim in the hospital’s massacre.”

The body of a Hamas fighter lies on the ground outside a burned home in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz near the border with Gaza.Photograph by Peter van Agtmael / Magnum for The New Yorker

Soon everyone at the dinner table was getting push alerts—from Israeli media, from the wires, from CNN, the BBC, the _Times_."

The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67958260](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67958260)) discusses the role of female soldiers guarding the Gaza border, including images of the border fence, IDF observation bases, and training videos (<image:13204>, <image:13211>, <image:13215>, <image:13223>, <image:13205>, <image:13209>).

The image of the tank (<image:36>) is not mentioned in any of the provided sources.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Swissinfo.ch published an article with an image of Israeli soldiers on a tank (<image:13232>). The New York Times published an article about Israeli tanks and women soldiers (<image:13233>). VPM.org shows a photograph of a girl sitting outside with clothes hanging on a clothesline (<image:13234>).

The provided sources do not contain information about a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza.


## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. While the search results show images of Israeli tanks and women soldiers, and also images of clotheslines, none of the evidence supports the specific scenario described in the claim. The evidence does not mention a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza.

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\
------------------------------](/portfolio/927-hamas-israel-war)

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל: לפני זמן קצר נורה טיל לעבר בית פרטי ביישוב אביבים שבמועצה האזורית מרום הגליל. נגרם נזק לבית, לא היו נפגעים.

ראש המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל עמית סופר: "עוד בית שניזוק באביבים. היישוב חטף עד כה עשרות טילים מסוגים שונים והנזקים לרכוש הם בהיקפים גדולים ומשמעותיים כך גם יישובים סמוכים. כל מתקפה כזו משפיעה על כל היישובים שלא פונו. אני מקווה שמינוי הפרויקטור ייבשר את הזרמת התקציבים והמענים הכה דחופים בצפון"

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461): 
Content: "Around a third of the approximately 100 international staff working in Gaza will be temporarily relocated.

After cutting off all humanitarian aid into Gaza for three weeks – the longest suspension since 7 October 2023 – Israeli officials have indicated that they intend to continue their military campaign across Gaza and annex territory to pressure Hamas.

**Strike on UN compound from ‘Israeli tank’**
---------------------------------------------

The UN Spokesperson said that based on currently available information**, “**[**the strikes hitting a UN compound**](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261)
 **in Deir Al Balah on 19 March were caused by an Israeli tank.”**.

In the aftermath of Wednesday’s strike, Israel said it had not been behind the blast.

“The strikes claimed the life of a UN colleague from Bulgaria and left six others – from France, Moldova, North Macedonia, Palestine and the United Kingdom – with severe injuries, some of them life-altering,” Monday’s statement continued.

The location of the compound was well known to all the parties to the conflict.

“I reiterate that all parties to the conflict are bound by international law to protect the absolute inviolability of UN premises,” the statement from Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric continued.

“Without this, our colleagues face intolerable risks as they work to save the lives of civilians.”

The Secretary-General is demanding a full, thorough and independent investigation into Wednesday’s deadly strike, protection of all civilian life in the renewed fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas and the resumption of aid deliveries.

Furthermore, all hostages “must be released immediately and unconditionally”.

**‘Relentless bombardment’ again**
----------------------------------

One week since Israeli bombing started again in Gaza, UN humanitarians have described deadly attacks hitting health workers, ambulances and hospitals.

Senior UN humanitarian in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Jonathan Whittall, said that hundreds of children and adults have been killed since the ceasefire broke down between Hamas and Israel.

The UN agency for Palestine refugees, [UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
, also said on Monday that 124,000 people in the enclave have been forced to flee what it called “relentless bombardment”.

“**Families carry what little they have with no shelter, no safety, and nowhere left to go**; the Israeli authorities have cut off all aid,” UNRWA said in an online statement – warning that food is scarce and prices are soaring as the Israeli blockade continues.

Relief chief Tom Fletcher tweeted that he was continuing to receive horrific reports from Gaza of more health workers, ambulances and hospitals attacked as they try to save survivors. [Skip to main content / navigation](#main-content)

Guterres to reduce UN aid ‘footprint’ inside Gaza following ceasefire collapse
==============================================================================

24 March 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The [UN Secretary-General](https://www.un.org/sg/en)
 on Monday took the “difficult decision” to reduce the aid operation inside the Gaza Strip following the resumption of deadly Israeli airstrikes – but pledged that “the UN is not leaving” the enclave.

"In the past week, Israel carried out devastating strikes on Gaza, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians, including United Nations personnel, with no humanitarian aid being allowed to enter the Strip since early March,” [said a statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2025-03-24/note-correspondents-gaza)
 released by his Spokesperson.

> [](https://twitter.com/UNOCHA/statuses/1904196628229312916)

“As a result, **the Secretary-General has taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar** and our concern over the protection of civilians intensifies.”

The UN stressed that it remained fully committed to providing lifesaving aid. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said four of its ambulances were targeted, as well as 10 team members carrying out humanitarian work.

“Communication with the team has been completely lost for 30 hours, and at this point, their fate remains unknown,” the UN Spokesperson continued.

**Call for additional emergency teams**
---------------------------------------

As hostilities continue across Gaza, aid coordination office, [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/)
, and partners called for the entry of additional emergency medical teams into Gaza to help health workers already on the ground who are “exhausted and, of course, overwhelmed.”

Israeli authorities on Sunday issued a new evacuation order in Rafah, covering around two per cent of the Strip and affecting five neighbourhoods.

“With this latest directive, the overall area designated for evacuation over the past week covers an estimated 14 per cent of the Gaza Strip – along  with vast 'no go' zones along the borders and the Netzarim corridor,” Mr. Fletcher said we all must demand that hospitals and medics must not be targeted.

In southern Gaza on Sunday, several casualties were reported after the surgical department of Nasser Medical Complex was hit and caught fire, Mr. Dujarric told journalists in New York at the daily briefing.

In Rafah, ambulances were reportedly hit in Tal Al Sultan, resulting in several casualties. Dujarric said.

CAIRO, March 17 (Reuters) - An Israeli air strike killed three Palestinian men in Gaza on Monday as they tried to gather firewood, medics said, with no sign of progress in renewed talks on sustaining a ceasefire deal between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas.

That has become a daily task for many Gazans as Israel has continued to ban fuel, food, and medical goods from entering Gaza for over two weeks, residents said.

The Israeli military said in a statement it struck "terrorists" operating near their forces and attempting to plant a bomb.

At Al-Aqsa Hospital in Gaza's Deir Al-Balah, relatives rushed to pay farewell to the three white-shrouded bodies.

"They were targeted - and when their cousins and others in the area came to rescue them, the drone targeted them with bombs," said Jabr Abou Hajeer, the father of one of the victims.

Later on Monday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed a father and his son inside a school sheltering displaced families in Bureij camp, near the site of the earlier strikes, raising the day's death toll to five.

The Israeli military said the strike hit two people who were attempting to plant a bomb in the ground near where forces operated in Bureij.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said Israel's "violations" could "undermine all efforts for de-escalation".

He put the number of Palestinians killed since the January ceasefire at 150.

**\[1/6\]**Palestinians inspect the site of an Israeli strike on a house, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip March 18. Hamas says it will resume freeing hostages only under the second phase that was due to begin on March 2.

Israel and Hamas have been holding successive talks with Egyptian mediators in Cairo.

Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said on Monday that while his group was complying with the terms of the truce, Israel "seeks to foil the agreement and impose new conditions".

On Friday, Hamas said it had agreed to release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and four bodies of the hostages if Israel agreed to begin talks immediately on implementing the second phase of the agreement. Israel accused Hamas of waging ["psychological warfare"](/world/middle-east/hamas-release-american-hostage-gaza-ready-second-phase-ceasefire-talks-2025-03-14/)
 on hostage families.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said negotiators had been instructed to be ready to continue talks based on the mediators' response to a U.S. Additional reporting by Tala Ramadan; Editing by Timothy Heritage, Aidan Lewis, William Maclean

Gaza's latest war began when Hamas led a cross-border raid into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Responding to a series of Israeli strikes across the occupied Gaza Strip overnight which killed at least 414 Palestinians, including 174 children, and hospitalized over 550 more, signalling a unilateral end to the truce with Hamas, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard said:

“Today is a desperately dark day for humanity. Israel brazenly resumed its devastating bombing campaign in Gaza killing at least 414 people in their sleep, including 174 children, and again wiping out entire families in a matter of hours. Since 2 March, Israel has re-imposed a total siege on Gaza blocking the entry of all humanitarian aid, medicine, and commercial supplies, including fuel and food, in flagrant violation of international law. Palestinians in Gaza – who have barely had a chance to start piecing together their lives and continue to grapple with the trauma of Israel’s past attacks – have woken up once more to the hellish nightmare of intense bombardment.

> 
> Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard

“Israel’s genocide and its unlawful air strikes have already caused unprecedented humanitarian suffering in Gaza. Israel has also cut off electricity to Gaza’s main operational desalination plant. And today the Israeli military has once again started issuing mass ‘evacuation’ orders displacing Palestinians.

“Amnesty International’s researchers spoke to medical staff working at three hospitals in Gaza City and North Gaza governorate who described scenes of unspeakable horror beginning in the early hours of the morning. Al-Shifa, once the largest medical complex in Gaza, now largely destroyed by past Israeli military raids, had only three beds to receive the wounded.

“Al-Ahli Arab Baptist hospital in Gaza City – the only hospital with a functioning intensive care unit – was forced to treat some of the 80 wounded it received in the corridors and in the hospital’s yard. The Indonesian hospital is the only hospital in north Gaza Governorate that is barely functioning.  

“The near-total decimation of the healthcare system in Gaza, particularly in the north, and the desperate shortages in medical equipment and supplies, exacerbated by Israel’s unlawful siege, effectively means a death sentence for many of those with serious injuries and illnesses, including those that in normal conditions would be easily curable. All the while, Israeli authorities continue to impose extremely tight restrictions on medical evacuations outside Gaza."

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/)
 is calling on Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s [visit to an ammunition plant](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.

The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy [addressed the United Nations](https://apnews.com/video/war-and-unrest-ukraine-government-ukraine-russia-government-russia-eae042530895412f9447f6c70f7f27c1)
 in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the [war effort](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 before [meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489)
.

“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.

Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.

An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.

Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.

The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.

While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.

Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.”

Zelenskyy visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-75a9ca2e3be09578c65f1198ba5b72e5)
 to thank the workers who are producing one of the [most critically needed munitions](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)
 for [his country’s fight](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 to fend off Russian ground forces.

The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture [155 mm artillery shells](https://apnews.com/article/155mm-howitzer-ukraine-ammunition-russia-7d966c85046b73db2b013f93c51af2a5)
 and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.

“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

“Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”

Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.

Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he [visited Utah](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-governors-c777901001422bbc5e0885a1824a67c9)
 to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans.

The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.

However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.

“If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

Five potential conflicts: Which could turn nuclear? There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

! “We are taking the necessary measures and have delivered the required messages.” He added that the Syrian Democratic Force’s (SDF) understanding with Damascus requires a “joint establishment of a new Syria,” while emphasizing that Turkey maintains ties with other Kurdish groups open to cooperation.

Fidan also addressed comments by Turkish President Recep Erdogan, saying Ankara would not hesitate to act if threatened. <image:12233>

US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan within an informal meeting of The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) foreign ministers in Antalya, on May 15, 2025. Speaking to TGRT television, he criticized Israel’s involvement in Syria and voiced opposition to attempts at ethnic division under the guise of “preserving national identity.”

“Syria is next to us, and any unrest there directly affects us,” Fidan said. Abdulkadir Selvi, a journalist close to the government, wrote in Hürriyet that US Special Representative for Syria Tom Barrack has adopted “a softer tone.” Barrack, who once insisted on “one nation, one people, one army, and one Syria,” has reportedly floated the idea of a “looser arrangement.”

“This stance by the US ambassador has caused concern in Ankara,” Selvi wrote, suggesting the shift may signal changes in Washington’s Syria policy.

**Regional Tensions Over Minority Demands**

Selvi also reported that Israel has pressed the US administration to secure privileges for Druze communities [under its influence in Syria](https://levant24.com/tag/hijri/)
. He claimed the SDF and affiliated groups are using those demands as leverage to seek similar concessions.

Amid these competing pressures, Abdi has resisted full integration into the Syrian army despite the March 10 agreement and calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. (AFP)

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said developments in Syria remain a critical concern for Ankara, warning that any unrest directly impacts Turkey. Joe Wilson, centered on integrating the forces into the Syrian state through a decentralized model.

From [Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/): 
Content: "“With some international and local powers now adopting federal or decentralized models, Israel believes the time is right to apply military pressure to consolidate this model, particularly in the south, as a first step toward sharing influence and ensuring secure borders to strengthen influence in the northeast with the Syrian Defense Forces.”

Aware of the [fragility](https://snhr.org/blog/2025/03/11/803-individuals-extrajudicially-killed-between-march-6-10-2025/)
 that Sharaa’s government faces from the multiplicity of actors vying for control, however, Turkey has worked to strengthen the central government by using its own political card with Kurdish political factions to try to bring a close to any fragmentation of the Syrian state, even if it sees Erdogan drop a long held ideological mainstay.

Underlining Ankara’s seriousness, the first foreign visit to Syria after the fall of Assad came from Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin in December. “I believe that it is still a little early to talk about the dissolution of the forces in Syria because we have one demand, which is the establishment of a decentralized authority for the Kurds in northern Syria,” the SDF military commander says. 

Nearly three months after the agreement was signed, Turkey’s [patience](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/290520251)
 was wearing thin.

In a meeting between Sharaa and Erdogan on May 24, the two sides discussed the formulation of a common vision to end “the ongoing threat” posed by the Kurdish forces to Syria’s territorial integrity and Turkey’s national security, through direct field and security coordination, says the source close to the Turkish president.

Speaking after a round of technical talks in Baku in April between the Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan tried to downplay what was on everyone’s mind.

With a shake of a hand in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in mid May, Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa completed his political transformation.

Gone was the man who once had an American [bounty](https://x.com/DigitalOutreach/status/862320076241993730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E862320076241993730%7Ctwgr%5E7104739bc23ce28a874a34d36e623f1bbb993594%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmonitor.com%2F20170511-dead-or-alive-us-offers-10-million-for-syria-rebel-commander%2F)
 of US$10 million on his head. As the pace of the Israeli attacks continued unabated after the ouster of Assad, several diplomatic pathways emerged, the most public of which have been the [talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-israel-have-begun-talks-avoid-clashes-syria-turkish-sources-say-2025-04-10/)
 between Turkey and Israel in the Azerbaijani capital Baku aimed at creating a “technical mechanism” to reduce “unwanted incidents” in Syria.

According to a former Syrian diplomat, the Israeli attacks in the south of Syria are in part driven by a concern about Turkey’s potential influence near Israeli-held territory.

“After Iran’s withdrawal from Syria, Turkey is looking to fill the vacuum by striking understandings with the new leadership in Damascus,” the diplomat says. The pitch included promises for a [Trump Tower](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tower-damascus-syria-seeks-charm-us-president-sanctions-relief-2025-05-11/)
 in Damascus to hosting Jonathan Bass, a pro-Trump Republican activist and CEO of Argent LNG, a natural gas company based in Louisiana, to [discuss](https://sana.sy/en/?p=354232)
 developing the country’s energy resources with Western firms and a new US-listed Syrian national oil company.

In the weeks leading up to the US summit, it was clear what the US and Israel wanted: normalization between the Syrian regime and Israel. 

For countries with sway in Damascus, the question was who would take the lead.

It was Saudi Arabia, a Syrian political source, close to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, says that those in Damascus were calling “Washington’s reconciliation Godfather.” Keen to [cement](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-saudi-arabia-have-discussed-riyadhs-potential-purchase-f-35-jets-2025-05-13/)
 a lucrative defense agreement with the kingdom, long thought to be the carrot to induce Saudi-Israeli normalization, the US was willing to accommodate what the regional diplomat says was a desire to be seen “as the card holder of the Syrian situation in the region.”

And that accommodation went so far as securing a promise from Trump to lift all sanctions on the Syrian regime, the regional diplomat adds — a promise that bucked a widespread belief in the American capital of a [“cautious, incrementalist approach.”](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/president-trumps-gulf-trip-whirlwind-three-days-region)

For Sharaa’s government, weak as it is, a turn to Riyadh allowed them to hide behind the much more powerful actor in Saudi Arabia, who has thus far refused to accept a move forward with normalization with Israel.

“It’s no secret that the US intends to encourage Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords convoy alongside the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco. Gone was the moniker that had marked his existential opposition to Israel, his diluted jihadi branding, itself the rebrand of a rebrand.

Sharaa was now a man who could stand in front of the US president, shake his hand and discuss the “New Syria” after decades of civil war, sanctions and authoritarian rule had fractured and immiserated the country.

And like him, Syria seems to be on the pathway to being born anew. And now, Syria has [relief](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-sign-order-related-syria-sanctions-easing-cbs-news-reports-2025-06-30/)
 from the sanctions that decimated its economy for so long.

But the line dividing the old and the new is not so easily made.

After Sharaa met US President Donald Trump during the American leader’s glitzy, made-for-TV tour of the Gulf, he took to national television to celebrate Trump’s verbal promise to lift sanctions but also to underscore the hurdles facing the transition.

“The window of hope overlooks and supervises a promising future. A host of other investors are practically [salivating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/too-good-be-true-investors-eye-syria-after-trump-sanctions-move-2025-05-14/)
 to bring money back into the country.

Sharaa enjoyed a lavish Gulf tour, “living his best life,” as some commentators [noted](https://x.com/ragipsoylu/status/1929128687913390571?s=46&t=jkJlaUvTKeCtY4AcNtnlqQ)
.

In the high of the moment, and after repeated encounters with the Americans and mixed signals from the Israelis, Sharaa misread the messages and thought he was greenlit to take control of all of Suwayda, the city tucked away in the country’s south with a population predominantly made up of Druze, according to multiple sources.

And thus in just a few weeks’ time, Sharaa’s high of highs came crashing back to the earth.

On July 11, [clashes](https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%84-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7/769601/)

[Careful footwork: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a joint press conference for Israeli President Isaac Herzog's state visit to Ankara, Turkey, on March 9, 2022. This could intensify competition across overlapping spheres of influence – from Syria and Iraq to the Eastern Mediterranean and the South Caucasus.

The characterisation of Turkey as the principal beneficiary of the recent Iran-Israel conflict – emerging unscathed while its two regional rivals engaged in direct confrontation – oversimplifies the pressures facing Ankara’s foreign and security policy. Once close allies now appear to be on a collision course – but it is crucial to discern what is real, what is calibrated for domestic audiences, and how much of the current tension may ultimately prove impermanent.

The Current State of Bilateral Relations
----------------------------------------

Despite efforts to rehabilitate ties between Turkey and Israel following President Isaac Herzog’s [historic state visit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/middleeast/israel-isaac-herzog-turkey-visit.html)
 to Ankara in March 2022, relations nosedived as Israel’s military action in Gaza intensified following the horrific Hamas attacks on 7th October 2023, triggering a rising civilian death toll rose and a humanitarian catastrophe there.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the [harshest critics](https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-compare-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-adolf-hitler-unga/)
 of the current Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Domestically, Israeli military unilateralism is already emboldening Turkey’s own assertive defence posture, fuelling efforts to strengthen its indigenous military capabilities.

While Israel and Turkey diverge sharply in their visions for the region’s future security architecture, they share some objectives: limit the possibility of Iranian re-entrenchment in the region, particularly across Syria; and the refusal to tolerate hostile actors on their borders.

The Regional Alliance-Building Race
-----------------------------------

For Israel and Iran, the current pause seems to be an opportunity to reframe their post-war narratives and shore up regional allies as a form of strategic deterrence. Such complexity is testament to blurred lines, overlapping trade interests, and transactional diplomacy, a not so hidden receding of previous ‘us or them’ binaries.

The Kurdish Question in Turkey-Israel Ties
------------------------------------------

If tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate to military standoff, it will most likely spark in Syria. [Israel sees](https://www.inss.org.il/social_media/between-the-united-states-turkey-and-israel-insights-from-the-announcement-on-reducing-us-forces-in-syria/)
 diminished American troop presence in Syria as a win for Turkey, and a setback for Israel.

Israel’s support for the Kurds, a group seen as less hostile to Israel, has amplified since the overthrow of the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Rather than direct confrontation, a more imminent risk relates to a sub-threshold conflict or ‘grey zone’ activity between Turkey and Israel.

While the prospect of formal normalisation between Israel and either Lebanon or Syria remains highly improbable, the establishment of a functional non-aggression mechanism – particularly from the perspective of Damascus – could be transformative. This will inevitably call for a recalibration of the strategic triangle between Turkey, Israel, and Iran.

[Close](#) In this chaotic vacuum, Turkey and Israel have re-engaged, translating Syria’s power void into a contest of occupied sovereign space, masked by counterterrorism and humanitarian rhetoric.

**Competing foreign agendas**

In the shifting strategic landscape of post-Assad Syria, both countries have consolidated their positions in what many now refer to as Syria’s “second civil war”—a reconfiguration of violence in which domestic forces have become subordinate to competitive regional designs. Despite diverging styles and strategic end goals, Turkey and Israel have emerged as the leading external powers, influencing both territorial reconfigurations and institutional developments in Syria’s new order.

Ankara’s engagement is both pervasive and systematic. Turkish policy appears driven by three primary goals: to inhibit, through direct intervention, any consolidation of a Kurdish self-governing enclave along the southern border; to orchestrate the organized, albeit selective, return of Syrian refugees under a Turkish oversight apparatus; and, ultimately, to lay the foundations of a post-Assad settlement conforming to Ankara’s strategic calculus and its pan-Islamist conception of regional order.

Within these zones, Ankara has inserted substitutive governance networks, dispersing gendarmeries, judge panels and municipal advisory bodies that are underpinned by Turkish parliamentary appropriations. Accordingly, the reconfiguration of Syria’s political order will hinge as much upon these domestic actors as upon any external endeavor to impose change.

**Legacy actors recalibrate** 

Even as Turkey and Israel now dominate the foreign policy landscape in Syria, the influence of Russia and Iran—once the key players of the Assad regime—has not entirely disappeared from the equation. Turkey and Israel, for instance, impose authority over selected territories without openly claiming them; the resulting spheres of governance more closely resemble imperial protectorates than classical foreign military occupations, thereby reconstituting the region’s constitutional and geopolitical boundaries without invoking outright annexation.

**Conclusion: Controlled disintegration as doctrine**

If the Syrian model is reproduced, the region may enter an era in which weaker states function as laboratories for informal empire and diplomacy is replaced by strategic classification. The competing designs of Turkey and Israel point to a wider pattern, where formal sovereignty gives way to security imperatives and strategic influence is secured by proxies. 

What is clear, however, is that the Syrian crisis has entered a new chapter—defined not by revolution or counterrevolution, but by the slow, deliberate architecture of fragmentation.

Israel and Turkey have reached an agreement in principle aimed at preventing any unwanted incidents between both countries’ militaries operating in Syria, and established a hotline to avert such conflicts, according to media reports on Wednesday.

An Israeli official told the Israel Hayom daily that the deal was reached Wednesday, after over a [month of talks mediated by Azerbaijan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)
, a mutual ally of the two countries, which were confirmed by the Prime Minister’s Office last month.

A hotline will be used to avert clashes between Israel, which has troops in the south of the country, and Turkey, whose military is operating in the north of the country, two sources familiar with the issue told the [Middle East Eye](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-israel-establish-hotline-syria)
 news site.

Russia and Israel also [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 in 2015 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country, and Russia provided military support for the Bashar al-Assad regime amid the Syrian civil war.

A source familiar with the talks told the site that Jerusalem was generally at ease with Ankara’s deployment of its forces in Syria, with the main issue over where Turkey would deploy its air defenses and radars, which could scan for Israeli aerial activities. The negotiations are now “focusing on the so-called Palmyra line” — an area where Turkey sought to take over airbases.

Reuters reported last month that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria near Palmyra where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

“Those bases represent a gray zone; the Israelis could be amenable to Turkish deployments north of that area,” the source said.

Turkish military officials said they had nothing to announce on the matter.

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of Assad.

Following the fall of Assad, Israel has also carried out a campaign to destroy Syrian military capabilities so that they cannot threaten Israel. It fears that if Turkey establishes a military presence in Syria, it could hamper the Israeli Air Force’s freedom of action in the region.

Israel also moved troops into the Syrian side of the two countries’ demilitarized buffer zone, citing fear that it would fall into the wrong hands.

Meanwhile, Israel has been [holding secret talks](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-israel-holding-talks-with-syria-on-sharaa-regime-joining-abraham-accords/)
 with Syrian officials, including on the possibility of the new regime joining the Abraham Accords, according to a report released last week, a day after US President Donald Trump invited new Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to join the accords and normalize ties with Israel.

[![Troops of the 810th "Mountains" Regional Brigade operate in southern Syria, in a handout photo issued on May 5, 2025. Israel is wary of the Islamist presence on its border and has lobbied the United States to curb Turkey’s growing influence in the country.

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is an avowed supporter of Hamas and one of the leading critics of Israel on the world stage, and his country has frequently praised the Iran-backed Palestinian terror group’s October 7, 2023, attack that started the ongoing war, when thousands of terrorists invaded southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

## Elaboration

Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

RUSI ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)) discusses the relationship between Turkey and Israel, including their involvement in Syria, and mentions technical talks between the two sides to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March. <image:1>, <image:2> The article also mentions that in March 2022, the Turkish President attended a joint press conference for the Israeli President's state visit to Ankara.


### Evidence from `web_search`
A Wikipedia page details the Israeli invasion of Syria, including events in 2025 such as the March Daraa clashes and Southern Syria clashes. The page also mentions foreign involvement and reactions from various countries and organizations ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

An article in The Armenian Weekly discusses Syria's second civil war and mentions Turkish military intervention in March 2025 (<image:k>) ([https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Syria’s interim government has requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat “terrorist organizations,” including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria’s defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

“As long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,” Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

“The heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey’s national security,” he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey’s national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be “following” the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria’s interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria’s national army."

Two recent developments present the new Syrian government with a critical opportunity to stabilize the country. A central focus of Israeli operations is Turkey’s growing role in Syria. Israeli officials [increasingly view](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkish-backed-syria-bigger-threat-iran-says-israeli-govt-panel)
 Ankara’s presence as a greater threat than Iran, and have [targeted](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 airbases Turkey aimed to control. His allies in the sector are now [eyeing lucrative reconstruction contracts](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/economy/2025/03/19/turkish-companies-set-to-play-key-role-in-syrias-reconstruction/)
 across the border — and backing Erdoğan’s push for Western sanctions relief and international funding to flow into post-war Syria.

Erdoğan is also seeking Kurdish support for his 2028 run — a prospect greatly aided by the PKK’s [May 12 announcement](https://apnews.com/article/turkey-kurdish-militants-disarm-9f4347a04cba48ceb509d2e82023a19e)
 that it would disband and renounce armed conflict as part of a new [peace initiative](https://apnews.com/article/turkey-pkk-ocalan-peace-talks-68decd55c35fa537f04b117bc9736128)
 with Turkey. Now, Erdoğan sees Syria’s new landscape as an opportunity for a reset — an opening to realign with the Trump administration and push for Turkey’s return to the F-35 project.

Ankara is betting that if the new Syrian government maintains stability, implements the agreement to integrate the SDF into the national army, and keeps up pressure on ISIS, President Trump will pull US troops from Syria — ending support for the SDF and removing a key source of friction in US-Turkey ties. But both Western and Gulf capitals remain wary of interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s [jihadi background](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html)
 and doubt that Erdoğan — himself an [increasingly authoritarian leader](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/turkey/turkey-now-full-blown-autocracy-erdogan-imamoglu)
 — can serve as a moderating force over Syria’s new government. Regional efforts are [underway](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/exclusive-uae-mediating-secret-talks-between-israel-and-syria-sources-say/ar-AA1EkiiL?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

### Evidence from `web_search`
A Wikipedia page details the Israeli invasion of Syria, including events in 2025 such as the March Daraa clashes and Southern Syria clashes. The page also mentions foreign involvement and reactions from various countries and organizations ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quick to respond to the attempted intimidation tactics of Erdoğan, declaring in its statement, “Israel completely rejects the statement of the Turkish president.” The ministry statement further added, “The aggressive imperialist actor in Syria (as well as in Northern Cyprus, Libya and other areas in the Middle East) is Turkey itself, and it is advisable for the Turkish president to avoid unnecessary threats. The State of Israel will continue to act to protect its borders from any threat.”

(March 28, 2025 / JNS)

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, is not a likable person. The severe blows Israel inflicted upon Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria provided the jihadists led by Ahmed al-Sharaa (the nom de guerre for Mohammad al-Julani), a path to victory over Assad’s forces.

According to an article published in the _Türkiye_ newspaper on March 17, “[Turkey will train](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/03/742137/Turkey-military-bases-Syria)
 the country’s army in two military bases it will establish in Syria.” The paper also reported that “Turkey and Syria will sign a joint defense agreement. The commission also declared that “Religious minorities in Turkey have expressed concerns that governmental rhetoric and policies contribute to an increasingly hostile environment and [implicitly encourage](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256675/how-difficult-is-it-to-be-a-christian-in-turkey-what-you-need-to-know)
 acts of societal aggression and violence.”

With his incompetent handling of the Turkish economy and his avoidance of the difficult tasks required to heal it, Erdoğan seeks “victories” in foreign affairs, including his meddling in Jerusalem’s management of Islamic holy sites. 

In September, for instance, Erdoğan accused Israel of targeting the Al-Aqsa Mosque as part of an expansionist Israeli drive. He also urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to convene an emergency summit to discuss the war in Gaza and accused Israel of attacks on Muslims in Jerusalem.  

The Trump administration must reconsider providing F-16 jet fighters to Turkey, as well its place in NATO. The United States must also protect the Kurds of northeastern Syria from repeated attacks by the Turkish armed forces. 

Under Erdoğan, Turkey is fighting the [Syrian Democratic Forces](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syria-sharaa-assad-damascus-aleppo-killed-violence-tartus-kurd-latakia-rcna195580)
, an ally of the United States, and threatening Israel, America’s only reliable ally in the Middle East. Powered by Salamandra

Turkey’s moves in Syria threaten Israel  
=========================================

It is time for the United States to address the excesses of Turkey’s president.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends a meeting at Vahdettin Palace in Istanbul on Jan. We must only be strong.”

Turkey’s president has escalated his attacks on Israel since the Oct. He has sought to incite the Sunni-Muslim world against Israel, and according to many in Israel, Erdoğan’s hostility toward Israel has reached a point where many in the Jewish state see a Sunni-Muslim crescent led by Erdoğan just as threatening as the Shiite-Muslim crescent led by Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei.

A Turkish military presence on Syrian territory could present a real threat to the State of Israel. 

The Trump administration must consider measures against the megalomaniacal Turkish leader, who is unreliable insofar as NATO is concerned. Erdoğan purchased Russian S-400 missiles designed to shoot down NATO planes, and Russia provided the Turkish armed forces with advanced weapons capable of covering most of Syria, as well as their old adversary, Greece (also a NATO member), in contravention of NATO rules.

Under Erdoğan, religious minorities in Turkey are also faring badly, according to the U.S. Photo by Rory Arnold/No10 Downing Street via Wikimedia Commons.](https://me.jnsi.org/uploads/2025/03/erdogan-1320x880.jpg "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends a meeting at Vahdettin Palace in Istanbul on Jan. Certainly not outside of Turkey, but also among a great many inside the country. Considered by many a megalomaniac who views himself as the caliph of the Sunni-Muslim world, he seeks to recreate the Ottoman Empire.

Some, like the jihadists who took over Syria with Erdoğan’s equipment, training and cash, look up to him. According to the agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, Ankara will help Syria if Damascus faces a sudden threat.”

_Türkiye_ also reported the government’s plan to have 50 Turkish Air Force F-16 jetfighters nest inside the new bases to support and protect the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from collapse until a new Syrian air force is established.

Erdoğan has far greater ambitions than simply training Syrian Sunni rebels.

The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported on a large-scale military mobilization by Turkish forces, along with an extensive deployment of mine engineering teams, in the villages of Mar’anaz, Al-Alqamiyah and Menagh in northern Syria.

Should Erdoğan deploy the F-16 jet fighters in Syria, it would threaten Israeli security and hinder Israeli preventive operations inside Syria.

Israel has established a temporary buffer zone on the Syrian slopes of Mount Hermon to protect its citizens in the Golan Heights from jihadist forces."

While the article does not explicitly state that Erdoğan urged the U.S. to control Israel, it does mention the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)).

This suggests that there were concerns about Turkey's actions and a call for U.S. involvement, although it's not a direct quote from Erdoğan. The PBS News article from July 2025 mentions the U.S. brokering a ceasefire, which implies U.S. involvement in the situation ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as there is evidence of Turkey's actions and calls for U.S. involvement, but the evidence does not directly confirm Erdoğan's specific request to the U.S. to control Israel.

RUSI ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)) discusses the relationship between Turkey and Israel, including their involvement in Syria, and mentions technical talks between the two sides to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March. <image:1>, <image:2> The article also mentions that in March 2022, the Turkish President attended a joint press conference for the Israeli President's state visit to Ankara.


### Evidence from `web_search`
A Wikipedia page details the Israeli invasion of Syria, including events in 2025 such as the March Daraa clashes and Southern Syria clashes. The page also mentions foreign involvement and reactions from various countries and organizations ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

An article in The Armenian Weekly discusses Syria's second civil war and mentions Turkish military intervention in March 2025 (<image:k>) ([https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)). The Times of Israel reports on an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria, including a photo of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shaking hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in February 2025 (<image:12811>) ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's actions in Syria and that there were calls for U.S. involvement. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While the JNS.org article mentions the author urging the U.S. to address Turkey's actions, it does not directly quote Erdoğan.

### Evidence from `web_search`
A Wikipedia page details the Israeli invasion of Syria, including events in 2025 such as the March Daraa clashes and Southern Syria clashes. The page also mentions foreign involvement and reactions from various countries and organizations ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

An article in The Armenian Weekly discusses Syria's second civil war and mentions Turkish military intervention in March 2025 (<image:k>) ([https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)). The Times of Israel reports on an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria, including a photo of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shaking hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in February 2025 (<image:12811>) ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

JNS.org ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)) published on March 28, 2025, discusses Turkey's actions in Syria and their implications for Israel, including President Erdoğan's actions and the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president. <image:13261>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides some support for the claim. The JNS.org article from March 28, 2025, discusses Turkey's actions in Syria and their implications for Israel, including President Erdoğan's actions. While the article does not explicitly state that Erdoğan urged the U.S. to control Israel, it does mention the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)).

This suggests that there were concerns about Turkey's actions and a call for U.S. involvement, although it's not a direct quote from Erdoğan. The PBS News article from July 2025 mentions the U.S. brokering a ceasefire, which implies U.S. involvement in the situation ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as there is evidence of Turkey's actions and calls for U.S. involvement, but the evidence does not directly confirm Erdoğan's specific request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Content: "In 2023, the two countries carried out $7bn in trade.

Ankara has not minced its words about Israel’s war on Gaza, with [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](/news/2025/2/28/erdogan-says-pkk-leaders-call-to-disband-a-historic-opportunity)
 calling it a genocide – like many other world leaders and leading human rights organistions – and likening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

“We have completely cut off our trade with Israel. We do not allow their planes to enter our airspace,” Fidan said.

The Turkish foreign minister’s condemnation comes amid years of increasingly tense relations between the two countries, said Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar.

“It’s not only about the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding in Gaza; Turkiye gradually is perceiving Israel as a national security threat,” Serdar explained, noting that Israel’s expansionism and attacks across the wider Middle East have been cause for concern.

In Syria particularly, Ankara has accused Israel of [wilfully undermining](/news/2025/8/13/turkiye-slams-israel-kurdish-led-sdf-for-destabilising-syria)
 the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the removal of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive.

“Diplomats in Ankara are seeing that if Israel is not stopped, eventually there might be a direct military confrontation between these two countries,” he said.

Serdar added that the Turkish foreign minister’s comments also show that Turkiye is looking to the Global South and other powers to take action, amid the United States’ and European Union’s largely unwavering support for Israel.

Turkish media reported last week that a ban on maritime traffic linked to Israel had been imposed, although there was no official statement. More and more countries and companies have decided to stop their business with Israel.”

Last November, Turkish authorities denied permission for Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane to enter Turkiye’s airspace for a trip to an international summit in Azerbaijan.

“As Turkiye, we have to take a stance on certain issues,” Erdogan later said when asked about the incident.

Israel and Turkiye’s relationship had soured as far back as 2010, following Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which killed 10 Turkish citizens.

More recently, a Turkish-American activist, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed by Israeli forces during a protest in the occupied West Bank in September 2024.

Turkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan giving a speech at the Grand National Assembly of Turkiye \[AFP\]

Published On 29 Aug 202529 Aug 2025

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and has closed its airspace to its aircraft, in protest over the war in Gaza.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Turkish parliament on [Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/8/29/live-israel-2)
 on Friday, Fidan said Israel has been “committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes”.

Turkiye cut off direct trade ties with Israel in May last year, demanding a permanent ceasefire and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to reports, Israeli vessels were banned from docking in Turkiye, and Turkish-flagged ships were not allowed to enter Israeli ports.

‘Like pariahs’
--------------

Meanwhile, Turkiye’s latest move is making “more and more Israelis feel the disadvantages of this kind of war that has no deadline”, said Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst.

“Turkiye is not just another country that is deciding to cut its relationship with Israel. We do not allow Turkish ships to go to Israeli ports. Turkiye has been an ally of Israel for many years, a very important market to Israeli goods,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, speaking from Kiryat Shmona, adding that it was also a favourite summer destination for many Israelis.

“We feel more and more … Israelis are feeling isolated and \[like\] pariahs."

Turkey’s president lashes out shortly after talks with Netanyahu’s government aimed at defusing tensions

The Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan)
 has lambasted Israel for undermining stability in neighbouring Syria during a diplomatic forum, days after the two countries held talks aimed at defusing an escalating conflict between them on Syrian soil.

“Turkey will not allow Syria to be dragged into a new vortex of instability,” Erdoğan told attendees at the Antalya diplomacy forum on the southern Turkish coast, accusing Israel of “trying to undermine the 8 December revolution”, in reference to the insurgency that [toppled the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/bashar-al-assad-reported-to-have-fled-syria-as-rebels-say-they-have-captured-damascus)
 after decades in power.

“We are in close dialogue and in common understanding with all influential actors in the region, especially Mr Trump and Mr Putin, regarding the preservation of Syria’s territorial integrity and stability,” he added.

Attendees at the forum included the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov as well as Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who met Erdoğan on the sidelines of the conference in Antalya.

The Turkish presidency said Erdoğan reiterated Ankara’s efforts to lift sanctions on Syria, and told Sharaa that [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey)
 “welcomes the fact that those who want chaos in Syria to occur again are not given an opportunity”.

Tensions between [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 and Turkey have grown since Assad’s overthrow, peaking after Israeli forces pounded three military bases across Syria with airstrikes earlier this month. Reuters reported that Turkish military teams had scoped out the main airport in Hama province as well as the T4 and Palmyra air bases in Homs, assessing the runways, hangars and infrastructure to see if forces and military hardware could be deployed there as part of a planned joint defence pact between Ankara and Damascus.

The defence minister Israel Katz called airstrikes “a clear message and warning for the future”.

[Israel has struck military sites in Syria hundreds of times](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation)
 since Assad fled to Moscow four months ago, destroying military assets including missile systems and air defences that the transitional government in Damascus had hoped to inherit.

Assad’s overthrow marked the end of over 50 years of dictatorial rule by his family, as well as a halt to a decade-long civil war that became a frozen proxy conflict. If Turkey comes in and begins installing air defence systems or introducing jets into Syrian airspace, that limits Israel’s freedom of action significantly,” said Aron Lund, an analyst with the New York thinktank Century International.

“For Turkey, the problem now is not just Israel objecting to their military presence but doing things that by design or default are weakening or preventing the emergence of a functioning government in Syria, such as saying the new Sharaa government can’t have forces south of Damascus,” he said.

Israeli military forces infiltrated a remote town in the Daraa countryside south of Damascus earlier this month, with Syrian state media saying nine civilians were killed in shelling during the deepest Israeli incursion into Syria.

Amid few signs that Israeli forces intend to leave the area around Mount Hermon, an Israeli tour company has [reportedly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/11/israeli-military-organises-tourist-tours-of-newly-occupied-syrian-territory)
 begun offering twice-daily hiking tours of the area in cooperation with troops stationed there.

Less than a week after Israel struck three airbases in Syria, the two sides held talks in Azerbaijan aimed at finding ways to defuse growing tensions in Syria. The former autocrat’s backers Russia and Iran faced off against forces supported by Ankara in northern Syria, and an American military presence in the east and south.

“Assad had Russia as his protector in the second half of the Syrian civil war. The office of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a delegation composed of top security and diplomatic officials met their Turkish counterparts, with the two sides agreeing “to continue on the path of dialogue in order to maintain regional stability.”

The Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told local broadcaster CNN Türk that “while we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia.”

Fidan added that technical teams from both sides are in contact “when needed”, in order “to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other”.

Lund labelled the talks “a very positive thing”, given the risk of a clash between the two powers in Syria, amid regional conflict including Israel’s 18-month assault on Gaza.

“They will be both be military involved in Syria, and this could spiral in a number of different ways. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

A Wikipedia page details the Israeli invasion of Syria, including events in 2025 such as the March Daraa clashes and Southern Syria clashes. The page also mentions foreign involvement and reactions from various countries and organizations ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

An article in The Armenian Weekly discusses Syria's second civil war and mentions Turkish military intervention in March 2025 (<image:k>) ([https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)). The Times of Israel reports on an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria, including a photo of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shaking hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in February 2025 (<image:12811>) ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

JNS.org ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)) published on March 28, 2025, discusses Turkey's actions in Syria and their implications for Israel, including President Erdoğan's actions and the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president. <image:13261>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides some support for the claim. The JNS.org article from March 28, 2025, discusses Turkey's actions in Syria and their implications for Israel, including President Erdoğan's actions. While the article does not explicitly state that Erdoğan urged the U.S. to control Israel, it does mention the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)).

This suggests that there were concerns about Turkey's actions and a call for U.S. involvement, although it's not a direct quote from Erdoğan. The PBS News article from July 2025 mentions the U.S. brokering a ceasefire, which implies U.S. involvement in the situation ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as there is evidence of Turkey's actions and calls for U.S. involvement, but the evidence does not directly confirm Erdoğan's specific request to the U.S. to control Israel.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that in March 2025, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made strong statements against Israel. Specifically, a JINSA report states that on March 30, 2025, Erdoğan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." The Guardian reported that Erdoğan lambasted Israel for undermining stability in Syria in April 2025. However, the evidence does not mention Erdoğan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The Times of Israel reports on an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria, including a photo of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shaking hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in February 2025 (<image:12811>) ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Turkish President was involved in discussions and actions related to Israel's involvement in Syria in 2025. Specifically, the evidence mentions: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)), technical talks between Turkey and Israel to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria after Israeli airstrikes in March ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)), and an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria in February 2025 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Turkish President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Turkish concerns and actions regarding Israel's involvement in Syria, the specific request to the U.S. is not mentioned.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. The information about the Turkish President urging the U.S. is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The PBS News article ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) from July 2025, reports on Syria's request for Turkish defense support due to sectarian violence and Israeli intervention, with the U.S. brokering a ceasefire in July. <image:13257> The Middle East Institute ([https://www.mei.edu/publications/trump-should-build-momentum-syria-and-help-prevent-turkey-israel-clash](https://www.mei.edu/publications/trump-should-build-momentum-syria-and-help-prevent-turkey-israel-clash/)) discusses the risk of a military confrontation between Turkey and Israel in Syria in May 2025. JNS.org ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)) published on March 28, 2025, discusses Turkey's actions in Syria and their implications for Israel, including President Erdoğan's actions and the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president. <image:13261>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides some support for the claim. The JNS.org article from March 28, 2025, discusses Turkey's actions in Syria and their implications for Israel, including President Erdoğan's actions. While the article does not explicitly state that Erdoğan urged the U.S. to control Israel, it does mention the author urging the United States to address the "excesses" of Turkey's president ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)).

This suggests that there were concerns about Turkey's actions and a call for U.S. involvement, although it's not a direct quote from Erdoğan. The PBS News article from July 2025 mentions the U.S. brokering a ceasefire, which implies U.S. involvement in the situation ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as there is evidence of Turkey's actions and calls for U.S. involvement, but the evidence does not directly confirm Erdoğan's specific request to the U.S. to control Israel.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The JINSA report from April 23, 2025, states that on March 30, 2025, President Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" (<image:k>). The Guardian published an article on April 12, 2025, stating that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan lambasted Israel for undermining stability in Syria (<image:13263>, <image:13264>). The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2025, reports that Turkey has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and closed its airspace to Israeli aircraft due to the war in Gaza (<image:13261>). The article does not mention President Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in March 2025, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made strong statements against Israel. Specifically, a JINSA report states that on March 30, 2025, Erdoğan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." The Guardian reported that Erdoğan lambasted Israel for undermining stability in Syria in April 2025. However, the evidence does not mention Erdoğan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

According to local media today, several individuals were killed and others injured during a clash with the Israeli army in western rural Daraa, southern Syria.

The SANA news agency stated that "at least 11 people were killed, and 27 others were injured," adding that Israeli forces withdrew after hours of incursion around the city of Nawa, the town of Al-Jubayliyah, and its dam in rural Daraa, retreating toward the Tel Ahmar base.

In this context, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said: "During the past night, forces from the 474th Golan Brigade operated in the Tasil area in southern Syria, seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure."

He added: "During the operation, several armed individuals opened fire at our forces operating in the area, prompting them to respond and eliminate several armed terrorists through ground and air strikes. The Israel Defense Forces will not allow a military threat inside Syria and will act against it."

The Israeli attack comes after airstrikes carried out by Israeli fighter jets during the night on the Scientific Research Center building in the Masaken Barzeh district of Damascus, as well as targeting Hama Military Airport and the Tiyas (T4) Airbase east of Homs.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Damascus authority stated in a statement that "the Israeli attack resulted in the near-total destruction of Hama Military Airport and the injury of dozens of civilians and military personnel."

Authorities in the southern province of Daraa said nine civilians were killed and several wounded in Israeli shelling near the city of Nawa.

The provincial government said the bombardment came amid Israel's deepest ground incursion into southern Syria so far.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the dead were local gunmen who were killed "while attempting to confront Israeli forces, following calls by the mosques in the area for jihad against the Israeli incursion".

According to the Israeli military, its forces were conducting operations in the Tasil area, near Nawa, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure" when "several gunmen fired at our forces".

They "responded by firing at them and eliminated several armed terrorists from the ground and from the air", a spokesperson said. The onslaught on military targets and in the southern province of Daraa killed at least 13 people.

Men check the scene of an Israeli strike in Syria's southern Hama governorate on April 3, 2025. There were no Israeli casualties.

"The IDF (military) will not allow the existence of a military threat in Syria and will act against it," the spokesperson added.

Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/benjamin-netanyahu/)
 demanded in February that southern Syria be completely demilitarised and said his government would not accept the presence of the forces of the new Islamist-led government near Israeli territory.

In December, Netanyahu ordered troops to enter the UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces along the 1974 armistice line on the [Golan Heights](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/golan-heights/)
.

'Unjustified escalation'
------------------------

On Wednesday, Israel hit targets across Syria including in the [Damascus](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/damascus/)
 area.

The Syrian foreign ministry said the strikes resulted in the "near-total destruction" of a military airport in the central province of Hama and wounded dozens of civilians and soldiers.

"This unjustified escalation is a deliberate attempt to destabilise Syria and exacerbate the suffering of its people," it said in a statement on Telegram.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz hit back with a warning to Sharaa in which he pointedly referred to the president by the nom de guerre he used as an Islamist rebel commander.

"I warn Syrian leader Jolani: If you allow hostile forces to enter Syria and threaten Israeli security interests, you will pay a heavy price," he said.

"The air force's activity yesterday near the airports in T4, Hama and the Damascus area sends a clear message and serves as a warning for the future," he added.

Read more[Israel strikes military targets in southern Syria over national security concerns](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250317-israel-southern-syria)

The Israeli military said its forces "struck military capabilities that remained at the Syrian bases of Hama and T4, along with additional remaining military infrastructure sites in the area of Damascus".

Israel has said it wants to prevent advanced weapons from falling into the hands of the new authorities, whom it considers jihadists.

Sharaa fought for Al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-led invasion of 2003 and later set up a Syrian branch of the jihadist network before breaking off all ties.

The Syrian ministry said the Israeli strikes came as the country was trying to rebuild after 14 years of war, calling it a strategy to "normalise violence within the country".

During a visit to [Jerusalem](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jerusalem/)
 last month, EU foreign policy chief [Kaja Kallas](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/kaja-kallas/)
 said that Israeli strikes on Syria were "unnecessary" and risked worsening the situation.

Syria accuses Israel of stoking a deadly destabilisation campaign
=================================================================

Middle East

Syria on Thursday condemned deadly Israeli strikes across the country as a "flagrant violation" of its sovereignty, after Israel said it struck "military capabilities". © Abdulaziz Ketaz, AFP

[Syria](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/syria/)
 accused [Israel](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/israel/)
 on Thursday of mounting a deadly destabilisation campaign after a wave of strikes hit military targets, including an airport, and ground incursions left 13 people dead. 

Israel said it responded to fire from gunmen during an operation in southern Syria and warned interim President [Ahmed al-Sharaa](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/abu-mohammed-al-jolani/)
 that he would face severe consequences if its security was threatened.

Israel has carried out an extensive bombing campaign against Syrian military assets since Islamist-led rebels toppled longtime strongman [Bashar al-Assad](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/bashar-al-assad/)
 in November."

Israeli tanks drive towards the occupied West Bank's Jenin refugee camp on February 23, 2025 \[Majdi Mohammed/AP\]

The Israeli military has launched several new raids across the occupied West Bank, intensifying a monthlong operation that has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands.

During the raids on Sunday and into Monday, [Israeli tanks](/news/2025/2/23/israel-expands-west-bank-offensive-says-troops-to-remain-for-next-year)
 were deployed in the occupied Palestinian territory for the first time in more than two decades.

Reports that the army is planning to open up military corridors in the West Bank suggested an extended and expanded campaign.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) raised alarm at the deteriorating situation, saying winter weather was making it more difficult for displaced Palestinians to survive.

“Many people have fled their homes to take shelter, including in crowded mosques and schools. The operation began shortly after a Gaza ceasefire deal came into effect on January 19.

Monday’s raids hit areas across the territory as bulldozers and armoured vehicles continued to pound the northern West Bank areas of Jenin and Tulkarem, where large refugee camps are located.

Soldiers were reported to have stormed Jenin from the west, besieging the refugee camp and the areas adjacent to it.

They also imposed a curfew in the town of Qabatiya, to the south of Jenin, for a second straight day and stormed the nearby towns of al-Yamoun and Burqin.

The al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, reported on Telegram that it was fighting with Israeli forces in Jenin.

“The Palestinians who have been forced from their homes in the occupied West Bank are going wherever they can – community centres, shelters, family and friends in nearby towns and villages, which are now also being under attack,” Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh reported.

Fear of greater escalation
--------------------------

Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, neighbouring Jordan and the Arab League called on Monday for a halt to the intensifying attacks.

Brazil also urged a full suspension of Israeli military attacks and unimpeded international aid access to the occupied territory.

The deployment of Israeli tanks in the West Bank is an ominous sign, Odeh said.

Reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel and the West Bank by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority, Odeh noted that Israeli media have cited sources close to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, outlining the army’s plans.

![Israel sends tanks into West Bank for first time in decades](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-23T181135Z_432697941_RC2F0DAUOJ9M_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-WEST-BANK-TANKS-1740382458.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Israel has been laying waste to Jenin for more than one month \[Raneen Sawafta/Reuters\]

“The Israeli media is quoting sources close to the prime minister saying that the army is intending to create large corridors in Tulkarem and Jenin – reminiscent of the so-called Netzarim Corridor in Gaza – in order to allow free movement for its forces and heavy equipment,” she said.

The Israeli-established and -occupied [Netzarim Corridor bisected Gaza](/news/2025/2/9/israeli-forces-withdraw-from-gazas-netzarim-corridor)
 and prevented displaced Palestinians from going back to their homes.

It is feared that a similar tactic in the West Bank would illustrate a plan to extend and expand the ongoing operation.

Hamas, which along with the Palestinian Authority condemned Israel for [assaults in the West Bank](/news/2025/2/19/israeli-armys-jenin-raid-enters-2nd-month-mass-displacement-in-west-bank)
, said Israel’s wish to stay there is “an illusion that will not come true”.

The Palestinian Authority called for urgent international intervention to “curb Israel’s unchecked aggression” and its effort to continue “genocide” against Palestinians.

More than 40,000 people have been displaced from Jenin and Tulkarem, including its Nur Shams refugee camp, by the ongoing Israeli operation.

Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz confirmed the number on Sunday, adding that the army intends to stay in the camps to prevent the return of residents.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday raised alarm about the Israeli attacks on the West Bank while warning against a return to fighting in Gaza.

“I am gravely concerned by the rising violence in the occupied West Bank by Israeli settlers and other violations as well as calls for annexation,” he said.

Israeli settlers, who are often backed by armed soldiers, carry out daily attacks in the occupied territory.

Videos released by Palestinian outlets from overnight into Monday showed settlers scrawling a Star of David and Hebrew graffiti on a Palestinian property and lighting a fire during an attack on farmland east of Yatta in the Hebron governorate.

The scale of destruction in the south of Lebanon has led some to accuse Israel of systematically targeting civilian infrastructure in the border area to complicate the return of displaced residents,[5](#footnote5 "Nazir Reza, ‘The Lebanese Army carried out 500 inspection and dismantling missions targeting Hezbollah installations south of the Litani River,’ Asharq Al-Awsat, 23 June 2025")

 Despite the extensive damage, hundreds of Lebanese returned to their villages as the ceasefire agreement’s 60-day deadline came to an end, including in areas where Israeli forces remained deployed. The designation could seriously jeopardize the Houthis’ finances and their ability to engage with international actors, which likely played a role in the group’s decision to de-escalate.[9](#footnote9 "Phil Stewart, ‘Trump designates Yemen’s Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organization,”’ Reuters, 23 January 2025")
 The Houthis used similar tactics in the past, often before the start of diplomatic talks to strengthen their bargaining position (for more [see this ACLED report](https://acleddata.com/2023/01/17/beyond-riyadh-houthi-cross-border-aerial-warfare-2015-2022/)

The Houthis began attacking ships in November 2023 in response to Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip and in purported solidarity with the Palestinian population.

Lebanon: Ceasefire deadline extended amid the IDF’s continued deployment in the south
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ceasefire that went into effect on 27 November between Lebanon and Israel continued to hold in December, despite occasional cross-border IDF attacks. Israel claimed it had targeted suspected individuals and Hezbollah operatives posing an “imminent threat” to troops operating in southern Lebanon.[7](#footnote7 "Emanuel Fabian, ‘22 killed in south Lebanon as IDF fires on suspects trying to break through to villages,’ Times of Israel, 26 January 2025")
 Between 26 and 31 January, after Israel secured an extension of the IDF withdrawal deadline until 18 February, ACLED records nearly 40 shooting attacks against civilians in at least 25 villages, primarily in the eastern sector. The ground operation has been stalled by the SNA and Turkish forces’ inability to take control of the strategic Tishrin Dam, which links the two areas and would allow ground forces to cross into the Ain al-Arab area.[10](#footnote10 "The New Arab, ‘280 dead as Turkey-backed SNA battle Kurdish-led SDF for control of Syria’s strategic Tishrin dam,’ 7 January 2025")
 Consequently, Turkish forces intensified their airstrikes on SDF-controlled areas in Aleppo governorate, with ACLED recording 93 airstrike events in January compared to 24 events in December 2024.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Israeli military forces were active in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, and the West Bank in February 2025. Specifically, there were reports of clashes and operations in Tasil in April 2025, and the IDF conducted operations in the West Bank, including Jenin and Tulkarm, during the same period. The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it mentions the presence of Israeli military forces in Tasil. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Israeli military entering Tasil in February 2025. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

Syria Weekly reported on June 4, 2025, about a rocket attack from southwestern Syria into Israeli territory, which led to Israeli retaliatory strikes in western Daraa, including areas near Tasil. ([https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation](https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation)) FRANCE 24 reported on April 3, 2025, about Israeli strikes in Syria, including operations in the Tasil area near Nawa, mentioning ground incursions and the seizure of weapons by Israeli forces. The article also mentions that in February, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the complete demilitarization of southern Syria.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the 2025 Israeli military operation in the West Bank, named "Iron Wall," which began on January 21, 2025. The operation's location is the West Bank, Palestine. The article mentions that the IDF has seized control of the Jenin, Nur Shams, and Tulkarm refugee camps. The article also mentions that the operation expanded to Tulkarm Governorate on January 27, 2025. The article also mentions that on March 10, 2025, PA forces killed the prominent Jenin Brigades militant Abdul Rahman Abu Al-Muna. The article also mentions that on March 12, 2025, a militant shot and injured an 18-year-old Israeli near the Ariel settlement.

Al Jazeera published an article on February 24, 2025, discussing the Israeli military's intensified raids in the occupied West Bank, including the deployment of tanks. <image:42> The raids, which began after a Gaza ceasefire on January 19, have resulted in displacement and casualties. The article mentions raids in Jenin and Tulkarem, and the use of tanks in the West Bank for the first time in decades. The ACLED report mentions that violence in the West Bank escalated in January 2025, with a 14% increase in incidents involving Israeli forces compared to December. The report also mentions that the ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel continued to hold in December, despite occasional cross-border IDF attacks. The IDF carried out major operations in Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas in the north. The report was published on February 2025.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli military forces were active in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, and the West Bank in February 2025. Specifically, there were reports of clashes and operations in Tasil in April 2025, and the IDF conducted operations in the West Bank, including Jenin and Tulkarm, during the same period. The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it mentions the presence of Israeli military forces in Tasil. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Israeli military entering Tasil in February 2025. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack
------

On October 19, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea was targeted by one of three drones, believed to have been launched from Lebanon. She reported that sirens had gone off around Caesarea only after the attack on Netanyahu's residence was confirmed.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:5540>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:5541>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson [commented](https://x.com/chaimlevinson/status/1847939700037697686)
 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to escalated fighting against Israel yesterday, following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by the Israeli military.

In a statement released yesterday morning, it announced "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy," which it said will be "elaborated upon" in the coming days.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Israel targets three hospitals in Gaza, says health ministry

The IDF is “besieging and directly targeting” three hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening to put them out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry said this morning.

It said the IDF was attacking the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital, and appealed to the international community to intervene "to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip."

According to the health ministry, hospital staff and at least 40 patients and wounded are trapped the Indonesian Hospital, as Israeli "artillery targeted the upper floors" of the hospital, as well as a group of displaced people in front of its gates.

The "heavy gunfire," towards the building and courtyards was "causing great panic among patients and medical staff," the health ministry said.

In a statement, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was "no intentional fire directed at it."

A “Palestinian terrorist” attempted to drive a car at a police vehicle at the entrance to the Ofra settlement in the Israeli occupied West Bank, the IDF said this morning.

It said the driver of the vehicle was killed and that no Israeli soldiers were injured.

The IDF added that the incident was under review.

A drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the town of Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces said a drone crossing from Lebanon “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” while Israeli news outlet Ynet reported the sound of an explosion in the town.

The attack comes just days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF, but the latest strikes have provided a quick reality to check for any hopes his death could spell an end to the conflict.

At least 55 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel in the space of an hour on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the latest wave of missiles, including in the port city of Haifa which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks.

NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding non-stop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

Dramatic footage released by the Israeli military that purport to show Yahya Sinwar’s final moments will be etched in the Palestinian national memory for generations to come: the defiance of Sinwar, covered in dust and with his right arm blown off, yet still fighting.

It’s an image that brings to mind an uncomfortable comparison to Israel’s national hero Joseph Trumpeldor, the one-armed Zionist resistance fighter.

![Image:](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241019-sinwar-still-aa-f93d1a.jpg)

A video still of Sinwar in his final moments, released by the IDF. For them, this was a military commander fighting to the last, willing to sacrifice not only the lives of thousands of Israelis and tens of thousands of Palestinians — but also his own.

Reporting from Aitou, Lebanon

The scene of carnage in [northern Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/lebanon)
 showed heartbreaking snippets of everyday family life.

A dead baby inside a destroyed pickup truck; a child’s severed arm buried in nearby rubble; toddler clothing and books shredded; flies swarming as officials collected body parts, some too small for body bags ending up in clear ziplock bags.

Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials.

This was the aftermath of an airstrike Monday on the Lebanese Christian village of Aitou that Israel said had targeted a position held by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

Until then, this region of hilly olive groves and winding, sea-view roads had been a relative haven, one that felt far away from the war dominating Beirut and the country’s south.

Just last week, the area “was calm; everything was quiet,” Illy Edwan told NBC News as he surveyed the wreckage of his villa, which was reduced to rubble in the blast, its insulation and inner structure ripped to pieces, an adjacent vehicle twisted open like a burnt pretzel.

“My house used to be three-story, but look at it today,” he added.

Hundreds are dead and thousands more have been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as the IDF deepens its offensive in the area and sends more troops to fight.

The IDF laid siege to the camp 15 days ago, surrounding it with tanks while raining down artillery fire. Another person is in moderate condition after they were injured by shrapnel near the commercial center in Ein Hafaretz.

Air strikes have hit a suburb in Lebanon's capital Beirut this afternoon, less than an hour after the IDF ordered residents to evacuate the area.

Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said that a building in Haret Hreik was struck twice, and a plume of smoke was also seen rising from the area.

IDF spokesperson Avicahy Adraee had earlier given evacuation orders for the area.

Adraee issued multiple evacuation warnings today to residents in parts of southern Beirut, warning of future military operations in the area.

Spokesperson Avichay Adraee also ordered residents located in Choueifet Al-Umara and Borj El Brajneh to leave, saying they were "near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah," and urged people to evacuate.

Two patients have died inside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza due to Israel's siege on the area, according to the local health ministry.

It said the patients died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and lack of medical supplies."

In a statement earlier today, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was “no intentional fire directed at it.”

The war in Gaza "continues unabated," Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian relief said, days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, raising a fleeting hope it could bring an end to the war.

At least 20,000 people had been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as Israel deepens its offensive in the region, Lazzarini said, and there are shortages of the most basic needs, like food, water and blankets."

Two more drones that crossed into Israeli territory were intercepted, the military said.

There were no casualties reported, according to the Israeli ambulance service and police said explosions had been heard in Caesarea, coastal town where Netanyahu has a holiday home.

The drone attack was not immediately claimed by the Lebanese Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel since last October, or any other militant group.

The two other drones were intercepted, the Israeli military said, adding that more than 100 rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanon, killing one person and injuring at least 13.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Iran-aligned Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel since October last year. Sirens were activated across northern Israel, including in the cities of Galilee and Haifa, she said.

Haifa is the largest city in northern Israel and is seen as a strategic port city that is home to 300,000 people and the country’s naval headquarters.

“The sirens went off just right after we got confirmation that a drone attack actually succeeded in targeting and striking the house of the Israeli prime minister in Caesarea,” Odeh said.

Israeli strikes
---------------

Later on Saturday, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health reported that four people were killed and 13 wounded in an Israeli air strike on an apartment building in the eastern town of Baaloul in the Western Bekaa district.

Israeli air strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanese state media said, marking the first attacks in three days on the area.

Footage from the news agency AFP showed plumes of smoke rising over the area, less than an hour after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order to its residents.

Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported two Israeli strikes on one building in the neighbourhood of Haret Hreik and later added that Israeli warplanes had struck the al-Umara neighbourhood in nearby Choueifat.

Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah targets.

On September 23, Israel launched an intense air campaign on Lebanon and later sent in ground forces after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with Hezbollah over the Gaza war.

At least 2,448 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon since October 2023, according to Lebanese health authorities.

aj-logo The attacks on Saturday came a day after the group announced a new phase in the fighting.

Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for the Caesarea drone attack but said it carried out several rocket attacks on northern and central Israel.

Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said the drone attack would raise concerns among Israeli security authorities.

“The fact that a drone was able to go undetected 70km \[43 miles\] from the Lebanese border – no sirens went off, and it struck the intended target – that has caused a lot of concern in Israel and in the Israeli security establishment.”

She said “a large volley of rockets” from Lebanon were used as decoys to launch the drone attack on Netanyahu’s house."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms a drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by multiple sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel)). However, the evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries.

The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.

The claim is missing information about Yair Netanyahu's presence or involvement in the attack.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms a drone attack on October 19, 2024, on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack. The evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While multiple sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel)) confirm a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on that date, the reports state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [Witnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo)
    
*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:2128>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

Content: "One man said he woke to "screaming and panic" and watched as "the flames spread rapidly from one tent to another".

Israel has told Palestinians to evacuate from other parts of Gaza to al-Mawasi.

The Israeli military said on Friday that it struck a "Hamas terrorist" in the area and that the incident was under review.

UN children's agency Unicef's executive director Catherine Russell said on Thursday: "Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core."

Meanwhile, Hamas formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire proposal, saying it was ready to negotiate a deal that would see the release of all 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, in return for an end to the war.

Israel had offered a 45-day ceasefire in return for the release of 10 hostages.

In a video statement, the head of Hamas's negotiating team Khalil al-Hayya said the group would not "accept partial deals that serve \[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\] Netanyahu's political agenda".

Israel's stated aim is the complete disarmament and destruction of Hamas.

In response to Hayya's remarks, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Bezalel Smotrich said it was time "to open the gates of hell on Hamas".

Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said two missiles hit tents in the coastal al-Mawasi area, near the southern city of Khan Younis, on Wednesday night, killing at least 16 people, "most of them women and children". <image:13290>!Getty Images A child in a pink hoodie stands amid the destruction after an Israeli strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians <image:13291>Getty Images

Witnesses told the BBC that flames spread rapidly between tents, causing dozens of deaths, including those of children

At least 37 people have been killed in a series of Israeli strikes in Gaza, most in areas where displaced civilians have set up tents, the Hamas-run civil defence agency says.

Witnesses in al-Mawasi told the BBC that tents were engulfed in flames on Wednesday night, following a "powerful" explosion, causing the deaths of dozens of Palestinians including children. "The fire was too intense, consuming the tents and the people inside. When the tents were targeted and caught on fire we received the patients. It claims there is no shortage of aid because 25,000 lorry loads of supplies entered during the ceasefire.

The war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas carried out a cross-border attack on Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's military campaign against Hamas has killed at least 51,065 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

! He said 23 others were wounded.

Video verified by the BBC showed the charred remnants of the camp with belongings strewn across the ground and survivors surveying the damage.

Survivors described waking to the "sound of screaming and panic" after a "powerful" explosion hit the encampment.

"I rushed outside and saw the tent next to mine engulfed in flames," a man told the BBC's Gaza Lifeline programme.

"Women were running out, trying desperately to escape the fire," he continued.

"Many martyrs were lost in the fire and we were helpless to save them. It was heartbreaking to watch them die right in front of us, unable to do anything as the flames spread rapidly from one tent to another."

He said that a "large number" of children had died.

A displaced woman from Khan Younis said that the strike had killed 10 members of one family while they were sleeping, with another five family members injured.

A man described rushing to the scene with others after hearing the explosion and attempting to extinguish the flames by throwing sand on the tents.

"But we failed," he said. Most of them are actually dead and arrive dead but we have some very critical patients," she told the BBC.

On Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it had "struck a Hamas terrorist in the area of Khan Younis" after taking steps to mitigate harm to civilians.

"The IDF is aware of the claim that as a result of the strike several uninvolved civilians were harmed. It said steps had been taken to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians.

At least four people have been killed and dozens of others wounded in an Israeli air attack on a hospital complex in central Gaza where displaced Palestinians sought shelter from Israel’s assault on the besieged territory.

The attack in the early hours of Monday struck the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital complex in Deir el-Balah and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp.

Videos shared on social media showed rescuers scrambling to save people as they struggled to contain the fire.

Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the air force carried out an attack on a “command and control centre” used by the Palestinian armed group Hamas, without providing evidence.

Israeli forces have regularly attacked medical facilities in Gaza since the assault began more than a year ago. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.

Gaza’s Media Office said it was the seventh time this year that Israel has hit the grounds of Al-Aqsa Hospital and the third in the past couple of weeks, killing Palestinians who were forced to flee their homes.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said more than 20 tents were destroyed in the attack.

“There were many people inside the tents as the fire spread, who could not be saved,” he said. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent sites, alleging armed groups were using them.

“What happened was that we woke up to smoke, flames, fire and burning pieces falling on the tents from every direction. The explosions terrified us in our tents and outside where we live behind Al-Aqsa Hospital,” Om Ahmad Radi, a survivor at the scene, told Al Jazeera.

“The fire trucks couldn’t get here. We witnessed one of the most horrible and brutal nights.”

Volunteer surgeon Mohammad Tahir said they were dealing with victims with burns on 60 to 80 percent of their bodies – many of whom won’t survive.

“Patients with significant high percentage burns – unfortunately, their fate is sealed. “We are looking at a large number \[of deaths\] as these tents are close to each other, back-to-back, and set up in a small space inside the hospital courtyard.”

The attack on Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital comes after at least 22 people were killed and 80 others wounded late on Sunday when Israeli tanks shelled a school sheltering the displaced in Nuseirat, also in central Gaza.

Israel’s assault on Gaza has destroyed large areas of the territory and displaced about 90 percent of its population of 2.3 million people, with many being uprooted repeatedly.

Israeli air and ground forces [have laid a siege on Jabalia](/news/2024/10/13/palestines-un-envoy-says-genocide-within-genocide-going-on-in-north-gaza)
 in northern Gaza for days, claiming Hamas fighters have regrouped there. The amount of fire and explosions was enormous. Over the past year, Israeli troops have repeatedly returned to the refugee camp in Jabalia, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.

The attack on Jabalia follows Israeli orders to fully evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City."

Dozens seriously injured as fire engulfs tents used by Palestinian journalists in hospital complex in Khan Younis

An Israeli airstrike on a tent camp within a hospital complex in the southern [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 city of Khan Younis has killed 10 people, including a journalist, while seriously injuring dozens more after their encampment caught fire.

Images and video from the courtyard of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis showed people desperately attempting to extinguish the fires as it burned through a row of tents. Israel’s assault on Gaza claimed the lives of 82 Palestinian journalists in 2024, according to CPJ.

The Palestinian foreign ministry in Ramallah said 10 people had been killed in the airstrike, with many more wounded. He said that the noise of the airstrike had woken them, only for them to see that a nearby tent sheltering their colleagues was on fire.

Since the beginning of Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip hundreds of people have sought shelter in encampments in hospital grounds across the besieged territory, hoping that proximity will provide a measure of safety.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security agency said the airstrike on the hospital grounds was targeting Aslih, whom they accused of being a member of Hamas.

----------- The ministry called al-Faqawi’s death an act of “extrajudicial killing,” labelling it part of growing crimes against journalists and an attempt to prevent the media from covering events on the ground.

Dozens of journalists in Gaza joined al-Faqawi’s relatives to bury the slain reporter in the hours after the attack, placing a blue flak jacket on top of the white shroud covering his body on a stretcher. Aslih has documented the impact of Israeli attacks on Gaza by uploading photos and video to his Instagram page, followed by 571,000 people.

His most recent post showed the funeral of the journalist Islam Miqdad, her blue flak jacket also draped across the white shroud over her body, in a burial ritual for journalists. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees said another 142,000 people were displaced in just six days in March after the resumption of fighting.

Fifty-nine hostages, including 24 understood to be alive, are still held by militants in Gaza."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:46>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:46>

## Elaboration
The reverse image search did not yield any results. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim. I need more information to determine the image's origin and context.


## Actions
```
web_search("Iranian strikes against Israel October 1 2024")
web_search("fire tents Israel")
image_search("fire tents")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. NPR's article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) mentions a ground offensive by Israel in Lebanon and includes images of the conflict <image:2128>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC reported on Israeli strikes in Gaza, specifically in the al-Mawasi area, where tents housing displaced Palestinians were hit, resulting in casualties. The article was published on April 18, 2025, and includes images of the aftermath of the attack. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrl891j23o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrl891j23o)) <image:13290>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were indeed Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that there were also incidents involving tents and fire in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, the provided image search did not yield any results. The BBC article from April 18, 2025, describes a fire in tents in Gaza.

Based on the available information, I cannot confirm that the image depicts tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image's origin and context remain unverified.

The article was published on April 18, 2025, and includes images of the aftermath of the attack. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrl891j23o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrl891j23o)) <image:13290>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were indeed Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that there were also incidents involving tents and fire in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, the provided image search did not yield any results. The BBC article from April 18, 2025, describes a fire in tents in Gaza.

Based on the available information, I cannot confirm that the image depicts tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image's origin and context remain unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian reported on an Israeli airstrike on a tent camp within a hospital complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, on April 7, 2025, which resulted in casualties and included an image <image:13297>

NBC News published an article about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, which includes an image of tents on fire <image:13331>

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there were incidents involving tents on fire in Gaza in April 2025, specifically due to Israeli airstrikes. However, the claim states the image depicts events from October 1, 2024, related to Iranian strikes against Israel. The image search did not yield any results. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

**The World Health Organisation has delivered 32 tons of medical supplies to [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 in anticipation of a potential full-scale conflict in the Middle East.**

“The goal is to get these supplies and medicines to various hospitals and to the health sector in Lebanon, especially in the places most exposed \[to hostilities\] so that we can be ready to deal with any emergency,” said Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad.

Last week, the Israeli military killed a senior commander of Lebanese militant group [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, sparking fears of a wider regional war.

Thousands of people are leaving Lebanon with the British government advising its citizens to flee the country “while commercial routes are still available”.

**The Israeli defence secretary, Yoav Gallant, met with US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin overnight to discuss Israel’s preparation for an expected Iranian retaliatory attack.**

The president of [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran)
, Masoud Pezeshkian, has said the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was a “major mistake by the Zionist regime \[Israel\] that will not go unanswered”.

According to a statement from the Israeli defence secretary’s team, Gallant briefed Austin on the “security developments in the region and IDF readiness to defend Israel against potential threats posed by Iran and its proxies”.

“He \[Gallant\] discussed a series of scenarios and corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities” and “expressed his appreciation to Secretary Austin for the close military and strategic coordination between Israel and the United States, including the current and future deployment of US military capabilities and force posture changes in defence of Israel”.

Gallant also stressed the importance of “US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Israel and the region from a range of aerial attacks”.

**Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said it is “justified and moral” to let two million civilians in Gaza die of hunger unless Israeli hostages are returned****.**

Speaking at a press conference in Israel, Smotrich complained that international pressure meant the government had “no choice” but to bring in aid.

The far-right politician argued that the main factor extending the war was aid sustaining Hamas, and that the Israeli government must regain full control over what enters [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
. “No one has the right to doubt Iran’s legal right to punish the Zionist regime,” said Kanaani.
    
*   **Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said it is “justified and moral” to let two million civilians in Gaza die of hunger unless Israeli hostages are returned****.** Speaking at a press conference in Israel, Smotrich complained that international pressure meant the government had “no choice” but to bring in aid.
    
*   **Nearly half of Hamas’ military battalions in Gaza have revived some of their fighting capabilities, according to a [CNN special report](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/)
    , despite Netanyahu’s claims that Israeli forces are near their intended goal of eliminating Hamas.** Speaking to Congress on 24 July, Netanyahu said, “Victory is in sight.” But analyses by the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project, the Institute for the Study of War and CNN show that despite the heavy bombardment of the Strip at least eight battalions remain combat effective.
    
*   **Israel has handed over 80 unidentified Palestinian bodies to the Gaza’s civil defence agency, according to Gazan officials.** Gaza’s civil defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman told AFP that no information was provided with the bodies, and so there is no clear idea where they came from.

!Yemenis wave flags and lift placards of Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Sana’a. The Israeli military says the attack wounded two soldiers and set off a fire.

The violence came amid fears of an all-out war after the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 and Hamas’s political leader in Iran.

The Hezbollah attack appears more in keeping with ongoing border skirmishes, rather than as a direct response to the political assassinations.

The Israeli military said fire services were working to put out a fire that was ignited as a result of the attack in Ayelet HaShahar in the upper Galilee.

The violence came amid fears of an all-out war after the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 and Hamas’s political leader in Iran.

The Hezbollah attack appears more in keeping with ongoing border skirmishes, rather than as a direct response to the political assassinations.

The Israeli military said fire services were working to put out a fire that was ignited as a result of the attack in Ayelet HaShahar in the upper Galilee.

US President **Joe Biden** will meet his national security team to discuss the situation in the Middle East on Monday, the White House has said, as fears grow that Iran will strike [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)

The US has said it will defend Israel in the event of an attack and moved warships and fighter jets to the region; it has also embarked on another round of frantic diplomacy aimed at deescalating tensions that were inflamed last week after Haniyeh’s killing and that of a senior [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 commander in Beirut.

Israel, which claimed responsibility for the Beirut attack, has not admitted any involvement in Haniyeh’s assassination although it is widely believed to be behind it.

“The overall goal is to turn the temperature down in the region, deter and defend against those attacks, and avoid regional conflict,” **Jonathan Finer**, the White House’s deputy national security adviser, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” programme on Sunday.

The US and Israel are preparing for every possibility, Finer added.

*   Israel says pre-emptive strikes in Lebanon stopped bigger attack
*   Hezbollah says attack has been completed, denies plans thwarted by Israeli strikes

JERUSALEM/BEIRUT, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel's military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. whoever harms us - we harm him".

The two sides have exchanged messages that neither wants to escalate further, with the main gist being that the exchange was "done", two diplomats told Reuters.

Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/world/middle-east/israel-promises-hit-hezbollah-hard-after-rocket-kills-12-football-field-2024-07-28/)
 last month killed 12 youths and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response.

Hezbollah had delayed its retaliation to give time for ceasefire talks, and had calibrated its attack to avoid triggering a full-scale war, a Hezbollah official said.

U.S. Netanyahu said these "pre-emptive" strikes had foiled a much larger Hezbollah barrage but Nasrallah said they had had little impact.

With three deaths confirmed in Lebanon and one in Israel, both sides indicated they were happy to avoid further escalation for now, but warned that there could be more strikes to come.

 leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian-backed group's barrage, a reprisal for the assassination of senior commander Fuad Shukr last month, had been completed "as planned".

However, the group would assess the impact of its strikes and "if the result is not enough, then we retain the right to respond another time", he said.

Israel's foreign minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned: "This is not the end of the story."

Earlier, Netanyahu had said: "We are determined to do everything we can to defend our country ... Brown arrived in Israel for talks with military leaders.

Meanwhile in Gaza, the Israeli offensive continued, with air strikes killing at least five Palestinians in Gaza City early on Monday, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.

A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the country's south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October.

Hezbollah said the strikes killed two of its fighters in al-Tiri. The Hezbollah-allied Shi'ite Muslim group Amal said a strike on Khiam killed one of its fighters.

“I don’t think Iran wants to find itself in escalation, especially when the US presence in the region is (now) in staggering numbers,” he said, adding this is indicative of de-escalatory efforts.

The Iranian government is yet to react to the cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah, something Citrinowicz said suggested Iran was willing to distance itself from Hezbollah’s attack amid the negotiations in Cairo.

Following the strikes, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant declared a “‘special situation on the home front’ across the country,” which enables the Israeli military to issue instructions to citizens, “including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant.”

﻿US President Joe Biden is closely monitoring events in Israel and Lebanon, the White House said Saturday night.

Netanyahu speaks following Israel's wave of 'preemptive' strikes against Hezbollah

03:44

Tel Aviv, Israel CNN  — 

The Israeli military launched what it called “preemptive” strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon, as the Iran-backed militant group said it carried out its own attacks in response to the killing of a top commander.

The overnight strikes are some of the most serious yet between Israel and Hezbollah, who have been exchanging fire for months. It followed these up with further attacks later in the day.

Israel said it carried out the strikes in self-defense after identifying that Hezbollah was “preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.” Hezbollah called Israel’s description of its strike as preemptive “baseless.”

“We removed a wider threat, probably also a future threat in some areas,” IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Sunday.

Soon after the Israeli raids, the IDF said approximately 200 rockets had been launched from Lebanon towards Israel early Sunday, with no reports of injuries so far. Hezbollah said the “first phase” of its strikes against Israel “ended with complete success,” claiming that it launched 320 rockets and a barrage of drones toward Israel.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech later on Sunday that the group’s attack on Israel was “meticulously” completed but further strikes could be carried out.

Hezbollah said it carried out strikes towards Israel in response to the killing of top military commander [Fu’ad Shukr](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/fuad-shukr-israel-strike-hezbollah-analysis-intl-latam/index.html)
 last month in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military intercepted “all of the drones that Hezbollah launched to a strategic target in the center of the country,” without clarifying what the target was.

Netanyahu added that “what happened today is not the end,” and that Nasrallah in Beirut and Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in Tehran “should know that this was another step on our way to change the situation in the north and safely return our residents to their homes.”

One Israeli soldier, 21-year-old David Moshe Ben Shitrit of the Israeli Navy, was killed in the fighting. The Hezbollah-allied Shia group Amal movement also said one of its fighters, was killed in Khiyam, but it is unclear if they are the same person.

For the Lebanese group, Shukr’s assassination was a change in the rules of engagement, Danny Citrinowicz, research fellow in the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said. “They had to retaliate,” Citrinowicz told CNN, adding that the group may have been trying to “draw a line in the sand” to avoid further attacks.

“The question was not if but when,” he said, adding that it is yet to be seen whether the group will be content with its attack or whether more projectiles will follow in the coming days.

Ceasefire talks resume despite strikes
--------------------------------------

The attacks took place just hours before mediation talks resumed in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which aim to strike a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas.

An Israeli official told CNN on Sunday afternoon that Israeli negotiators arrived in Cairo for ceasefire and hostage release negotiations.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 100 of its fighter jets “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels” across dozens of launch sites from Lebanon on Sunday. He and two others were injured “either directly from an Iron Dome interceptor or from falling shrapnel from the interceptor that accidentally hit a Dvora-class fast patrol boat after intercepting a UAV,” an army official told CNN.

Two people were killed in Israeli strikes on the village of At Tiri in Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon, Lebanese health officals said, and a third was killed when a car was hit in the town of Khiyam. Hezbollah also acknowledged the death of seven fighters on Friday but did not specify where or when they were killed. A brief restriction on gatherings in northern Israel has also lifted, except for the immediate border area with Lebanon and some settlements in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

Police said they thwarted several attempts to block roads by locating more stockpiles of tires that protesters were planning to burn.

“Lighting fires in public areas or on roads is not a form of protest, but a dangerous and criminal act that could endanger human life,” police said.

Although Israeli police said any disruptions have been intermittent, the widespread nature of the protests have caused traffic to build up across the country, in what protesters have called the “day of struggle.”

Ami Dror speaks to CNN on Tuesday, August 26.

CNN

A leader of the nationwide “day of struggle” protests, and former bodyguard to Israel’s prime minister, says Benjamin Netanyahu is waging a “political war,” and demanded an immediate end of hostilities and the release of all the hostages.

“The main goal of this war is to keep Netanyahu in his office,” Ami Dror said in an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson. His Bedouin village of Jabal al-Baba sits near the geographical center of the occupied West Bank, balanced between the north and south of what a future Palestinian state would be made up of.

But with each passing day, that dream seems to fade into the horizon, farther than ever before.

Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich last week announced the final approval of thousands of new housing units to expand Israel’s Ma’ale Adumim settlement, that would effectively cut the [West Bank in two](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/middleeast/settlement-plan-israel-palestinian-state-intl)
 – a plan known as E1.

Smotrich made it clear that his goal was to kill prospects of a Palestinian state, saying, “The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans, but with actions.”

Organizers in Israel estimated that hundreds of thousands attended their rally in Tel Aviv as a nationwide “day of struggle” for a hostage deal and ceasefire ended on Tuesday.

Images from Tel Aviv showed the streets packed with flag-waving demonstrators.

“The people of Israel are voting with their feet,” said Noam Peri, whose father was killed in captivity in Gaza, according to the organizer’s statement. “It’s the opposite of reunification, it’s the opposite of an opportunity to end this terrible and long nightmare.”

French President Emmanuel Macron has pushed back against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s accusation that he was fueling antisemitism in France by pledging to recognize a Palestinian state.

In a letter addressed to Netanyahu and made public on Tuesday, Macron listed many of the actions he has taken to fight antisemitism, saying allegations of inaction were “unacceptable and offend the whole of France.”

Macron was responding to a [letter that Netanyahu sent him](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-diplomatic-attacks-palestinian-statehood-intl)
 earlier this month, which read in part: “Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on this antisemitic fire. Instead, he argued, the move would pave the way to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

Macron also criticized Israel’s imminent takeover and occupation of Gaza City, as well as other actions Netanyahu’s government is taking against Palestinians.

The president concluded his letter by urging Netanyahu to abandon what he called a “deadly and illegal headlong rush into a permanent war in Gaza.”

Macron said he made his letter public because Netanyahu had done the same with his own letter.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)’s delegation in Israel and the occupied territories has called the strikes at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital “unacceptable” in a statement on X.

“It is crucial to guarantee its continued operation and accessibility for both medical personnel and patients,” the statement added.

The ICRC’s statement adds to a growing chorus of international voices condemning Israel’s back-to-back strikes on the hospital. It said further investigations would examine the decision-making behind the attacks.

Israel and the Lebanon-based group Hezbollah exchanged messages via intermediaries earlier today in order to prevent further escalation following one of the biggest exchanges of fire between the two foes in 10 months, two diplomats tell Reuters.

The main message was that both sides considered Sunday’s intense exchange of bombardment to be “done” and that neither side wants a full-scale war, one diplomat says. Parts of the interceptor missile were found inside the ship after the incident.

The Dvora ship is currently being repaired and will return to service by tomorrow.

 These timeframes were unrealistic, given the conditions on the ground as many interviewees described their journey along the Salah al-Din Road taking far longer than usual due to traffic congestion caused by the sudden mass movement of people, residents forced to walk due to other transportation means being inaccessible, and newly established checkpoints.

Rami, a 34-year-old-man living in Jabalia with his wife and three children, said he and his family left their home on October 13, 2023, after receiving automated telephone calls from the Israelis to leave the area in which their home was located and head south immediately.[\[138\]](#_ftn138)
 “The dark irony is that they were bombing the area since October 7,” he said, “and after a whole week of that \[the Israeli military\] told us to leave.”[\[139\]](#_ftn139)
 He described the Salah al-Din Road journey:

> We were not attacked directly, but many bombs were dropped in spots behind us and very close to us; one of them was less than 100 meters away. People are being deprived of access to services essential for their survival, including medical facilities, shelters, water wells and humanitarian supplies.[\[179\]](#_ftn179)

On August 26, UN aid operations in Gaza were forced to stop after the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders for Deir al-Balah in central Gaza where the UN operations center is located.[\[180\]](#_ftn180)
 The evacuation order came as the UN prepared to begin a campaign to vaccinate an estimated 640,000 children in Gaza, where the WHO said a 10-month-old baby had been paralyzed by the type 2 poliovirus,[\[181\]](#_ftn181)
 the first such case in the territory in 25 years.[\[182\]](#_ftn182)

Al-Mawasi
---------

In October 2023, Israel designated an area in al-Mawasi – a Palestinian Bedouin town on the southern coast of Gaza – a “humanitarian zone.”[\[207\]](#_ftn207)
 According to the UN, the area is approximately one kilometer wide and fourteen kilometers long and is mostly barren and sandy.[\[208\]](#_ftn208)
 There is no running water in al-Mawasi.

Since designating al-Mawasi a “humanitarian zone” the Israeli military has defined different boundaries for the area on at least fourteen different occasions on its various communications channels.[\[209\]](#_ftn209)
 On April 28, 2024, the area was expanded eastward to the Salah al-Din Road and northward to include most of Deir al-Balah.[\[210\]](#_ftn210)
 From July 22, 2024 onwards, claiming that the eastern part of al-Mawasi was used to launch rockets towards Israel, the Israeli military reduced the size of the humanitarian zone and urged people in the area eliminated to move to areas within the reduced zone.[\[211\]](#_ftn211)
 Between July 22 and August 25, the Israeli military redefined and reduced the size of the boundaries of the “humanitarian zone” at least six times. Human Rights Watch could find no communication from the Israeli authorities through any medium directing people to evacuate from those areas within the humanitarian zone on October 18 that were excluded on December 6.

On April 20, 2024, the Israeli military attacked tents sheltering displaced people inside the boundaries of al-Mawasi humanitarian zone. “Yesterday, it was 200 meters from us…We keep hearing the Israeli air forces all the time in the sky above us,” she said.[\[231\]](#_ftn231)

On May 6, the Israeli military ordered all eastern Rafah neighborhoods to evacuate “immediately” and seek shelter in the al-Mawasi area of the governorate – an area that humanitarian organizations stated was not equipped to accommodate more displaced people.[\[235\]](#_ftn235)
 The Israeli military started airstrikes on eastern Rafah that same day.[\[236\]](#_ftn236)

Every interviewee Human Rights Watch spoke to said they did not feel safe in Rafah.

After fleeing Jabalia in the north, Ziad described having to move with his family several times inside Rafah governorate because of Israeli airstrikes in the area:

> The Israelis say Rafah is safe. Farah said there had been Israeli bombardments “200 to 250 meters from her home.”[\[239\]](#_ftn239)
 On February 12, 2024, the Israeli military said it had struck a number of “terror targets” in the Shaboura district of Rafah and the strikes had concluded.[\[240\]](#_ftn240)

A Palestinian man looks at the destruction of al-Farouq Mosque and other nearby houses caused by Israeli attacks, in the Shaboura camp in Rafah on February 22, 2024. Some of this destruction appears to clearly go beyond what is militarily necessary and demonstrates an intention to systematically destroy parts of Gaza, frustrating the right to return.

On August 1, 2024, the UN said “the recent conflict in the Gaza Strip has produced a volume of debris that is 14 times greater than the combined total from all conflicts over the past 16 years.”[\[325\]](#_ftn325)
 The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) estimated the amount of debris in Gaza at 37 million tons in mid-April, or 300 kilograms per square meter stating that there was more rubble than in Ukraine, and that the rubble is likely heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance.[\[326\]](#_ftn326)
 On May 2, 2024, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) estimated that it would take between US$40 and $50 billion to rebuild Gaza and require an effort on a scale the world has not seen since World War II.[\[327\]](#_ftn327)

Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure
--------------------------------------

On February 8, 2024, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said that his office had recorded “widespread destruction and demolition by the Israeli military of civilian and other infrastructure, including residential buildings, schools and universities in areas in which fighting is not or no longer taking place.”[\[328\]](#_ftn328)
 Türk’s observations covered the period since late October 2023, but he noted reports of destroyed residential buildings and blocks taking place in Khan Younis at the time of his statement. Since October 7, 2023, at least 65 schools were completely destroyed, while 344 schools – representing 61 percent of total school buildings in Gaza – were directly hit.[\[363\]](#_ftn363)
 Widespread damage includes 156 out of the 187 UNRWA school buildings in Gaza, which have been either directly hit or damaged through strikes.[\[364\]](#_ftn364)

In North Gaza governorate, the Education Cluster classified 98 percent of school buildings in this governorate as having been either directly hit or damaged, which includes severe damage to school infrastructure according to the Cluster and UNOSAT’s classification.[\[365\]](#_ftn365)
 The Education Cluster’s assessment also found that at least 85 percent of schools in Gaza will either need “full reconstruction” or “major rehabilitation work” to be functional again.[\[366\]](#_ftn366)

According to the Scholars at Risk Network, Israeli forces have also significantly damaged, demolished or destroyed all of Gaza’s universities, including the Islamic University of Gaza;[\[367\]](#_ftn367)
 al-Aqsa University,[\[368\]](#_ftn368)
 which was functioning as a shelter at the time of the attack; al-Israa University, reportedly used by Israeli forces as a military base and a detention and interrogation center, according to Scholars at Risk;[\[369\]](#_ftn369)
 University College of Science and Technology, Palestine;[\[370\]](#_ftn370)
 al-Azhar University;[\[371\]](#_ftn371)
 and the Gaza branch of al-Quds Open University.[\[372\]](#_ftn372)

On April 18, 2024, UN experts expressed grave concern over the education loss of over 625,000 children, the pattern of attacks on schools and universities, and the killing of students, teachers and university professors in Gaza, as well as the destruction of its public libraries."

Item 1 of 8 Gaza City August 10, 2024. Israel's military said unspecified damage was reported but no casualties and that it struck several Hezbollah military structures in southern Lebanon.

The White House said it was "deeply concerned" about the Gaza school compound strike and asked Israeli officials for further details.

The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on X that he was horrified by the images from the school.

A spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, urged Israel's ally Washington to end "blind support that leads to the killing of thousands of innocent civilians, including children, women, and the elderly".

A Hamas official told Reuters the group was studying a new ceasefire proposal for discussion but did not elaborate.

Speaking to Al-Jazeera television, Khalil Al-Hayya, the head of the Hamas team for the indirect ceasefire talks with Israel, said statements of condemnation were no longer sufficient.

"Dismiss (Israeli) ambassadors, close down embassies and sever ties with the occupation," he said.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of ceasefire negotiations for Thursday, as [fears grow](/world/middle-east/us-tells-israel-that-escalations-middle-east-serve-no-one-2024-08-10/)
 of a broader conflict involving Iran and Hezbollah.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said he will not end the war until Hamas no longer poses a threat to Israelis, said he would send a delegation.

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich pushed back against the White House's accusation on Friday that he was "dead wrong" in asserting that the ceasefire deal on the table would be a surrender to Hamas.

In a post on X, Smotrich, one of Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners, thanked the U.S. There are unidentified remains," Palestinian civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal told a televised press conference.

Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought shelter in [Gaza's schools,](/world/middle-east/gazans-strive-study-war-shatters-education-system-2024-05-13/)
 most of which have been closed since Israel's war against Hamas began.

Around 350 families had been sheltering at the compound, Bassal said - some of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by Israel's onslaught on Gaza.

The upper floor housing families and the lower floor, used as a mosque, were both hit, he said.

The Israeli military said the death toll was inflated.

"The strike was carried out using three precise munitions, which can not cause the amount of damage that is being reported," the military said in a statement.

It added that no severe damage was caused to the compound, and provided aerial photos and videos which it said proved this.

The compound, and the mosque that was struck within it, served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility," Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said on X, without providing evidence.

An Israeli army official said the part of the mosque that was struck was reserved for men.

Israel says Palestinian militants embed themselves among Gaza's civilians, operating from within schools, hospitals and designated humanitarian zones - which Hamas and its allies deny.

Hamas said the strike was a horrific crime and a serious escalation. Israel says it has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza.

The Israeli strike drew condemnation from Arab states, Turkey, France, Britain and the European Union and an expression of deep concern from the U.S., which has been working with partners to prevent the 10-month-old Gaza conflict from escalating into a regional war.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

PesaCheck has looked into a post shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home filmed by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. However, the image is from 2019, not August 2024, as claimed. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Homepage

A Channel 12 election poll shows a neck-and-neck race between Likud and Blue and White — and to Netanyahu’s boundless frustration, the deciding vote is in the hands of Avigdor Liberman’s Yisrael Beytenu party.

The poll’s numbers, if the election is held today:

Likud – 31  
Blue and White – 30  
Arab parties, if they unite – 11  
Yisrael Beytenu – 10  
United Torah Judaism – 8  
Shas – 7  
Labor – 6  
New Right – 5  
Union of Right-wing Parties – 4  
Meretz – 4  
Ehud Barak’s Israel Democratic Party – 4  
Zehut – 0 (at 1.7% of votes, it falls under the 3.25% electoral threshold)

That puts a comfortable right-wing coalition (Likud, UTJ, Shas, New Right, URWP) at 55 seats, not a majority in the 120-seat Knesset — and hands Yisrael Beytenu the 10-seat swing vote.

Netanyahu and Liberman are bitter rivals after the latter’s demands on religion-and-state issues robbed Netanyahu of a coalition following the April 9 election.

Channel 12 also looked at the effect of a unified left-wing bloc of Labor, Israel Democratic Party and Meretz. The union took 15 seats, more than the 14 the parties garnered separately — and cost Blue and White two seats, dropping the larger centrist party to 28. Likud was unchanged at 31.

A union on the far-right would also have an effect. If Ayelet Shaked, the popular former justice minister, were to lead the URWP in a joint list with New Right, the combined faction would draw 12 seats, three more than the two parties separately — and rob Likud of three, driving it down to 28.

Digital manipulation distorts Israeli TV poll
=============================================

James McManagan August 08, 2024

An image of a 2022 TV station poll has been digitally manipulated. Image by N12/AAP

**WHAT WAS CLAIMED**

Nearly half of respondents to an Israeli TV station's poll said a soldier should be allowed to rape a prisoner.

**OUR VERDICT**

False. An image of an unrelated poll result has been manipulated.

AAP FACTCHECK – Forty-seven per cent of people polled by an Israeli TV station agree that a soldier should be allowed to rape a prisoner, social media posts claim.

This is false. An image of a News 12 poll has been digitally manipulated. The actual 2022 poll referred to an unrelated question.

Various [social media posts](https://archive.md/R9ZR5)
 feature a still image from a [News 12](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 broadcast in which a presenter is pictured revealing the results of a poll.

A blue box with Hebrew text has been added to the top right of the image. It translates as: "Do you agree with the claim that a soldier is allowed to rape a terrorist?"

!Social media post with Fake poll on Israel rape <image:12293>

Many social media posts incorporate the fake image. (Facebook/AAP)

The poll results are shown below, with 47 per cent for yes and 43 per cent for no.

"Wow, the majority said yes. And western government \[sic\] are supporting these monsters!", one post's caption <image:12294>
 reads, while [another says](https://archive.md/wip/toJEQ)
: "Even thinking that conducting this poll is appropriate makes me sick."

The poll can be traced back to a real segment from the Israeli news channel in May 2022 ([one minute 50 seconds](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

In the genuine broadcast footage, the question displayed reads: "Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on terrorist supporters?"

In the image shared on social media, the blue box overlays the screen, obscuring the original question, which appears along with the results on a screen behind the presenter.

!Fake image next to real image of faked Israel rape poll. <image:12295>

Seen side by side, it's clear the second image is a doctored version of the first (the original). (N12/Facebook/AAP)

The false claim and image follow reports of footage showing [alleged sexual abuse](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-813732)
 of Palestinian detainees by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

On Wednesday, August 7, the US State Department urged the IDF to fully investigate the allegations.

**The Verdict**

**False** – The claim is inaccurate.

The original poll, from May 2022, asked about the government's reliance on terrorist supporters.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image is a screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. However, the AAP fact-checked the image and found it to be digitally manipulated. The original poll's question was different from the one presented in the image.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows an authentic question about a soldier being allowed to rape a prisoner is false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`

Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post suggests that the disguise was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses the disguise as a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also links to an X post that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim that the disguise was due to fear of Israeli bombing, but it does suggest this as a possible reason.

Further information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as official statements or reports confirming the reason for the disguise.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post suggests that the disguise was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes a link to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and the other in civilian disguise. <image:57> The forum post also contains several comments from users discussing the situation.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses the disguise as a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also links to an X post that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim that the disguise was due to fear of Israeli bombing, but it does suggest this as a possible reason.

Further information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as official statements or reports confirming the reason for the disguise.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image is of Esmail Qaani in disguise, potentially due to fear of Israeli bombing, but lacks definitive confirmation. The source is a forum post, and further verification is needed to confirm the claim's accuracy.

Iran general’s whereabouts in question after Israeli strikes on Hezbollah
=========================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

[Patrick Wintour](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour)
 Diplomatic editor

Conflicting reports include house arrest of Esmail Ghaani, who was in Beirut at time of Hassan Nasrallah’s killing

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/middle-east-crisis-live-eu-israel-iran-lebanon-blog-news-updates-hezbollah-hamas-unifil)
    

Mystery surrounded the whereabouts and health of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander Esmail Ghaani, amid reports that he was being investigated over how Israel managed to penetrate and crush the command structure of [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
, the Lebanese militia at the heart of the Iranian “axis of resistance”.

It is known that Ghaani, who leads the IRGC’s al-Quds force, was in Beirut at the time of the killing of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, but Iranian authorities have insisted he is alive, and even in line for an award for valour.

The Middle East Eye news outlet claimed Ghaani had been put under house arrest and was being investigated over the failures that allowed [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 to penetrate the Hezbollah network so effectively.

Over the past two months, Israel has killed several Hezbollah leaders and appears to have made a leap forward in the quality of its intelligence.

Another Arabic outlet claimed Ghaani had suffered a heart attack during questioning.

Israeli sources said the reports, regardless of their veracity, showed the degree of stress inside the IRGC over the destruction of the Hezbollah leadership in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

One source said: “This has been a mind-blowing success as a result of a decade of intelligence gathering. “Iran is not the only one that does not want a large-scale war, but everyone knows how disastrous this war is.”

Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the royal court in Riyadh, said: “The Iranians have stated: ‘If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war.’”

!Esmail Ghaani in military uniform <image:13373>

Ghaani was appointed commander of al-Quds, a branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in 2020. On Tuesday, Iraj Masjedi, the deputy commander of al-Quds and a former Iranian ambassador to Baghdad, told reporters that Ghaani was “in good health and is carrying out his daily duties”.

Western diplomats said it was possible that Israel was considering a campaign of assassinations of the Iranian leadership as the most escalatory end of the range of options to be used in its imminent response to Tehran’s attack last week.

The diplomats believe Joe Biden came away from a conversation on Wednesday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, still unclear how and when Israel would respond. “He has the whiff of cordite in his nostrils” said one source, of Netanyahu, adding that there was little obvious leverage to restrain him.

The three other options are a strike on Iranian military targets of an order similar to the Israeli strike in April; an attack on economic infrastructure, including oil facilities; or an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.

The US has strongly advised Israel not to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, and it has been made clear that neither the US or the UK would provide the practical help probably needed to undertake such an attack. Israeli officials have also been advised that it would be unwise to start its response at the top end of the escalatory scale.

Western diplomats believe the Israeli strikes could start as early as next week, but others calculate that the more Netanyahu delays until closer to the US presidential election on 5 November, the more leverage Netanyahu will have over the Democrats to support any decision he takes. Senior former Israeli intelligence officials argue that an attack on Iranian oil infrastructure would work, and not lead to a big escalation in oil prices."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:57>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post suggests that the disguise was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes a link to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and the other in civilian disguise. <image:57> The forum post also contains several comments from users discussing the situation.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses the disguise as a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also links to an X post that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim that the disguise was due to fear of Israeli bombing, but it does suggest this as a possible reason.

Further information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as official statements or reports confirming the reason for the disguise.

Esmail Qaani visited Iraq for several hours on Tuesday \[Getty\]

The commander of Iran's Quds Force, [Brigadier General Esmail Qaani](https://www.newarab.com/tag/esmail-qaani)
, carried out a short visit to Baghdad on Tuesday, during which he met senior Iraqi officials, political leaders, and commanders of armed factions closely aligned [with Tehran](https://www.newarab.com/tag/iran)
, according to sources who spoke to _The New Arab_'s Arabic language edition. 

Qaani's visit, which lasted several hours, came amid growing concerns in Tehran that Israel may soon expand its regional military campaign to include targets in Iraq.

According to sources cited by _Al-Araby Al-Jadeed,_ Qaani warned Iraqi officials of "imminent Israeli attacks" that could target individuals, facilities, camps, and offices affiliated with Iran-backed groups.

Qaani also urged the Iraqi leadership to address internal vulnerabilities and raised alarms over possible Israeli infiltration of key state institutions.

Qaani was accompanied by Nasser Akhdar, deputy secretary-general of the Islamic Radios and Televisions Union, a Tehran-backed media alliance.

The visit followed a late-night meeting held the day before between several Iraqi faction leaders to discuss recent drone strikes in Iraqi Kurdistan, which most factions denied any involvement in.

Sources close to the factions said Qaani had met several senior officials, including Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid.

During those talks, he conveyed Iran's fears that the conflict in Syria could spill over into Iraq in the coming two months, with Israel potentially targeting more than 300 sites across the country, including military camps, offices, and individual figures.

Qaani also shared Tehran's concerns about a broader security shift in Iraq that could destabilise the region as a whole.

According to the same sources, discussions also touched on recent attacks on energy infrastructure in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Most factions denied responsibility, while Qaani delivered several messages from Tehran urging Baghdad to bolster its security and intelligence preparedness amid suspicions of deepening Israeli infiltration of Iraqi institutions.

"The Israeli penetration is part of a new strategy by \[Tel Aviv\]," one source said, quoting Qaani. (Photo by Kamchatka of Geophysical Survey/Anadolu via Getty Images)](/sites/default/files/styles/image_684x385/public/2226999380.jpeg?h=52bad4fe&itok=yVk62pRV)

Iranian and Iraqi intelligence reportedly believe Israel was attempting to widen divisions between Baghdad and Erbil to distract from its deepening incursions into Iraq's political, military, and technical institutions.

There has been no news regarding the whereabouts of Major General Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in recent days.

Qaani was notably absent from a ceremony where IRGC Air Force Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh received a medal for striking Israel last week. Israel’s Channel 12 also reported that the possibility of Qaani being injured in a bomb explosion is under investigation.

**Iranian Silence and Denials**

The Iranian government has remained silent regarding Esmail Qaani's disappearance. Mohammad Mehdi Hemmat, the son of a martyr from the Iran-Iraq war, posted on X , “Our dear Haji Esmail Qaani is in perfect health. Don’t fall for the enemy’s media games, which only show their weakness.” 

Media outlets close to the IRGC also shared a social media post from Qaani’s nephew, asserting that he is alive.  

Old reports from Mehr News Agency and IRIB, titled “Denial of Esmail Qaani’s Martyrdom,” were republished on social media on October 5 and 6, though these reports were outdated.

Additionally, Hamshahri Online stated that the Parliament News Agency, citing a member of the Parliament’s Security Commission, confirmed Qaani’s well-being. However, the Parliament News Agency later denied interviewing Abbas Golrou, the member in question.

**Who is Esmail Qaani, The Missing Commander?**  

Esmail Qaani was appointed as the commander of the Quds Force following the assassination of his predecessor, Qasem Soleimani. He was then appointed deputy commander of the Quds Force.

Despite his long tenure in Quds Force, Esmail Qaani struggled to match Qasem Soleimani’s influence. The extensive propaganda, including legendary stories, books, films, and countless public events left little room for Qaani to build his mark.

One of Qaani’s rare public comments came in December 2022 regarding women without hijabs. His disappearance, however, has sparked jokes and speculation on social media.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post suggests that the disguise was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes a link to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and the other in civilian disguise. <image:57> The forum post also contains several comments from users discussing the situation.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses the disguise as a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also links to an X post that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim that the disguise was due to fear of Israeli bombing, but it does suggest this as a possible reason.

Further information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as official statements or reports confirming the reason for the disguise.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Esmail Qaani's whereabouts and health have been subjects of speculation following reported Israeli strikes. One article from IranWire states that Qaani was missing after Beirut airstrikes. The GSN article mentions allegations of injury from an Israeli strike, which Tehran denied. The Al-Monitor article from December 2022 features an image of Qaani and discusses his criticism of women without hijabs. The Guardian article from October 10, 2024, discusses Qaani's whereabouts and includes an image of him in military uniform. The New Arab reported that Qaani warned Iraqi leaders of potential Israeli attacks. However, none of the provided sources confirm the claim that Qaani was disguised in a hijab due to fear of Israeli bombing.

From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post suggests that the disguise was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes a link to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and the other in civilian disguise. <image:57> The forum post also contains several comments from users discussing the situation.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses the disguise as a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also links to an X post that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim that the disguise was due to fear of Israeli bombing, but it does suggest this as a possible reason.

Further information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as official statements or reports confirming the reason for the disguise.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian article from October 10, 2024, discusses Esmail Ghaani's whereabouts following Israeli strikes, mentioning conflicting reports about his health and location, and includes an image of him in military uniform (<image:13373>). The New Arab reported on July 17, 2025, that Esmail Qaani warned Iraqi leaders of potential Israeli attacks during a visit to Baghdad, but the image (<image:57>) is not included in the article.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from Al-Monitor that features an image of Esmail Qaani and discusses his criticism of women without hijabs. The article is from December 2022. ([https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/12/irans-quds-force-leader-criticizes-women-without-hijabs](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/12/irans-quds-force-leader-criticizes-women-without-hijabs)) <image:13374>, <image:13375>, <image:13376> Another article from IranWire, published on October 7, 2024, reports that Qaani has been missing after Israeli airstrikes in Beirut.

The Gulf States Newsletter (GSN) published an article on October 23, 2024, discussing speculation about Esmail Qaani's health and status, including allegations of injury from an Israeli strike or being an Israeli spy, both of which were denied by Tehran. ([https://www.gsn-online.com/news-centre/key-players/iran-esmail-qaani](https://www.gsn-online.com/news-centre/key-players/iran-esmail-qaani)) <image:i>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Esmail Qaani's whereabouts and health have been subjects of speculation following reported Israeli strikes. One article from IranWire states that Qaani was missing after Beirut airstrikes. The GSN article mentions allegations of injury from an Israeli strike, which Tehran denied. The Al-Monitor article from December 2022 features an image of Qaani and discusses his criticism of women without hijabs. The Guardian article from October 10, 2024, discusses Qaani's whereabouts and includes an image of him in military uniform. The New Arab reported that Qaani warned Iraqi leaders of potential Israeli attacks.

Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post suggests that the disguise was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes a link to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and the other in civilian disguise. <image:57> The forum post also contains several comments from users discussing the situation.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The Nairaland forum post, which includes the image, discusses the disguise as a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also links to an X post that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the claim that the disguise was due to fear of Israeli bombing, but it does suggest this as a possible reason.

Further information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as official statements or reports confirming the reason for the disguise.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian article from October 10, 2024, discusses Esmail Ghaani's whereabouts following Israeli strikes, mentioning conflicting reports about his health and location, and includes an image of him in military uniform (<image:13373>). The New Arab reported on July 17, 2025, that Esmail Qaani warned Iraqi leaders of potential Israeli attacks during a visit to Baghdad, but the image (<image:57>) is not included in the article.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from Al-Monitor that features an image of Esmail Qaani and discusses his criticism of women without hijabs. The article is from December 2022. ([https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/12/irans-quds-force-leader-criticizes-women-without-hijabs](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/12/irans-quds-force-leader-criticizes-women-without-hijabs)) <image:13374>, <image:13375>, <image:13376> Another article from IranWire, published on October 7, 2024, reports that Qaani has been missing after Israeli airstrikes in Beirut.

The Gulf States Newsletter (GSN) published an article on October 23, 2024, discussing speculation about Esmail Qaani's health and status, including allegations of injury from an Israeli strike or being an Israeli spy, both of which were denied by Tehran.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Esmail Qaani's whereabouts and health have been subjects of speculation following reported Israeli strikes. One article from IranWire states that Qaani was missing after Beirut airstrikes. The GSN article mentions allegations of injury from an Israeli strike, which Tehran denied. The Al-Monitor article from December 2022 features an image of Qaani and discusses his criticism of women without hijabs.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. While there are reports of speculation about Esmail Qaani's whereabouts and health following Israeli strikes, and an image of him in military uniform, there is no evidence to confirm that the image of him in a hijab is authentic or that it was due to fear of Israeli bombing. India Today rejected allegations against Qaani as fake news.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli
=================================================================================================

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

The first phase of the war, he [writes](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1710796924092129517)
 on X, involves “destroying most of the enemy forces” that have infiltrated into Israel and have killed civilians and soldiers.

Israel has also begun an offensive into Gaza “and it will continue without hesitation and without respite – until the goals are achieved.”

“We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win,” he writes.

A senior Biden administration official says on a call with reporters that the US “will treat Hamas for what they are. They are an international terrorist organization.”

Washington’s focus is currently on “ensuring that the Israelis have what they need to respond appropriately,” says the official.

The White House official says the US is ready “to offer all appropriate means of support to the people and government of Israel.”

“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.”

“We remain deeply aligned,” said the official, adding that Israel’s response is likely to continue “for some time.

The official says that that US will continue to “work with parties throughout the region” to make sure the fighting doesn’t spread from Gaza.

The official also speaks about the potential of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying that it is “premature to say the impact” that the war will have on those efforts.

“That process has a ways to travel,” says the official, adding that “terrorist groups like Hamas will not derail any such outcome.”

Israel is now facing a deep crisis after witnessing the heroism of Hamas militants, Abu Ubaida says, adding that Israeli soldiers fell before them “like locusts.”

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to urge a halt to the violence in and around Gaza.

A Saudi Foreign Ministry statement says the two discussed “the necessity of working toward an immediate halt to the escalation.”

Prince Faisal emphasizes “the kingdom’s rejection of the targeting of civilians and the need for all sides to respect international humanitarian law.”

The Saudis have been in talks with the White House over potentially forging diplomatic relations with Israel, efforts which have now been thrown into question.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

“In Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,” Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. “The federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.”

Germany’s authorities are also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,” she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country’s regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

“At a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,” he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a “visible and systematic static presence,” and the use of soldiers from France’s Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

#### [Hamas official: Our attack has only just begun](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-official-our-attack-has-only-just-begun/)

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group’s onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must “leave our occupied lands.”

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that “we are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.”

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

By [AFP](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/afp/ "AFP")

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.”

Martin says he could “see tensions rising” during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking.”

“We believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,” he says.

“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,” he says.

“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it’s a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today’s attack.”

Israel’s courts will operate on an emergency footing tomorrow and will only hold hearings on urgent matters due to the Hamas invasion of southern Israel and the war with Gaza, it announces.

A statement put out by the Israel Courts Administration says the decision was made by Justice Minister Yariv Levin “with the knowledge of and \[in accordance with the\] opinion of Supreme Court President Justice Esther Hayut and Director of the Courts Administration Judge Michael Spitzer.”

The decision applies to Israel’s magistrates, district and labor courts, as well as the Supreme Court and the rabbinical courts.

Hearings scheduled for parole committees on Sunday will be postponed to a later date.

The statement condemns “the recent unprovoked and continuous attacks by Israel on Palestinian towns, cities, and refugee camps” as well as “the inhumane siege imposed on the nearly 2 million inhabitants of Gaza,” which the organization says is “an implied declaration of open war on the Palestinians which oblige them to be in constant self-defense.”

The organization calls on the US government “to exert pressure on the occupation regime to immediately cease these atrocities” and criticizes any Arab and Muslim nations that have normalized relations with Israel.

According to the US State Department, Blinken calls “on all leadership in the region to condemn” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and also urges the PA to “enhance steps to restore calm and stability in the West Bank.”

Today in Ramallah, Abbas chaired an emergency leadership meeting of the Palestinian Authority, and according to the official news agency Wafa, “gave instructions to provide protection for the Palestinian people, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terrorism of settlers and the occupation forces.”

Abbas also “gave directions to provide all that is necessary to bolster the resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people in facing the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation and settler gangs.”

Netanyahu says the army is currently clearing Hamas terrorists from everywhere they infiltrated, going house to house, “restoring control to our hands.”

He sends love and condolences to all the bereaved families that lost loved ones “brutally murdered in cold blood.” He prays for the recovery of the injured.

And he warns Hamas that Israel will hold it responsible for the hostages it has taken. “Israel will avenge anyone who is harmed,” he says, “in so much as a hair on their head.”

He says Israel stands in solidarity with residents of the south, who stood firm and fought bravely.

He praises the security forces, calling them the latest in the long history of Israel’s war heroes.

“You are fighting now for all of our homes, for all of our futures,” he says.

“We are all with you, we all love you, we all salute you.”

He praises the members of the emergency services, and says their spirit will help overcome our enemies.

He says he spoke with President Biden and other world leaders from France, Britain and beyond, thanks Biden for his “unreserved support,” and says he secured international backing for “freedom of action” for Israel.

Netanyahu says all Israelis “are in this together. It will take time. It will be hard. We have challenging days ahead of us.”

But he promises that “with God’s help, with our combined strength, and with our belief in an eternal Israel, we will win.”

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use “all the power” of the IDF to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, and tells Gaza’s residents to “get out now.”

Calling today’s events something “never before seen in Israel,” he vows to ensure “it will never happen again.”

He begins by saying Hamas “invaded Israeli territory this morning,” and started a “cruel and evil war,” targeting innocent civilians young and old.

“We will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,” he says.

“Hamas wants to murder us all,” Netanyahu says, “murdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

“It is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,” an enemy “that massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.”

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its power to destroy Hamas’s capabilities,” he says. “We will fight them to the bitter end and avenge this black day they plotted for Israel and its people.”

Israel will target Hamas everywhere — turning the places it “hides and operates” into “cities of ruin.”

He tells the “residents of Gaza” to “get out now because we will operate everywhere and with full force.”

US President Joe Biden backs Israel’s right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

“Today the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we’ll make sure that they’ll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,” Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“The world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities… Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s unconscionable.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.”

“It’s also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It’s heartbreaking.”

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to “make sure Israel has what it needs.”

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

“Let there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,” Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

“He was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else — including today, on this tragic morning,” says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has decided to extend an emergency situation to the entire State of Israel, his office says.

Earlier, Gallant declared the “special situation” within a range of 80 kilometers from the Gaza Strip.

The “special situation” allows the military’s Home Front Command to restrict gatherings and close off areas.

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, “I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.”

“Today’s violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population… are in themselves an aggression,” Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a “colonial” entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

“I am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,” he says. “Violence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.”

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemns the terror attacks.

“I am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,” Türk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn’t been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

At the time, Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn’t understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They’d last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

“He had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,” said Polin, who didn’t know anything specific about his son’s plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn’t usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son’s who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night “nature party” near Kibbutz Re’im.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

“One list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,” Polin says. “But he wasn’t at any of those places.”

Friends were at the couple’s home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven’t been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

“They think there’s still a bunch of people hiding in the area,” Polin says, adding that the mother of his son’s friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. “Every time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There’s very little we can actually do.”

The Israel Defense Forces says it struck another two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip, used by Hamas.

The “Palestine” building was used by a number of Hamas units, including intelligence, weapon production, and offices of senior members, the IDF says.

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas’s general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri (YouTube screenshot)

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group’s onslaught against Israel an “open battle” aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived “desecration” of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims — by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified “new reality” at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are “about to be freed,” anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are “senior officers.” He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians “humanely.” Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

“We have a plan for all stages of this conflict,” al-Arouri says, “both in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.” He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the “best scenario” for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his “hope and trust” that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight “to defend Al-Aqsa,” especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

“We entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,” he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon’s territory.

Yair Lapid (L), Benny Gantz (C) and Benjamin Netanyahu (R) (Flash90)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposes that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency government following Hamas’s devastating surprise attack Saturday morning.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would “deal with security challenges alone” and in a manner that would allow “substantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums” for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing “for any responsible and determined security action.”

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join “a reduced, professional, emergency government” and says it would be impossible to manage a war with “the extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,” essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

The Magen David Adom ambulance service said in Rishon Lezion, medics treated two men aged 28 who were seriously hurt.

In Yavne, a 73-year-old woman was seriously hurt and a 77-year-old man was lightly hurt, MDA says.

In Bat Yam, a 24-year-old man was moderately hurt, MDA says.

In Tel Aviv, four people were wounded, including one in moderate condition, MDA adds.

The victims are being taken to hospitals in the area.

Hamas claimed to have launched 150 rockets from the Gaza Strip at Tel Aviv in the barrage.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

“At this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,” the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the “gigantic failure” of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, “at this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.”

The White House slams a Republican “disinformation” campaign blaming the Biden administration for today’s Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

“Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,” she adds.

The Health Ministry says 1,104 people have been wounded in the attacks, which included Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

The death toll is expected to rise higher.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points, overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Thirteen hours after the start of the attacks, there are reported to still be 22 “active” areas in southern Israel, where gunmen are still active or feared to be in the field.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

“We attach high importance to the restoration of calm in the region as soon as possible, and strongly condemn the loss of civilian lives. We underline that acts of violence and associated escalations will not benefit anyone, and call on the parties to act with restraint and avoid impulsive steps.”

Ankara also urges “the parties” to work toward a two-state solution.

As of 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, MDA says it has enough blood supply for the time being and has asked people to hold off on donating until tomorrow or later in the week.

At Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv alone, 650 individuals showed up to donate blood. Overwhelmed by the turnout, Ichilov announced that it had closed its blood donation station until further notice.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Sérgio França Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

“It is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,” Erdan writes.

“Israel expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas’ war crimes and genocidal agenda.”

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

“The State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” he writes. “We will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.”

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be’eri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom’s Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

The Hamas terror group says it is holding hostage dozens of Israeli soldiers and officers in the Gaza Strip.

In a statement, Hamas claims the captives “have been secured in safe places and resistance tunnels.”

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

The European Union “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and stressed Israel’s right to self defense.

“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence,” says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a statement issued on behalf of all 27 member states, “which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.”

Borrell says the EU “stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks.”

A man says his wife, two young children and mother-in-law have been taken to Gaza and that he has seen them in a video from the coastal enclave.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife’s phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

“I have seen my wife’s phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “I contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don’t know what’s going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.”

Israeli activists in the US launch a crowdfunding campaign to assist residents of southern Israel.

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

“We join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,” organizers say. “This is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.”

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

The Israeli consulate in New York also says it is accepting all offers of help and support.

The Secure Community Network, which coordinates security for Jewish communities in North America, urges vigilance but says there are no known threats to US Jews related to the terror onslaught in Israel.

The group says it is coordinating security measures with law enforcement and other partners.

“SCN recommends Jewish facilities review and enforce security protocols, and maintain coordination with law enforcement,” the group says in a statement.

Police in the New York town of Ramapo, which has a significant Jewish population, increase patrols to “ensure our residents’ safety during this crisis,” town supervisor Michael Specht says.

The Israel Defense Forces says it carried out airstrikes against two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip that were used to house Hamas assets.

“The Hamas terrorist organization deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF says.

“Prior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,” the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an “emergency government” to manage “the difficult and complex operation ahead of us” after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

“The State of Israel is at war. It won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,” Lapid says in an announcement.

“A short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I’m willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.”

Netanyahu, he says, “knows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can’t manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.”

“Forming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,” says Lapid.

“The State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren’t managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won’t deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.”

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that “the offer is real, this isn’t a political thing. The offer is there.”

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

During the call, which was requested by Secretary Austin, Gallant details recent events in Israel and operations carried out by the IDF and defense establishment, his office says.

Gallant says Israel is currently at war, and has been facing terror attacks against its citizens since this morning – this includes men, women, children and elderly individuals.

“The State of Israel will win this war, and Hamas will be held responsible for its actions,” his office says.

Gallant thanks Austin and the US Administration for their support for Israel.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Hamas’s surprise attack on southern and central Israel this morning.

“The secretary-general is appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes,” says a statement from his spokesperson.

Guterres “is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times.”

“The secretary-general urges all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration,” the statement continues. “He stresses that violence cannot provide a solution to the conflict, and that only through negotiation leading to a two-state solution can peace be achieved.”

By [Amanda Borschel-Dan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/amanda-borschel-dan/ "Amanda Borschel-Dan")

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

“I think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse — of their ending” — that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. “Everyone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.”

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are “not even relevant anymore,” he says, and negotiations “under or over the table” will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel’s northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

“Either they’re going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,” he says.

“Starting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties… but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

“It’s the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn’t go into a major ground operation, it’s the end of this government’s political life,” says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be’eri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

File: National Unity party head Benny Gantz gives a statement. (Video screenshot)

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is “completely unified.”

“I want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,” he says. “All Israel’s citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.”

“There is no coalition and opposition now,” Gantz adds, “just a single fist that will pound the enemy.”

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part “will be making a terrible mistake.”

“It must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen… and pray for the recovery of all the injured.”

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. “Israel can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,” Gantz says.

Former US president Donald Trump weighs in on the ongoing Hamas attack on Israel, calling them a “disgrace” and asserting that Israel “has every right to defend itself with overwhelming force.”

“Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden Administration,” he says, ostensibly blaming US policy on Iran for today’s attacks.

“We brought so much peace to the Middle East through the Abraham Accords, only to see Biden whittle it away at a far more rapid pace than anyone thought possible. Here we go again,” Trump says in a statement.

“Forces conducted a naval pursuit and targeted dozens of terrorists after they attempted to infiltrate into Israeli territory,” the Israel Defense Forces says in a statement, publishing a video of the incident.

“The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists and thwarted dozens of them, as well as two rubber boats and two additional vessels,” the IDF adds.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s attack on Israel rises to more than 100, Hebrew-language media cite medical officials as saying.

The number is seen as certain to rise further.

Some 800 people have been wounded in the attacks, which have included hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

The rate of rocket fire from Gaza appears to have slowed in the last hour, with sirens sounding in several communities.

The Israeli military is still focusing on fighting Hamas terrorists still in Israeli territory.

Ra’am’s Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra’am party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: “In light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.”

“I urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.”

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing “lots of gunfire” nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife’s phone — which doesn’t answer — to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving “far more successful” from Hamas’s perspective than it would have expected, the TV station’s Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn’t know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a “proud operation.”

“We support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,” Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

“We support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,” says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists “until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

“Today’s operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,” he says.

“The resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people’s struggle against the Zionists.”

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “Down with Israel,” “Down with America,” and “Welcome Palestine,” according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

Over nine hours since the Hamas terror group launched a deadly assault on Israel with terrorists infiltrating from land, air and sea, there are still gunmen in a number of Israeli communities.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire — while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Saudi Arabia calls for an “immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint” amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‘repeatedly warned’ of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its “repeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a “credible peace process” to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden are expected to speak in the next hour amid a massive and deadly attack by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

“Today we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day. Innocent civilians were massacred and wounded, and many are still under attack,” Herzog says in a statement.

“The State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,” he says.

“I call upon the family of nations – this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran. Now is the time to stand firm with Israel in support of its just and moral battle in the face of an abhorrent enemy,” he says.

Palestinian media outlets report 160 killed and over 1,000 wounded recorded by hospitals in the Gaza Strip since this morning.

The toll likely includes those targeted by the Israeli military in airstrikes, and during clashes with troops in southern Israel.

Shoval Kahlon, a resident of Sderot, describes the situation in the border town which was infiltrated by Hamas terrorists.

“There are Hamas troops walking around. We see videos of them. They’re walking round with impunity,” she tells the Kan public broadcaster from the bomb shelter of her home.

Security forces are fighting terrorists in at least four areas in the town, the broadcaster reports.

“We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to alarms, we thought it was the usual rocket attacks but we started hearing gunshots on the street, sounded like it came from the parking of our building. Then we realized something was unusual. We then started seeing Hamas people in pickup trucks. They knocked on the homes of residents, who thought they were Israeli soldiers. They took them hostage,” says Kahlon.

The United States “unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks,” Watson says.

US “National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken to Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and we remain in close contact with our Israeli partners,” Watson adds.

A baby has been found at Kibbutz Kfar Aza near the Gaza border, and the parents are nowhere to be seen, Channel 12’s Tamir Steinman reports.

The baby is alive. Kibbutz residents are pleading for anyone who has information on the baby’s family to come forward.

The kibbutz is one of several places where Hamas gunmen are still believed to be on the loose.

Steinman, speaking a few minutes later, also says several of his friends and contacts who live in areas close to the Gaza border, including some he was talking to earlier today, “are no longer answering… and it’s clear why they’re not answering.”

The UN’s Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland “vehemently condemns” today’s multi-front Hamas assault of Israeli towns near Gaza and the firing of rockets into central Israel.

“These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland says in a statement.

“I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians.”

“This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink,” he adds.

The mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, says his city is still under attack.

“Don’t open the doors, stay inside, close the windows… we’re still searching the area,” he tells local residents via Channel 12.

He says the Hamas leadership, from Ismael Haniyeh on down, are “animals” who “must be harmed and killed.”

The people of Israel “haven’t yet seen” what’s happened in the city, he says — “inhuman acts” against innocent people. The terrorists have to be “wiped out,” he says.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are “murderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.”

“People still don’t understand the numbers” and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many “bodies on the ground… terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.”

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

At least 40 people have been killed and over 700 injured since the start of the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, the Magen David Adom emergency service says.

The Health Ministry says 779 people have been hospitalized.

Terror cells from the Gaza group have infiltrated a number of communities in the south of the country.

In addition, thousands of rockets have been fired at the center and south.

Hamas has claimed to have taken a number of hostages from Israel to the Gaza Strip. There has been no confirmation from Israel.

The assault has been ongoing since approximately 6:30 a.m.

The death toll is expected to rise.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a statement at the start of the security cabinet meeting, calling for all the citizens of the country to unite.

“Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first goal is first of all to cleanse the area of the enemy forces that have infiltrated, and restore security and peace to the settlements that were attacked,” Netanyahu says.

“The second goal, at the same time, is to exact a huge price from the enemy, also in the Gaza Strip,” he says.

“The third goal is to fortify other arenas so that no one makes the mistake of joining this war,” Netanyahu says.

“We are at war, in war, you have to keep calm. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war,” the premier says.

The official name for the campaign by the Israel Defense Forces amid the devastating Hamas attack is Operation Swords of Iron.

Ukraine’s President writes a long post condemning the devastating Hamas terror assault on Israel and says that all its details should be revealed to the world.

Here is the post in full:

“Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

“Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

“Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

“Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable.

“All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

“All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

“To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”

Channel 12 broadcasts footage from earlier this morning apparently showing a bulldozer breaking through the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Dozens of terrorists from the Hamas terrorist group infiltrated into Israel by land, air and sea, going on deadly rampages through border communities.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell calls for the immediate release of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped and taken to Gaza amid a massive assault by the Hamas terror group.

“News of civilians taken as hostages in their homes or to Gaza are appalling,” Borrell writes on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

“This is against international law,” he writes. “Hostages must be released immediately.”

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

European leaders roundly condemn the massive assault by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Hamas contributes to “the intensification of violence,” adding Israel “has our full solidarity” and “the right, guaranteed by international law, to defend itself against terrorism.”

France expresses “full solidarity with Israel and the victims” and underscored “its absolute rejection of terrorism and its commitment to Israel’s security.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he “firmly condemns” the attacks.

Italy also backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack.”

Britain’s foreign minister James Cleverly condemns the “horrific attacks” and underlined Israel’s right to self-defense.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says: “Appalling images from Israel. Terror organization Hamas is waging an unprecedented attack on Israel… This violence must stop; Israel has every right to defend itself.”

Spain says it is “shocked by the indiscriminate violence” of the attacks on Israel while Ukraine and the Czech Republic say they back Israel’s right to defend itself.

The European Union “unequivocally” condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she “unequivocally” condemns the “terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,” adding that it was “terrorism in its most contemptible form.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,” she adds.

“This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.

European Council president Charles Michel also condemns the “indiscriminate attacks launched against Israel and its people this morning inflicting terror and violence against innocent citizens.”

“My thoughts are with all the victims. EU stands in solidarity with Israeli people in this horrific moment.”

The Israel Defense Forces announces it is canceling schools in central and southern Israel, meaning roughly 1 million children will stay home tomorrow, amid ongoing fighting between Israel and terror groups in the Gaza Strip.

All schools south of Netanya and north of the central Negev are to be closed and businesses can only be opened if there is ready access to bomb shelters, the military says.

Gatherings are also restricted to 10 people outdoors and 50 people indoors in those areas, the IDF Home Front Command says.

The restrictions are valid till Sunday at 6 p.m., but will likely be extended further amid the fighting.

Hezbollah praises the massive Hamas operation against Israel, and says it is message to Arab countries normalizing with Israel.

The terror group Hezbollah says it is in direct contact with the Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad, and calls on Arab and Muslim peoples around the world to declare their support to Hamas and the Palestinian people, adding that armed resistance is the only way to confront the Israeli “aggression.”

Hezbollah adds that the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” operation launched by Hamas against Israel is a message to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world, in particular those countries seeking normalization with Israel.

It also calls on the Israeli government to learn the “important lessons” taught by the “Palestinian resistance.”

“Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” he says. “And we will win.”

“The enemy will pay a price like they have never known before,” he says, in his first public statement on the matter, some five hours since the start of the assault by the Gaza-based terror group.

There are reports of a number of dead and nearly 300 wounded as terrorists infiltrate a number of southern towns and thousands of rockets are fired at the center and south of the country.

Israeli residents near the Gaza Strip continue to ask for help and report on shooting by terrorists inside the towns while there is little or no IDF presence on the streets.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: “They are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.”

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

“I don’t understand how this is still going on. We’re in this situation since 6 a.m.,” she says. “Four people cannot fight them off alone

“Send help, please,” she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources. In an Instagram story timed to 9:55 a.m. cited by Ynet, a resident of Kfar Gaza writes: “I’m begging you!!! We can’t catch anyone! There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!”

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: “With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel’s “desecration” of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,” he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” — countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran — to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nations to join “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Hamas military commander Muhammad Deif (courtesy)

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement calling the morning’s attacks and infiltration “the day of the great revolution.”

He urges Israeli Arabs to take up arms, and encourages Arabs on Israel’s borders to join in the attack.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of return,” he says. He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and the Triangle area to “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” – countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran – to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nation to join the battle “Flood al-Aqsa.”

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: “Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel’s Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.”

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah’s statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

_The 9-year-old Sham in a hospital in Idlib after she was rescued from under the rubble in Armanaz town in Idlib countryside, following an earthquake that struck the area – February 7, 2023 (Facebook/White Helmets)_

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake on February 7, 2023. The claim that the image shows a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024 is false.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a Houthi drone attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided image does not show Israelis fleeing the airport. The image shows people waiting in line at what appears to be an airport.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Houthi militia. The attack killed one man and wounded four others. <image:2525>

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) reports on a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. <image:2528> The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also reports on a Houthi drone strike in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a Houthi drone attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided image does not show Israelis fleeing the airport. The image shows people waiting in line at what appears to be an airport.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is inaccurate because the image does not depict Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack. While the attack did occur on July 19, 2024, the image shows people waiting in line at an airport.

`false`

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. The baby, two months premature, was given an oxygen mask that engulfed her small face, and was transported to a larger hospital that has incubators.

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. "I'll embrace and look after her," he was quoted as saying in a Sky News report.

But Dr. Mohammed Salama, who heads the neonatal department at the Emirati hospital in Rafah, where the infant was being cared for, told NPR she died Thursday, despite his team's best efforts to save her.

The baby's uncle told The Associated Press that the girl, who was named Sabreen after her mother, was [buried Thursday next to her father](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-infant-girl-mother-killed-airstrike-c39c281b545485aa4076f60459f2234a)

Hisham al-Sayed's mother holds up a photograph of her son in April 2016

**Palestinian militant group Hamas has released a video appearing to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip.**

The clip appears to show Hisham al-Sayed lying in a bed looking dazed and wearing an oxygen mask - the first sighting of him since 2015.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said releasing a video of a sick man was "reprehensible and desperate."

The BBC has not been able to independently verify the footage.

Hamas alleges that Mr al-Sayed is an Israeli soldier, but both the Israeli government and his family say he is a civilian with mental health problems.

The charity Human Rights Watch, which has criticised Mr al-Sayed's "unlawful detention" in the past, says he was last seen walking into the Gaza Strip in April 2015 for unknown reasons, having made similar attempts to cross the frontier in the past.

In the video released by Hamas the 34-year-old, who is a member of Israel's Bedouin Arab minority, could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.

A television monitor also in the room showed news footage from an economic conference in Qatar earlier this month.

No further details were given by the Palestinian militant group about the detainee's condition other than a reference on Monday to his health having deteriorated.

Israel says he is one of two citizens, the second being Avera Mengistu, currently being held captive by Hamas in violation of international law.

Both are believed to have crossed willingly into the Gaza Strip despite Israel banning its citizens from entering the Palestinian enclave.

There was some suggestion that the video's release was an attempt by Hamas to pressure Israel into resuming prisoner swap negotiations.

The two sides have engaged in prisoner swaps in the past, most notably in 2011 when abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

Content: "Despite being in isolation, she had a daily visitor.

Her son, Jihad Al Suwaiti, 32, scaled the hospital building each day to sit outside her window and check that she was wearing her oxygen mask — an act that unwittingly catapulted him into the global spotlight after a picture of him sitting outside his mother’s window that his brother posted on Facebook went viral.

Before long, Jihad’s story had traveled the world, and a video even emerged of an imam in Sudan during prayers referencing him as an example of how all [Muslims](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-arabia-umrah-pilgrims-return-mecca-stilled-covid-19-slump-n1242033)

His dedication didn’t stop there: When his mother died on July 17, Jihad and his siblings stole her body after hospital staff said they couldn’t release it to the family.

Brothers, nephews and friends came in seven different cars in a plan devised to distract and confuse the ambulance drivers who chased the brothers as they stole their mother’s body, he said.

The ambulance drivers lost track of which car was carrying the body and the brothers successfully took their mother back to Beit Awwa, he said.

 where Rasmiye was being treated, confirmed to NBC News that her body was stolen because her children did not want her body to be wrapped in plastic.

Muslim tradition holds that the dead should be buried as soon as possible, with the body wrapped in a white shroud. Even when she asked, he would not tell her she had cancer but instead said she was getting treatment for her feet.

As her health deteriorated with the coronavirus, Jihad would watch her from her window ledge to make sure she was taking in oxygen.

Asked about the now-famous picture of him scaling the hospital wall to see his mother in her final days, Jihad said the moment the doctors left the room, he would climb through the window and sit by her bed protected only by a mask and gloves.

“If I left her for one second, she would take off her oxygen mask,” he said.

In her last moments, as death began to take her, she muttered.

Oct. But earlier this year, new decrees for handling the coronavirus dead were given for Muslim burials, according to Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Territories.

“This is a rule of necessity and necessities allow for prohibitions, therefore the deceased is not washed, nor shrouded and is buried in a plastic body-bag,” Hussein [told Reuters.](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-israel-palestinian/death-in-the-holy-land-coronavirus-changes-burial-for-jews-muslims-idUKKBN21K0QE)

“She said, ‘If I die because of this disease, don’t bury me in a plastic bag!’” recalled Jihad, the youngest of her nine children.

“I held her with my own hands, dug her grave and buried her the way she asked me to,” he said.

So far Jihad has faced no sanction for breaking the law and putting others at risk.

Born in 1947 in the hilly [Palestinian](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uae-makes-nice-israel-palestinians-decry-betrayal-n1236718)
 town of Beit Awwa in the occupied West Bank, Rasmiye Al Suwaiti is one of the 387 people to have died in the West Bank and Gaza since the start of the pandemic, from a total of 44,684 cases, according to [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
.

Those who knew her described her as a simple woman who never learned to read or write but had an unparalleled zeal for life and a heart overflowing with love.

“She had the entire world’s kindness in her heart,” Jihad said.

![Image: Jihad Al SuwaIti](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_39/3414923/200925-palestine-mum-mc-13202.JPG)

Jihad Al Suwaiti scales the hospital building. Hisham would look after the flock, and from the milk, Rasmiye would make yogurt, labneh and cheese that they would sell, along with the olives and oil, at markets in Beit Awwa.

Once home, they would share the household chores, and their father would help the children study because Rasmiye could not read or write, Riham said.

By their children’s accounts, their life was happy even as the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-peace-plan-will-likely-extend-decades-old-conflict-analysts-n1125456)
 waxed and waned around them.

### The family bond

Following her husband’s death, Rasmiye spent the rest of her life in mourning, Riham said. By the end of May, the Palestinian Authority’s strict measures appeared to have paid off, with around 450 confirmed cases and just three deaths in the kidney-shaped territory, according to the authority’s figures. She has covered the Middle East conflict — on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides — for more than a decade.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence includes articles and images related to the Gaza war, including images of destruction, suffering, and medical care. The NPR article specifically mentions a baby girl in Gaza who died after her mother was killed in an airstrike. However, none of the search results provide information that directly supports the claim about the image of the Palestinian girl holding her sister's oxygen mask.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. The search results include images from the Gaza war, but none of them match the image in the claim. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

.

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. [Ynet](/wiki/Ynet "Ynet")
 reported that she also cooked at times with basic ingredients she was provided.[\[36\]](#cite_note-toimalnutrition-38)

The [Qassam Brigades](/wiki/Qassam_Brigades "Qassam Brigades")
 (the militant wing of the Hamas movement) claimed that three other hostages were killed as a result of the raid.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)
 They did not name any of them, or show photographs, but they claimed that one of the three was a US citizen and released a short video with text in Arabic, Hebrew, and English.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
 The video depicted three unidentifiable corpses with their faces obscured by censor bars.[\[42\]](#cite_note-44)
 The Brigades did not give details of how the hostages supposedly died, but said they were killed by the Israeli military.[\[c\]](#cite_note-46)

> "In exchange for them, your own army killed 3 of your own captives in the same attack; one of them holds a USA citizenship" - Qassam Brigades, 9 June 2024.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)

Rescue
------

The IDF said that they worked with [Shin Bet](/wiki/Shin_Bet "Shin Bet")
 and Israeli police to free the four Israeli hostages.[\[44\]](#cite_note-ynet8june-47)
 It was also later reported that the operation was [aided by intelligence support from the United States](/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war "United States support for Israel in the Gaza war")
[\[45\]](#cite_note-cbs8junebrennan-48)

.[\[46\]](#cite_note-49)
 The operation was planned for several weeks, and was carried out after an intelligence opportunity arose.[\[14\]](#cite_note-bbc-16)
 Some of the special forces members entered the refugee camp in a vehicle with a mattress on top, posing as [Palestinian refugees](/wiki/Gaza_Strip_evacuations "Gaza Strip evacuations")

In a statement on Saturday, the Government Media Office said more than 75 people also were injured in the attack on al-Jaouni school in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since October 7 and the besieged enclave faces dire shortages of food, water, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

On Saturday, dozens of Palestinians, [including five journalists](/news/2024/7/6/five-journalists-killed-as-israel-steps-up-bombardment-across-gaza)
, were killed as the Israeli military stepped up its bombardment of the territory.

Videos taken at the scene of the attack on the UNRWA school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat showed twisted metal at the collapsed building. Emergency workers also tried to cover two bodies as they were quickly brought into the medical complex.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement that 50 injured Palestinians were taken to the hospital.

In a [statement](https://x.com/IDF/status/1809662855660360020)
 shared on social media on Saturday night, the Israeli army said its air force “struck several terrorists” in the area of al-Jaouni school.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said hundreds of Palestinian families had sought shelter at the school after they were forced to flee Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza.

The families “chose the middle area \[of the Gaza Strip\] because Israeli forces said the middle area is a safe zone”, Khoudary said.

“Everyone in the Gaza Strip believes that they are not safe, wherever they go.”

Last month, an Israeli attack on an UN-linked school – also in Nuseirat refugee camp – [killed at least 40 people](/news/2024/6/6/israel-bombs-unrwa-school-in-gaza-kills-32-displaced-palestinians)

“We were sleeping, and at two in the morning, missiles rained down on us. A young boy could be seen sifting through pools of blood on the ground.

Footage shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir el-Balah and verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency also showed children and young people being rushed from ambulances.

They included a girl with a bandaged arm, another with a bloodied face and a boy bandage across his head. They pulled us from under the rubble, and all we saw were shrapnel, debris, and dust. How will we live?”

Israeli air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16

Shock and horror at scene of Gaza blast

**At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured.**

The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel said it had struck several Hamas “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”.

A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were "very, very serious" and should be investigated.

The attack comes as [hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3gvp5q9y2go)
, following months of false starts.

Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas.

It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to "pretty significant adjustments" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire.

A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war.

Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded.

Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.

The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter.

One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit.

"This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning," she said.

Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Many were women and children."

She added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated.

A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat [killed at least 35 people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crggq0jygq6o)
.

Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school.

After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.

The head of the Unrwa described the June incident as "horrific" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was "shocking" but could not be confirmed.

Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.

The organisation has rejected this.

In April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

At least 50 people were injured in the strike, Gaza officials say.

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken "numerous steps" to "mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence".

Hamas militants were using the location as a "hideout" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said.

"Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel," it added.

Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.

Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel.

The IDF said it was "looking into the details" of the incident.

Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.

"We don’t have all the information yet. <image:2684>!Reuters People walk through the ruins of a school that was hit by an airstrike, killing at least 16 people. Since the war began, we have had more than half of our facilities hit," Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.

"Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted.

More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders.

Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, [said](https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1833976405149057277)
 the evacuation was a "highly complex operation" that was "completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together."

A WHO [report](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-09-2024-who-analysis-highlights-vast-unmet-rehabilitation-needs-in-gaza/)

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

!SUGGESTED COVERAGE: US sends military advisors to Israel <image:13438>

#### [SUGGESTED COVERAGE: US sends military advisors to Israel](/video/1300635)

The Pentagon has sent military advisers, including a Marine Corps general versed in urban warfare, to Israel to aid in its war planning and is speeding multiple sophisticated air defense systems to the Middle East days ahead of an anticipated ground assault into Gaza.

**LOS ANGELES** - The House of Representatives passed a measure on Friday automatically registering men aged 18 to 26 for selective service.

It was part of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets out the [U.S.](https://www.foxla.com/tag/us)
 government’s [military](https://www.foxla.com/tag/military)
 and national security priorities over the next fiscal year. 

**RELATED:** [**House passes defense bill automatically registering men 18-26 for draft**](https://www.foxla.com/news/house-passes-defense-bill-automatically-registering-men-18-26-draft)

While it hasn’t been invoked in over half a century, it’s mandatory for all male U.S. Failure to register is classified as a felony and comes with a host of legal challenges.

While there isn't currently a draft in place, Congress and the president can reinstate the draft and force male citizens to serve in the military in the event of a national emergency or war that all-volunteer military can't adequately support.

**RELATED:** [**US military draft: What you need to know**](https://www.foxla.com/news/us-military-draft-age-iran-israel-drone-attack)

Here's what you need to know about the military draft. 

What is the draft?
------------------

The military draft - officially known as the [Selective Service System -](https://www.sss.gov/)
 requires nearly all male [U.S.](https://www.foxla.com/tag/us)
 citizens and male immigrants ages 18 to 25 to register with the government, in accordance with federal law. 

"The Selective Service System and the registration requirement for America’s young men provide our Nation with a structure and a system of guidelines which will provide the most prompt, efficient, and equitable draft possible, if the country should need it," the official website explains.

The selective service is a government bureau separate from the Defense of Defense.

Who needs to register?
----------------------

Almost all men who are 18-25 years old and live in the U.S. A conscientious objector is one who is opposed to serving in the [armed forces](http://www.military.com/join-armed-forces)
 and/or bearing arms on the grounds of moral or religious principles.

If you served on active duty and were discharged before your 26th birthday, you still have to register.

If you are 26 or older, it's too late to register.

You can see the Selective Service's [full list of requirements here.](https://www.sss.gov/register/who-needs-to-register/)

Are women eligible to register for the draft?
---------------------------------------------

The law currently requires that only men register with Selective Service. Afterward, a publicly attended, nationally televised and live-streamed lottery is conducted. [You can learn more about the process here.](https://www.sss.gov/about/return-to-draft/#s1)

_The Associated Press and FOX News contributed to this report._

[Military](/tag/military)
[U.S.](/tag/us)
[Instastories](/tag/series/instastories) citizens to register for the selective service, also known as the military draft, when they turn 18. In the event that the law is changed to include registering women, "Selective Service is prepared to expand registration," the website reads.

What if you don't register?
---------------------------

According to law, it is considered a federal felony, punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 or a prison term of up to five years, or a combination of both, if you fail to register with Selective Service.

A felony conviction means you lose your right to vote and the right to own, possess and use a firearm, among other things.

How do you register?
--------------------

The easiest way to register is [online.](https://www.sss.gov/register/)

Forms are also available at post offices, high schools, and DMV locations.

If implemented, how would the draft work?
-----------------------------------------

According to the Selective Service, the draft, if implemented, would have similarities to that of the Vietnam War. 

That means the Selective Service would most likely hold a draft lottery based on dates of birth. Each succeeding year, a draft eligible man drops into the next lower priority group until he has reached his 26th birthday, at which time he is over the age of liability for the draft.

If you're drafted, will you automatically go to combat?
-------------------------------------------------------

It's important to note that even though someone is registered and their number is called, they may not be inducted automatically into the military. They may be eligible for a deferment; categories might include married persons or college students.

You may also be excluded for medical or psychological reasons, may declare yourself to be a conscientious objector, or may even be able to enlist in a specific branch or career field to avoid combat duty.

In the event a national emergency required a draft, the Selective Service has protocol in place for when that happens.

First, the president and Congress would need to authorize the draft. must register for Selective Service. citizens who live outside the country
*   Immigrants (legal permanent residents and undocumented immigrants)
*   Refugees and asylum seekers
*   Transgender people who were assigned male gender at birth
*   People with disabilities

If you are a military veteran or a military reservist, you are still required to register with Selective Service."

### No Current Plans for Reactivation

In 2024, [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/10/trump-military-draft-mandatory-service/)
 that "a cluster of influential former administration officials and GOP lawmakers ... have mused aloud about a national service mandate and other measures to remedy what they see as a 'crisis' facing the all-volunteer military." However, Donald Trump responded that it was a "ridiculous idea."

The same year, in an analysis for [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/10/military-draft-conscription-soldiers-technology-nato-europe-russia-ukraine/)
, political scientist Raphael S. The process would look something like this:

*   **Physical and Mental Assessments:** Registrants would be evaluated at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) to check their physical and mental fitness for military service.
*   **Eligibility Verification:** Factors such as age, health and legal status would be reviewed to confirm eligibility.
*   **Deferments and Exemptions:** Depending on the person, some may qualify for deferments (temporary postponements) or exemptions (permanent exclusions) from service.

Again, classification would only occur if Congress and the president decide to resume a draft. Any attempt to bypass Congress would be unconstitutional and almost certainly trigger massive legal, political and public pushback, including court challenges.

Until that happens, registering is a precaution, not a signal that anyone's about to get called up.

**Read More:** [Everything You Need to Know About the Military Draft](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/everything-you-need-know-about-military-selective-service-system.html)

### Legal Framework for Reinstating the Draft

  
Any attempt to bring back the draft would typically be in response to the declaration of a national emergency or a large-scale war that would overburden the U.S. Cohen wrote: "After decades of becoming increasingly rare, the military draft is back in the debate."

Cohen noted that, despite the fact that modern warfare often emphasizes technology and drones, many countries are reintroducing or reconsidering the military draft, because large-scale conflicts still require a significant number of people. Despite occasional public anxiety during times of global tension or military escalation, there have been no formal moves by Congress or the executive branch to bring back the draft.

What Could Trigger a Return to the Draft?
-----------------------------------------

Although returning to the draft wouldn't happen lightly or without significant cause, possible scenarios that might trigger it include:

*   A large-scale ground war that requires a big increase in troop numbers
*   Multiple military conflicts going on around the world simultaneously, stretching U.S. At that time, those qualified for induction would have the opportunity to file claims for exemptions, deferments and postponements from military service.

### Appeals and Conscientious Objection

  
Those who believe they should not be inducted due to personal beliefs or circumstances have avenues to appeal:

*   **Local Draft Boards:** Registrants could present their case to a local board, which will decide whether to grant or deny their claim.
*   **Appeal Process:** If the local board denies the claim, the individual could appeal to a district appeal board. If the district board were to deny the claim, and the vote wasn't unanimous, further appeal to the national appeal board would be possible.

Those whose objections are based on moral or religious grounds -- aka conscientious objectors -- could (if approved) be assigned to noncombatant roles within the military or, in some cases, to civilian service contributing to the national health, safety or interest.

For more information on conscientious objection, visit the [Conscientious Objectors](https://www.sss.gov/conscientious-objectors/)
 page on the Selective Service System's website.

You may be wondering, "What happens if you get drafted and refuse to go?" Refusing to comply with a draft order can lead to legal penalties, including fines and possible jail time.

Why Are People Worried the Draft Might Come Back?
-------------------------------------------------

In recent years, a whole host of global events, political tensions and information spread online have stirred public concerns that the U.S. involvement.
*   Heightened tensions with China over Taiwan, as regional instability could have serious international consequences.
*   Military recruitment shortfalls, where voluntary enlistment numbers sometimes fall below targets, raising questions about future manpower.
*   Social media misinformation and rumors, which can exaggerate or falsely claim the draft is being reinstated.

The Likelihood of the Return of the Draft
-----------------------------------------

While the Selective Service System remains fully operational, the return of the military draft is considered unlikely under current circumstances. Registration was suspended in early 1975 and reinstated in 1980.
*   All men ages 18-25 are still legally required to register with the Selective Service System.
*   Reinstating the draft would require a new act of Congress and the president's approval.
*   Despite online rumors and speculation, there is currently no plan or indication that a draft will be reinstated.
*   The Selective Service System maintains a rapid activation plan to be ready if an emergency arises.

Report: US Not Prepared to Conduct a Military Draft
===================================================

Washington Report

June 25, 2024

[](https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngaus.org%2Fnewsroom%2Freport-us-not-prepared-conduct-military-draft&title=Report%3A%20US%20Not%20Prepared%20to%20Conduct%20a%20Military%20Draft)

The nation lacks the processes and systems to conduct a military draft in response to a near-peer conflict, according to a new report by a think tank based in Washington, D.C.

The United States ended conscription in 1973, relying since on the all-volunteer force.

But all U.S. males ages 18 to 25 are still required to register with the Selective Service System in case a draft is ever needed again.

"To be clear, this report is not advocating for implementation of a draft," states the Center for a New American Security report, which was released June 18.

"Rather, it is a call to ensure that if the United States ever faced an existential threat requiring the president and Congress to pass a draft, the systems, processes, and structures necessary to successfully execute it would be in place," it continues.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 demonstrates that modern conflict is still a "fundamentally human endeavor" despite technological advances, the report notes.

The report cautions the draft is neither a tool to meet end-strength requirements nor achieve social policy goals, but "a matter of meeting human capital requirements for near-peer conflict."

Currently, men are automatically registered for the draft when they either get a driver’s license or apply for college in at least 46 states and territories, _The Seattle Times_ reports.

In 2023, the National Registration Rate was 84% for military service, and more than 15 million men had registered nationwide, [according](https://www.sss.gov/about/)
 to the Selective Service System.

CNAS's study comes as Congress is weighing changes to the SSS through provisions in the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act.

The House version of the fiscal 2025 NDAA contains a provision to automatically register all eligible men, while a provision in the Senate version would require women to register for Selective Service.

Neither provision is expected to survive a conference committee, which will reconcile the differences between the two bills.

To develop their conclusions, CNAS officials relied on historical and comparative research, interviews with policymakers and experts, legal reviews and a draft mobilization tabletop exercise.

CNAS analysts also examined past mobilization exercises conducted since the draft's end, including Nifty Nugget in 1978 and Proud Saber in 1982.

The analysts additionally conducted a mock draft mobilization exercise that was geared toward implementing a draft in the wake of aggression from China.

The exercise operated under the understanding that 500,000 induction notices would produce 100,000 inductees to the military services ready to ship to basic training within 193 days.

Among the challenges the exercise identified: the current 18-25-year-old male population may not produce enough conscripts, the legal challenges to an all-male draft and social media playing into the perception of a draft's unfair implementation.

The CNAS report made recommendations to the nation's legislative and executive branches and the SSS.

Among the report's recommendations, CNAS suggests considering older individuals for a draft first as a "future combat environment" might necessitate personnel with more life experiences or advanced skills.

The full CNAS report can be [found here](https://www.cnas.org/press/press-release/new-report-from-cnas-assesses-u-s-mobilization-capabilities)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024. While the National Defense Authorization Act includes automatic registration for selective service, and the Pentagon has sent military advisors to Israel, multiple sources explicitly state that the draft has not been reinstituted.

Therefore, the claim is false.
