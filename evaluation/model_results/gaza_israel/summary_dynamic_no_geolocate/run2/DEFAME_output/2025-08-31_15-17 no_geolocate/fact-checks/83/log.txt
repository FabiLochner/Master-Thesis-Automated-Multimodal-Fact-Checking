Useful result: From [Source](https://www.marca.com/futbol/barcelona/2021/07/18/60f4544946163fed7b8b458e.html): 
Content: The article from Marca.com, published on July 18, 2021, reports that Joan Laporta, the president of FC Barcelona, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, in Jerusalem. <image:13369> The meeting took place at Beit Hanasí, the official residence of the President of Israel.

Useful result: From [Source](https://jewishwebsite.com/date/2021/07/22/): 
Content: The search result from Jewishwebsite.com mentions that FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, participated in a tree-planting ceremony in Israel on July 20, 2021. The article also mentions a meeting with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel. <image:13357>

The claim '<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts a meeting between FC Barcelona's president and Israeli representatives that occurred on July 18, 2021, as reported by Marca.com, not in September 2024. The Gaza war was not ongoing at the time of the meeting.

So, the overall veracity is: false
