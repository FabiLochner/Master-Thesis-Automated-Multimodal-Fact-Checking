Useful result: From [Source](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html): Found exact image on website with title: The 'manual of repression' shared by modern tyrants | International
Content: The article from El País, published on July 20, 2023, discusses how modern tyrants share tactics of repression. The article includes an image of a girl in the rubble, which is also present in the claim. <image:4699> shows Abdulrahman Almawwas speaking at the Oslo Freedom Forum, with the girl Sham Sheikh in the background.

The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake in February 2023, as reported by [Enab Baladi](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/), [UAE Times](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/), and [El País](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html). The claim misrepresents the image's context, falsely associating it with a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
