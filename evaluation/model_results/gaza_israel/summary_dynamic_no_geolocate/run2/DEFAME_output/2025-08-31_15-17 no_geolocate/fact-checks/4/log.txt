Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on December 22, 2024, stating that the U.S. launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%E2%80%93UK_airstrikes_on_Yemen): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "US–UK airstrikes on Yemen" discusses the military operations conducted by the U.S. and U.K. against the Houthi movement in Yemen, starting on January 12, 2024, in response to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The first phase of attacks, codenamed Operation Poseidon Archer, involved cruise missile and airstrikes. The strikes were halted during the 2025 Gaza war ceasefire but resumed between March 15 and May 6, 2025, under the codename Operation Rough Rider. The article also mentions the involvement of other countries, including Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. The article includes a timeline of the attacks, reactions from various parties, and assessments of the impact on shipping. The article also mentions the 2024 Houthi drone attack on Israel, and the 2024 Tel Aviv drone attack. The article also mentions the 2024 Israeli attacks on Yemen. The article also mentions the 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire. The article also mentions the 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport. The article also mentions the May 2025–present Israeli attacks on Yemen. The article also mentions the 28 August 2025 Israeli attack on Yemen.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/21/us-says-conducted-strikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemens-capital): 
Content: Al Jazeera published on December 21, 2024, that the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. <image:1>. The strikes targeted a missile storage facility and a command-and-control site. The Houthis launched a missile at central Israel, which fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. The U.S. did conduct airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 22, 2024, as reported by sources like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/21/us-says-conducted-strikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemens-capital). However, while the strikes were in response to Houthi attacks, the evidence does not explicitly confirm they were a direct reprisal for an attack on Israel's capital.

So, the overall veracity is: false
