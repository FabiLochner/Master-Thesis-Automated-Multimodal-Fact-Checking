## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)) both state that the image of Mel Gibson's social media post is fake. The post includes an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass and the words "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way." ![image 47](media/76.jpg)

The articles mention that Gibson does not have any public social media accounts. The independent Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar also debunked the same fake Gibson post. ![image 10602](media/2025-08-30_07-23-1756538625-870825.jpg) ![image 10603](media/2025-08-30_07-23-1756538626-022837.jpg) ![image 10604](media/2025-08-30_07-23-1756538629-838588.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)), have debunked the post. Additionally, Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The evidence from multiple reliable sources confirms that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. The post includes an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass and the words "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."
