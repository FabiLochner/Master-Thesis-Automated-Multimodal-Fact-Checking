## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 23](media/34.jpg)) shows a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)), The Globe and Mail ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-massive-fire-breaks-out-at-oil-refinery-south-of-tehran/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-massive-fire-breaks-out-at-oil-refinery-south-of-tehran/)), and The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/massive-fire-breaks-out-oil-refinery-near-irans-capital](https://www.newarab.com/news/massive-fire-breaks-out-oil-refinery-near-irans-capital)) all published articles on June 2, 2021, about the fire. The fire was caused by a liquefied gas line leak and explosion.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple news sources, including CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran)), reported on Israeli airstrikes against military targets in Iran on October 26, 2024, in retaliation for attacks against Israel. The CNN article includes an image of Tehran after the explosions (![image 23](media/34.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image depicts a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran. The reverse image search indicates that the image was taken on June 2, 2021, and the fire was caused by a gas leak.

The web search confirms that on October 26, 2024, there were Israeli airstrikes against military targets in Iran. However, the provided image is not related to the airstrikes.


## Final Judgement
The image is from a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran in June 2021, not from an Israeli bombing on October 26, 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim shows a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran that occurred on June 2, 2021, as reported by The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)). While there were Israeli airstrikes on Tehran on October 26, 2024, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), the image is unrelated to those events.
