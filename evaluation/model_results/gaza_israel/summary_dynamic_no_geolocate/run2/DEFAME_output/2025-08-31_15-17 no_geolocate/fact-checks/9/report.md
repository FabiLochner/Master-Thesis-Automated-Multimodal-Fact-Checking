The web sources provide information about Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats Project provides a map of the strikes (![image 6927](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501849-721809.jpg)).

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 9](media/9.jpg)) appears in an article from the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) website. The image also appears in an article from The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, which discusses Iran's "Kamikaze Doctrine" and includes an image of an explosion in Isfahan, Iran (![image 132](media/2025-07-18_13-28-1752845313-392533.jpg)).
