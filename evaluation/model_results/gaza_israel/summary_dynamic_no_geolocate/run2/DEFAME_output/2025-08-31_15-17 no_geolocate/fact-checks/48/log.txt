Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/g-s1-16958/gaza-ceasefire-talks-israel-hamas): 
Content: NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks. <image:4093>, <image:4092>. The talks are based on a three-phase proposal that President Biden laid out in May. The article mentions that Benjamin Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump told Benjamin Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal to hurt Kamala Harris's campaign is not supported by the evidence. While a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, did occur and involved discussions about the Gaza ceasefire, there is no evidence to support the specific claim. In fact, one source suggests Trump encouraged the deal, and both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denied the allegations, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248).

So, the overall veracity is: false
