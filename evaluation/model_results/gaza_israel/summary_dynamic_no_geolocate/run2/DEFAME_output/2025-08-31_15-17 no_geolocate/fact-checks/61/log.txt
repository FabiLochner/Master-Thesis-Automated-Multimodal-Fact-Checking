Content: Reuters published an article with an image of an Israeli tank. <image:13242>

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. Despite searches about the conflict in Gaza and related topics like tanks and clothing, no evidence supports the specific scenario of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes. The image search did not yield any results that match the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
