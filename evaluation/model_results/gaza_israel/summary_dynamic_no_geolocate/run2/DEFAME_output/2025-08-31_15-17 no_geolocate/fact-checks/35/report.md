The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite)) published an article discussing Israeli airstrikes in Beirut that killed Hassan Nasrallah, targeting the Haret Hreik neighborhood.

The Washington Post also includes the image of the ring (![image 24](media/35.jpg)).
