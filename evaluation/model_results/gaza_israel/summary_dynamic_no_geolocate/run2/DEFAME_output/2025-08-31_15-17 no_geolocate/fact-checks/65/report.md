## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was heavy Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip, including Deir al-Balah, in March 2025. The attacks resulted in numerous casualties. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows the event, but there is no evidence to support this. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was heavy Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip, including Deir al-Balah, in March 2025, resulting in casualties. However, the image search did not yield the image in question. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the event described in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that there was indeed heavy Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip, including Deir al-Balah, in March 2025, resulting in casualties. However, the image search did not yield the image in question, and the reverse image search did not provide any results. Therefore, the claim that the image specifically depicts the event described cannot be fully verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially accurate. While there was heavy Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, resulting in casualties, the image's origin and its specific connection to the event cannot be verified. The reverse image search yielded no results, and the image search did not find the image in question. Therefore, the claim is unproven.
