Content: The Guardian published an article on October 1, 2024, discussing Iran's attack on Israel. The article mentions that Iran launched about 180 high-speed ballistic missiles. It also states that the Iron Dome is used for short-range interceptions. The article includes a video of the explosion in Tel Aviv <image:13286> and a video of Iranian missiles flying over Israel <image:13285>. The article also mentions that in April, only nine out of 120 ballistic missiles fired by Iran got through. The article also mentions that Ukraine's commander-in-chief said that 4.5% of Russian ballistic missiles were intercepted. The article also includes a photograph of projectiles above the Israeli city of Ashdod <image:13284>.

The claim 'The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack is not supported by the evidence. According to a Washington Institute article, approximately 50 out of 200 missiles hit Israel, suggesting an interception rate of around 75%, which contradicts the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
