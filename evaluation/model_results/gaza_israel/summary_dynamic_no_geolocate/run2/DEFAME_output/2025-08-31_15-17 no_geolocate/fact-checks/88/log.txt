Useful result: From [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/global/story/iran-rejects-allegations-against-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-as-fake-news-2616700-2024-10-14): 
Content: India Today published an article on October 14, 2024, rejecting allegations against Esmail Qaani as fake news. <image:10653>

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of speculation about Esmail Qaani's whereabouts and health following Israeli strikes, and an image of him in military uniform, there is no evidence to confirm that the image of him in a hijab is authentic or that it was due to fear of Israeli bombing. India Today rejected allegations against Qaani as fake news.

So, the overall veracity is: false
