### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) is of Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s private residence in Caesarea. According to a PesaCheck article published on August 28, 2024, the image is from 2019 and was featured in a Times of Israel article ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).

The Times of Israel website ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/)) published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone attack on Netanyahu's home, but the image is not present in the article. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow" ([https://beyondhighbrow.substack.com/](https://beyondhighbrow.substack.com/)).


## Elaboration
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. However, the image is from 2019, not August 2024, as claimed. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article.

The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone is not supported by the evidence. The Times of Israel published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone attack on Netanyahu's home, but the image is not present in the article.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it is from 2019, not August 2024. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is from 2019 and not taken by a Hezbollah drone. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, but it was taken in 2019, not August 2024, as the claim states. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image was captured by a Hezbollah drone. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).
