## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) fact-checked the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating that the White House offered no evidence. The Anadolu Agency ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/no-us-funding-used-for-condoms-or-family-planning-in-gaza-aid-group/3466324)) reported that the International Medical Corps refuted the claim, and a review of USAID data showed no record of condom deliveries to Gaza.

The White House announced that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza," with the White House press secretary describing the expense as a waste of taxpayer money ([Source](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt)). Elon Musk, the head of DOGE, commented on the expense. <image:k> ![image 12980](media/2025-08-31_15-30-1756654209-001151.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The White House stated that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza" ([Source](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt)). However, CNN fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)). The International Medical Corps refuted the claim, and USAID data showed no record of condom deliveries to Gaza ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/no-us-funding-used-for-condoms-or-family-planning-in-gaza-aid-group/3466324)).

The evidence indicates a discrepancy between the White House's statement and other sources. While the White House claimed DOGE halted the payment, other sources deny the existence of such funding.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to conflicting information. More information is needed to determine whether the $50 million was indeed intended for condoms in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not factually accurate. While the White House stated that DOGE halted a payment for condoms in Gaza, other sources refute this claim, and there is no evidence to support it. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not entirely accurate. While the White House stated that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for condoms in Gaza, other sources, including CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) and the Anadolu Agency ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/no-us-funding-used-for-condoms-or-family-planning-in-gaza-aid-group/3466324)), refute this, and there is no evidence to support it.
