## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli Olympic team Bring Them Home pins")
web_search("Israeli Olympic team 2024 Olympics")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://stljewishlight.org/sports/those-viral-images-of-israeli-olympians-advocating-to-bring-them-home-are-not-actually-from-the-olympics/): 
Content: The search result from stljewishlight.org, published on July 30, 2024, states that the image of Israeli swimmers spelling out "Bring Them Home" is not from the 2024 Olympics. ![image 926](media/2025-07-20_10-03-1753005797-362249.jpg) The article mentions that the claim that the Israeli team was banned from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins is misleading.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include information about the 2024 Summer Olympics, mentioning Israeli athletes and the Olympic Committee of Israel. One source from the Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/israeli-olympic-team/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/israeli-olympic-team/)) features articles about Israeli athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics and includes the image in the claim (![image 14](media/16.jpg)). Another source ([https://theicenter.org/icenter_resources/israel-at-the-2024-summer-olympics/](https://theicenter.org/icenter_resources/israel-at-the-2024-summer-olympics/)) discusses the 2024 Summer Olympics but does not mention the "Bring Them Home" message. The official Olympics website ([https://www.olympics.com/ioc/israel](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/israel)) provides contact information for the Olympic Committee of Israel.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image of the Israeli swimmers spelling out "Bring Them Home" is not from the 2024 Olympics. The claim that the team was banned from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins is also misleading. While the image is associated with the 2024 Olympics in some contexts, the provided sources clarify that the image's context is not as described in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image of the Israeli swimmers spelling out "Bring Them Home" is not from the 2024 Olympics, and the claim about the pins is misleading. The evidence from multiple sources confirms that the image's context is misrepresented.

`false`

### Justification

The claim that the team was banned from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins is also misleading.
