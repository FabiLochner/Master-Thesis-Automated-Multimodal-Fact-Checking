## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published by Al Jazeera on February 4, 2025, Donald Trump is planning to extend a funding ban on UNRWA and is expected to sign an executive order (<image:0>). NPR reported that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA; the article was updated on February 4, 2025, and originally published on February 3, 2025 (![image 3720](media/2025-08-23_00-35-1755909301-490503.jpg)).

Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, in an article published on February 5, 2025, discusses a Trump Executive Order that orders the reevaluation of the United Statesâ€™ commitment to UNRWA (![image 3709](media/2025-08-23_00-34-1755909288-981428.jpg)). The document also directs government agencies not to use any funds for a contribution, grant, or other payment to UNRWA.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding. NPR reported that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA, and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP reported an executive order that directs government agencies not to use any funds for a contribution, grant, or other payment to UNRWA. However, the exact date of the executive order is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence, but it was signed sometime before February 3, 2025.

The claim states that the executive order was signed on January 20, 2025. The evidence does not confirm this specific date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of a specific date in the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The KFF.org article, published on August 15, 2025, and originally published on January 28, 2025, lists executive actions taken by President Trump, including two executive orders issued on January 20, 2025, but does not mention any executive order related to UNRWA funding. [KFF.org](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/)

NAFSA.org published an article on August 21, 2025, listing executive orders and actions during the Trump-Vance administration, including several executive orders signed on January 20, 2025, and Executive Order 14169, which is about reevaluating and realigning United States Foreign Aid.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding before February 3, 2025. However, the claim specifies the date of January 20, 2025.

The additional search results show that Trump did sign executive orders on January 20, 2025, but none of them are related to UNRWA funding.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding, but the exact date of January 20, 2025, is not confirmed. Further searches reveal that while Trump did sign executive orders on that date, none of them were related to UNRWA funding.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding, the specific date of January 20, 2025, is not supported by the evidence. Additional searches confirm that Trump signed executive orders on that date, but none of them concerned UNRWA funding.
