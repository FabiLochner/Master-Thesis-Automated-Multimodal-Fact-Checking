## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on January 29, 2025, fact-checking the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating that the White House offered no evidence for the story and that USAID spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the White House's claim about blocking $50 million in aid for condoms to Gaza. The Guardian reported that no money from the US went to condoms in Gaza, and only a small amount was sent to Jordan for contraceptives. The Washington Post also published an analysis on the claim.

Al Jazeera published on January 30, 2025, an article discussing the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. The article states that there is no public evidence of plans to send millions of dollars of condoms to Gaza. The International Medical Corps (IMC) stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms, nor provide family-planning services. The article also mentions that USAID reports do not show any record of condoms shipped to Gaza.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Anadolu Agency reports that Elon Musk retracted his claim that the US intended to send $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza, while krcrtv.com reports that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza" (![image 13561](media/2025-08-31_16-24-1756657485-568793.jpg)). The White House press secretary called the expense a waste of taxpayer money.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including CNN and Al Jazeera, report that there is no evidence to support the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was allocated for condoms in Gaza. Furthermore, USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East during the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. While one source mentions DOGE halting a $50 million payment for condoms in Gaza, this is contradicted by other sources.


## Final Judgement
The claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including CNN and Al Jazeera, have fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it. Furthermore, USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East in the relevant fiscal years.
