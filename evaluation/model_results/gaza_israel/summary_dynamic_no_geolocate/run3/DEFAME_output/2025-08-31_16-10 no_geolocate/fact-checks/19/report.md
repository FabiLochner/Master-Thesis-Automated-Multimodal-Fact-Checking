## Elaboration
The image in the claim is present in an article on siasat.com, which reports on a meeting between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The article is dated February 4, 2025. The claim states that the image shows Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk. The evidence does not mention Elon Musk.

The claim is therefore not entirely verifiable. It is possible that Elon Musk was present at the meeting, but the evidence does not confirm this.
