Content: The website dawahilallah.com published an article on August 14, 2025, discussing the destruction of two Israeli tanks by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis using Yassin-105 shells and a side IED. <image:4221> The article also mentions the ongoing conflict, including the targeting of Israeli forces and the destruction of vehicles. The article includes a link to a source. The website also has other articles. <image:4223>, <image:4228>, <image:4231>, <image:4234>

The claim '<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is inaccurate. While the image depicts a burning tank, reverse image searches link it to the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, not an ambush in October 2024 as stated in the claim. The image was found on websites like [9jaflaver.com](https://www.9jaflaver.com/) and [Nairaland.com](https://www.nairaland.com/), which reported on the October 7, 2023, attacks.

So, the overall veracity is: false
