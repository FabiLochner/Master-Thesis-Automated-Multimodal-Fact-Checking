## Claim
Claim: "![image 54](media/85.jpg) The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'"

## Actions
```
web_search("Channel 12 Israel public opinion poll rape prisoner")
image_search("Channel 12 Israel poll soldier rape prisoner")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image is a doctored screenshot of a Channel 12 news bulletin. The original video, published on May 27, 2022, featured a question about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism. The altered image, which was shared on social media, shows a question about whether a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner. Channel 12 has debunked the false posts. Another article discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees, referencing a Channel 12 report.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://theintercept.com/2024/08/09/israel-prison-sde-teiman-palestinian-abuse-torture/): 
Content: The Intercept published an article that includes an image with the Channel 12 logo. ![image 13936](media/2025-08-31_17-02-1756659740-943874.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a doctored screenshot from Channel 12 news. The original video was about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism, not about soldiers raping prisoners. Channel 12 has debunked the false posts.


## Final Judgement
The image is a manipulated screenshot from Channel 12 news. The original broadcast featured a different question, and the claim presented is a fabrication.
