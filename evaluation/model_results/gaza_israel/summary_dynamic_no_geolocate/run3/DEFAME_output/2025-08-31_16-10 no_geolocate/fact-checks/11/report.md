## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a Hezbollah drone attack occurred on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties. However, the evidence does not mention that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in the attack. It does state that Herzi Halevi visited the site.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, as the attack did occur, but the assertion that Herzi Halevi was assassinated is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms that a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base occurred on October 13, 2024. However, the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in the attack is not supported by the evidence.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base did occur on October 13, 2024, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-attack-10-14-24-intl-hnk) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/), the evidence does not support the assertion that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in the attack.
