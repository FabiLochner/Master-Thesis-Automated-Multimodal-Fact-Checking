Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/23/middleeast/israel-intensifies-southern-gaza-offensive-intl): 
Content: CNN published an article on March 23, 2025, about Israel intensifying its offensive in southern Gaza. The article includes an image of a crowd at night. <image:13850>

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be fully verified. While there is evidence of Israeli attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, resulting in casualties, the provided evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim depicts that specific event. Sources like a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip) and a [UN News article](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461) confirm the attacks, but the image's origin remains unconfirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
