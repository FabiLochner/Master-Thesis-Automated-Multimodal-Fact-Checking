## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 42](media/69.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Syrian Archive published an article on July 18, 2025, about Israeli attacks on Syria between February and May 2025. The Security Council Report discusses Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, including a ground incursion into Daraa, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entering the town of Tasil in southern Syria. This article was posted on April 9, 2025.

The Jerusalem Post published several articles on April 3 and 4, 2025, discussing the ongoing conflict, including IDF strikes in Syria and Gaza, and clashes near Daraa. One article mentions the IDF killing several terrorists in southern Syria. The Jerusalem Post also included a photo of the Israel Air Force striking a Hamas weapons facility in Syria on February 9, 2025, which is the same image as the claim (![image 42](media/69.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts Israeli military forces. The Jerusalem Post used the same image in an article about IDF strikes in Syria. The Security Council Report mentions an IDF ground incursion into Daraa, including the town of Tasil. The Jerusalem Post also published an article on February 9, 2025, which is the same month mentioned in the claim.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely accurate.


## Final Judgement
The image is confirmed to be related to Israeli military forces. Multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post and the Security Council Report, mention IDF activities in the Daraa region, including the town of Tasil, and the same image is used in an article about IDF strikes in Syria. The timeframe aligns with the claim.

### Justification
The image depicts Israeli military forces, as confirmed by multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post, which used the same image in an article about IDF strikes in Syria.
