Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/survivors-of-israels-pager-attack-on-hezbollah-last-year-struggle-to-recover): 
Content: The PBS article, published on August 6, 2025, discusses an Israeli attack on Hezbollah using rigged pagers in Lebanon in 2024. <image:13508> The attack caused explosions in homes, offices, and shops.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/18/lebanon-exploding-pagers-harmed-hezbollah-civilians): 
Content: Human Rights Watch published an article on September 18, 2024, reporting that pagers exploded across Lebanon and parts of Syria on September 17, 2024, resulting in at least 12 deaths and 2,800 injuries. <image:12> is not in the article. The article includes a photograph of people outside a hospital emergency room in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 18, 2024.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows the aftermath of an explosion of a Hezbollah pager in Lebanon in September 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is not related to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon. The image is from an article about a toilet explosion in Noida, India, as indicated by the [reverse image search](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms). The web search confirms the Hezbollah pager explosions occurred in Lebanon in September 2024, but the image is not associated with those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
