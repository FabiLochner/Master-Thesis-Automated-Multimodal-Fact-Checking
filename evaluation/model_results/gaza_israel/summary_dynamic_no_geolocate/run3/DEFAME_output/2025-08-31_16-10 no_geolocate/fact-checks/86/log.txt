Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/us-bolsters-military-presence-in-middle-east-as-threat-of-regional-escalation-intensifies): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 3, 2024, stating that the U.S. military will deploy additional Navy cruisers, destroyers, and fighter jets to the Middle East. The Pentagon said the deployments are to improve U.S. force protection, increase support for the defense of Israel, and ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies. The article includes a file photo of a US Osprey landing on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea. <image:12890>

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image provided in the claim is of U.S. Navy ships and was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea, not in August 2024 en route to Lebanon. While there were reports of U.S. military deployments to the Middle East in August 2024, the image does not depict this. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
