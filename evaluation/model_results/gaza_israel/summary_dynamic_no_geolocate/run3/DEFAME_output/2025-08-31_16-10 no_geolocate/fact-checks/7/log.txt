Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that the Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are the first since late 2024, when Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes. The article mentions that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Red Sea crisis, including the timeline, attacks, military operations, and diplomacy. It mentions the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels, including the hijacking of the Galaxy Leader and attacks on the MV Maersk Hangzhou. The article also mentions the 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire. The article also mentions the 2024 Houthi drone attack on Israel, the 20 July 2024 Israeli attack on Yemen, the 29 September 2024 Israeli attacks on Yemen, the December 2024 Israeli airstrikes in Yemen, and the 26 December 2024 Israeli attack on Yemen. The article also mentions the March–May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen and the 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire. The article also mentions that on 6 May, US president Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council ([Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/)) and ABC News ([Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774)) indicates that Houthi attacks in international waters continued after the 2024 US presidential election, and the situation involved airstrikes and a pledge to stop attacks, not a final cessation of military operations.

So, the overall veracity is: false
