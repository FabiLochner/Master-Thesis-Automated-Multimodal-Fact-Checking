## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In July 2024, electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "free Palestine" and "escalate now" (![image 13](media/15.jpg)). The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism and the Montreal police are investigating. A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility.

The Montreal Gazette ([https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans)) and CBC News ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809)) reported on the incident. The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-812229](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-812229)) reported that the signs displayed "Globalize the intifada".

The Maple ([https://www.readthemaple.com/city-of-montreal-illegally-seized-pro-palestine-signs-activists-allege/](https://www.readthemaple.com/city-of-montreal-illegally-seized-pro-palestine-signs-activists-allege/)) discussed the removal of pro-Palestine signs by the City of Montreal.

The Montreal Gazette ([https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs)) reported on electronic roadwork billboards in Montreal displaying anti-Israel messages, including "Free Palestine" ![image 13](media/15.jpg), "Escalate Now," and "Globalize the Intifada." The mayor of Hampstead threatened legal action against Montreal's mayor, Valérie Plante, due to the messages. Montreal officials stated the signs were vandalized.


## Elaboration
The image in the claim shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" and "Escalate now." The evidence confirms that in July 2024, electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "free Palestine" and "escalate now" ([https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs)). However, the evidence indicates that the City of Montreal considered the signs to be the result of vandalism, and the mayor did not authorize them. Therefore, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate as the image does show a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" and "Escalate now" in July 2024. However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false, as the city considered the signs to be the result of vandalism. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" and "Escalate now" in July 2024. However, the city considered the signs to be the result of vandalism, and the mayor did not authorize them, contradicting the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante ([https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs)).
