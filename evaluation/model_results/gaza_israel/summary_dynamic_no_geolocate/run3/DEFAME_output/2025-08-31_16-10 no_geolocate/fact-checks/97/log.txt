The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While there were discussions about conscription and modifications to the Selective Service Act, the search results primarily focused on the US's diplomatic actions, such as vetoing UN resolutions and proposing ceasefires, without mentioning the draft being reinstituted. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
