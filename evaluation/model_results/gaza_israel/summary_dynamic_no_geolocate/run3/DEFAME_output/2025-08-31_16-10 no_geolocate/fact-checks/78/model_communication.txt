Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the case was 'very delicate'Image: Antoni Byszewski/Fotonews/Newspix/IMAGO

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, as he may attend the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. The article mentions an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. <image:1>

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend the event, and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend the event, and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

The article mentions an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. <image:1>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, as he may attend the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. The article mentions an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. <image:1>

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend the event, and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

    The heads of the US and Israeli spy agencies - the CIA and Mossad - are due to meet with the Qatari prime minister today in Doha, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an official who has been briefed on the talks.
    
    Qatar has been acting as a mediator between Israel and Hamas for ceasefire and hostage-release talks and the US and Egypt have also been leading negotiations to end the war.
    
    The talks follow the Israeli prime minister's office announcing earlier this week that the head of Mossad had been directed to head to Doha, following "meetings that were held in Cairo".
    
    This is an apparent reference to reports that an Egyptian delegation met with Hamas leaders there as part of efforts to resume negotiations.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, as he may attend the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. The article mentions an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. <image:1>

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend the event, and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. The evidence also indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack, calling it a "big mistake." However, the evidence does not state that Netanyahu left Israel or fled to Poland.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest, possibly related to an ICC warrant, if he attended the Auschwitz anniversary. However, the evidence does not mention any events from October 1, 2024, or an Iranian missile attack. The evidence also states that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

To verify the claim, information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any related events, such as an Iranian missile attack, would be needed.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”. 

**Bianca Carrera is a freelance writer and analyst specialising in Middle Eastern and North African politics, as well as environmental matters, at Sciences Po Paris. Some days later, the party also headed a [proposal to re-establish ties](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ca/mandat-2019-2023/accio-de-govern/el-consell-municipal/acords-del-plenari/35184)
 in a council plenary session. He made clear that the move was on his agenda, but associations claim they were not told it would be a priority within his mandate. 

The group that was behind Barcelona’s solidarity campaign with Palestine, ‘Prou Complicitat’, or ‘Enough Complicity’, told _The New Arab_ that Collboni’s Socialist Party later met with the Palestine solidarity movement.

“In this meeting, they acknowledged that their reaction to the suspension was hasty and that they overreacted. \[Getty\]

**Pro-Israel interest groups and the Spanish right**

ACOM was founded in 2004 by businessman David Hatchwell, and is now presided over by the CEO of the international insurance company AmTrust Europe, Angel Mas."

It was reported that former Barcelona Mayor, Ada Colau, [said this](https://www.thejc.com/news/world/barcelona-cuts-ties-with-israel-amid-war-with-hamas-sudg2kkf#:~:text=Colau%20said%3A%20%22It%20is%20not%20a%20war%2C%20it%20is%20genocide.%20We%20must%20not%20only%20denounce%20it%2C%20but%20act.%E2%80%9D)
 in November 2023 after the city council suspended institutional relations with the government of Israel. However, FC Barcelona is not mentioned in the [document published online](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/premsa/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CM231124-3.2-Text-transaccionat-BnC.pdf)

Football - La Liga Santander - FC Barcelona v Valencia - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - September 14, 2019 Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong celebrates scoring their second goal with Sergio Busquets and team mates. Reuters

**An Israeli soccer team said on Thursday it has called off a friendly match with Barcelona after the Spanish team declined to play in Jerusalem, a city that Palestinians want part of as their capital.**

Beitar Jerusalem FC, an Israeli Premier League club, had previously reached a tentative deal to host Barcelona on August 4, a person familiar with the planning told Reuters, although neither club had formally announced the match.

Beitar owner Moshe Hogeg said in a statement he had decided not to sign the contract on the match because "I understood that the price I would have to pay is to boycott Jerusalem ... to lend a hand to those who come out against Jerusalem".

####  [![The Business Standard Google News](/sites/all/themes/sloth/images/google_news.svg) Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMIivlQsw2ZKrAw?ceid=US:en&oc=3)

A Beitar spokesman said FC Barcelona had asked that the game be played in a city other than Jerusalem, whose eastern sector Israel captured in a 1967 Middle East war and annexed as its capital in a move not recognized internationally.

An FC Barcelona source told Reuters that the game had never been officially confirmed and that there was now no plan to hold it.

The Barca source declined to respond to Hogeg's remarks.

Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope will include the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Hogeg said he briefly considered holding the game in Tel Aviv before deciding against it.

"I'm not angry at Barcelona," he said. I don't want to inflame matters, but they weren't willing to sleep in Jerusalem or to visit Jerusalem either."

On Sunday, the Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted FC Barcelona President Joan Laporta as saying the club had not confirmed it would hold any friendly match in Jerusalem.

Barcelona had a history of actions in "clear defence of the rights and freedoms of all peoples of the earth," WAFA quoted Laporta as saying.

### Comments

While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective. "They are not part of this conflict that we have in the Middle East."

Moshe Lion, the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, told Israel's Army Radio: "They (Barcelona) were not willing to come to Jerusalem. Published comments are readers’ own views and The Business Standard does not endorse any of the readers’ comments.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that FC Barcelona has had interactions with Israeli representatives and has been involved in events related to Israel. The image in the claim shows a meeting with Israeli representatives. The evidence also mentions the ongoing Gaza war. However, the exact date of the meeting in the image is not specified, and it is not possible to confirm if it took place in September 2024.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of information about the date of the meeting.

BARCELONA (AP) — A flotilla of ships departed from Barcelona to the [Gaza Strip](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-offensive-gaza-city-ceasefire-2521a7370ab1cd32cbf28943cc8d542e)
 Sunday with humanitarian aid and activists on board in the largest attempt yet to break the long Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory by sea.

This comes as [Israel has stepped up its offensive on Gaza City](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-08-30-2025-807071aad1041e8f4d2bf9463361062d)
, limiting the deliveries of food and basic supplies in the north of the Palestinian territory. The almost 23-month war has killed more than 63,000 people, with at least 332 Palestinians dying of malnutrition, including 124 children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The maritime convoy of about 20 boats and delegations from 44 countries is claimed to be the largest attempt to date to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip by sea, which has now lasted 18 years. One of them, the Sirus, is more than 100 years old.

“It has been very clear that Israel has been continuously violating international law by either attacking, unlawfully intercepting the boats in international waters, and continuously preventing the humanitarian aid from coming in,” said Thunberg in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday.

The Global Sumud Flotilla will be the fourth attempt to break the maritime blockade so far this year. After the Madleen, the [Israeli military stopped another aid ship](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-blockade-activist-ship-seized-24c32eafd80d08a63e5bed8b83d5972f)
, the Handala, in late July, detained 21 international activists and reporters and seized its cargo, including baby formula, food and medicine, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition.

The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893)) published an article on February 17, 2023, about FC Barcelona's president inviting Israeli embassy representatives to a soccer match, including a photo of the flag exchange on February 16, 2023 (<image:1>). The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/analysis/why-barcelona-reversed-its-decision-cut-ties-israel](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/why-barcelona-reversed-its-decision-cut-ties-israel)) published an article on September 11, 2023, discussing Barcelona's decision to reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel (<image:52>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that FC Barcelona has had interactions with Israeli representatives and has been involved in events related to Israel. The image in the claim shows a meeting with Israeli representatives. The evidence also mentions the ongoing Gaza war. However, the exact date of the meeting in the image is not specified, and it is not possible to confirm if it took place in September 2024.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of information about the date of the meeting.

The i24news.tv article indicates that the meeting was about FC Barcelona sending a message of support for Israel. However, the exact date of the meeting is still not specified.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of information about the date of the meeting.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

“Israel was also pursuing \[a\] political goal with this act, aiming to disrupt the first day of the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prioritized strengthening peace and stability in the region, and enhancing cooperation and constructive engagement with international community,” Iravani added.

Earlier today, US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”

Wood said that although the US was not involved with Israel’s response on July 30 in Lebanon, “there is no doubt absolutely none that Hezbollah was responsible for this attack, which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah.”

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in the past day, following the killing by Israel of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. <image:13377>

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).  

The Hamas leader had arrived in Tehran earlier this week and had attended events at the parliament and an exhibition near Milad Tower before retiring to his residence.

Neither Hamas nor Iranian officials have yet commented publicly on the incident. <image:13377>

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS
=============================================================

![Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh attends a meeting with members of international media in Gazaa](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/442230)

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/holcoursepopup1.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)). Another article states that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals, including Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by reports, but the information is unconfirmed and comes from potentially biased sources. While there are reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone and the use of cell phone tracking, the specific role of WhatsApp in tracking him is not definitively confirmed. Therefore, there is not enough information to verify the claim. `not enough information`

Revealed: Israeli military creating ChatGPT-like tool using vast collection of Palestinian surveillance data
============================================================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

The powerful new AI model is designed to analyze intercepted communications – but experts say such systems can exacerbate biases and are prone to making mistakes

Israel’s military surveillance agency has used a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian communications to build a powerful artificial intelligence tool similar to ChatGPT that it hopes will transform its spying capabilities, an investigation by the Guardian can reveal.

The joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found Unit 8200 trained the AI model to understand spoken Arabic using large volumes of telephone conversations and text messages, obtained through its extensive surveillance of the occupied territories.

According to sources familiar with the project, the unit began building the model to create a sophisticated chatbot-like tool capable of answering questions about people it is monitoring and providing insights into the massive volumes of surveillance data it collects.

The elite eavesdropping agency, comparable in its capabilities with the US National Security Agency (NSA), accelerated its development of the system after the start of the war in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 in October 2023. I have more tools to know what every person in the West Bank is doing.”

Details of the new model’s scale sheds light on Unit 8200’s large-scale retention of the content of intercepted communications, enabled by what current and former Israeli and western intelligence officials described as its blanket surveillance of Palestinian telecommunications.

The project also illustrates how Unit 8200, like many spy agencies around the world, is seeking to harness advances in AI to perform complex analytical tasks and make sense of the huge volumes of information they routinely collect, which increasingly defy human processing alone.

A signal intelligence-gathering installation of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit responsible for collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, located on an observation point on the Israeli-Lebanese border near Rosh HaNikra crossing. “And ultimately these guesses can end up being used to incriminate people.”

A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the new LLM, but said the military “deploys various intelligence methods to identify and thwart terrorist activity by hostile organisations in the Middle East”.

A vast pool of Arabic-language communications
---------------------------------------------

Unit 8200 has developed an array of AI-powered tools in recent years. Now one of the world’s most widely used LLMs, ChatGPT is underpinned by so-called “foundation model”, a general-purpose AI trained on immense volumes of data and capable of responding to complex queries.

Initially, Israeli military intelligence struggled to build a model on this scale. Sayedoff said in his presentation the team building the LLM “focused only on the dialects that hate us”.

!An Israeli soldier from the special intelligence unit 8200 taking part in a Cyber Defense Challenge event in which teams compete against each other in stopping malicious hackers from invading vital infrastructures in a simulation game. The UK’s spy agencies [are also developing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/01/uk-intelligence-spy-agencies-relax-burdensome-laws-ai-data-bpds)
 their own LLMs, which it is also said to be training with open-source datasets.

But several former US and UK security officials said Israel’s intelligence community appeared to be taking greater risks than its closest allies when integrating novel AI-based systems into intelligence analysis.

One former western spy chief said Israeli military intelligence’s extensive collection of the content of Palestinian communications allowed it to use AI in ways “that would not be acceptable” among intelligence agencies in countries with stronger oversight over the use of surveillance powers and handling of sensitive personal data.

Campbell, from Human Rights Watch, said using surveillance material to train an AI model was “invasive and incompatible with human rights”, and that as an occupying power Israel is obligated to protect Palestinians’ privacy rights. “We’re talking about highly personal data taken from people who are not suspected of a crime, being used to train a tool that could then help establish suspicion,” he added.

Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights and advocacy group, said Palestinians have “become subjects in Israel’s laboratory to develop these techniques and weaponise AI, all for the purpose of maintaining \[an\] apartheid and occupation regime where these technologies are being used to dominate a people, to control their lives”.

Several current and former Israeli intelligence officers familiar with smaller-scale machine learning models used by Unit 8200 – precursors to the foundation model – said AI made the blanket surveillance of Palestinians more effective as a form of control, particularly in the West Bank where they said it has contributed to a greater number of arrests.

Two of the sources said the models helped the IDF automatically analyse intercepted phone conversations by identifying Palestinians expressing anger at the occupation or desires to attack soldiers or people living in illegal settlements. “Mistakes are going to be made, and some of those mistakes may have very serious consequences,” she added.

In February, the [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108)
 AI was likely used by intelligence officers to help select a target in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in November 2023 that killed four people, including three teenage girls.

## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions

web_search("Israeli intelligence Hamas leader WhatsApp tracking")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel, according to a CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) and a CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) also mentions the assassination.

The sources do not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:13377>

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements. ([https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)). Another article states that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals, including Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

[![A technologist with the Israeli military's Matzpen operational data and applications unit works at his station, at an Israel Defense Force base in Ramat Gan, Israel, June 11, 2023. The Israeli military reportedly uses surveillance technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and other digital tools to help determine who or what to attack in Gaza and when.

Human Rights Watch found that four digital tools that the Israeli military is using in Gaza use faulty data and inexact approximations to inform military actions. Some tools rely on machine learning, which is the use of computerized systems that can draw inferences from data and recognize patterns without explicit instructions.

It has not been possible to document when and where these digital tools are being used or the extent to which these tools have been used in conjunction with other methods of information and intelligence collection. Based on reports, Israeli military officers are responsible for setting the threshold beyond which an individual can be marked as a target subject to attack.

The military has acknowledged the existence of a tool like Lavender [in very general terms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-defence-forces-response-to-claims-about-use-of-lavender-ai-database-in-gaza)
, calling it a “database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources.”

A presentation and book by two Israeli officers provide important technical details. **What is** “**Where’s Daddy?**” **and how does it work?**

Based on media reports, “Where’s Daddy” is a tool that uses mobile phone location tracking to notify Israeli military operators when people who have been marked as military targets enter a specific location – according to reports, often a family home – where they can be attacked. A mobile phone is not a reliable proxy for a human target, as people, especially in conflict zones, may change numbers or devices during an emergency where access to networks and devices may frequently and suddenly change.

In addition, the most common methods for tracking cell phone location are through [triangulating cell tower locations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221568410_Accuracy_Characterization_of_Cell_Tower_Localization)
, called cell site location information, or through gaining access to a [mobile phone's GPS data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638960/)

 [tools](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes)
 in their operations in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military’s use of these digital tools risk Israeli forces violating international humanitarian law, in particular the laws of war concerning distinction between military targets and civilians, and the need to take all feasible precautions before an attack to minimize civilian harm.

Human Rights Watch research indicates that the tools apparently rely on ongoing and systematic Israeli surveillance of all Palestinian residents of Gaza, including with data collected prior to the current hostilities in a manner that is incompatible with international human rights law."

Content: "“The Israeli Lavender system, supported by artificial intelligence, identifies Palestinians by tracking their communications via WhatsApp or the groups they join.”

The mention of Israel’s use of WhatsApp data in Abraham’s reporting also caught the attention last month of Paul Biggar, founder of Tech for [Palestine](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/palestine)
.

“There’s a lot wrong with this—I’m in plenty of WhatsApp groups with strangers, neighbors, and in the carnage in Gaza you bet people are making groups to connect,” [wrote](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/meta-and-lavender/)

The Palestinian digital rights group Sada Social on Saturday [called for](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 an investigation into Israel’s alleged use of WhatsApp user data to target Palestinians with its AI system, Lavender.

The group, which is affiliated with the Al Jazeera Media Institute and Access Now, accused Meta, which owns WhatsApp, of fueling “the ‘Lavender’ artificial intelligence system used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinian individuals within the [Gaza](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/gaza)
 enclave.”

As _Common Dreams_ [reported](https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-ai-targets)
 in April, the [Israel](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/israel)
 Defense Forces has relied on AI systems including Lavender to target people Israel believes to be Hamas members.

At _+972 Magazine_, Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham [wrote](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)
 that a current commander of an elite Israeli intelligence unit pushed for the use of AI to choose targets in Gaza. No social network should be providing this sort of information about its users to countries engaging in ‘pre-crime.'”

Others have pointed out that Israel may have acquired WhatsApp data through means other than a leak by Meta.

Journalist Marc Owen Jones said the question of “Meta’s potential role in this is important,” but noted that informants, captured devices, and spyware could be used by Israel to gain Palestinian users’ WhatsApp data.

> The question about Lavender using Whatsapp groups for their targeting, and Meta’s potential role in this is important, but it’s also very important to remember the number of methods Israel can use to gain access to that information without Meta.

> 1) Firstly. The commander wrote in a guide book to create the system that “hundreds and thousands” of features can be used to select targets, “such as being in a WhatsApp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.”

Sada Social asserted that it had found the Lavender system uses WhatsApp data to select targets.

“The reports monitored by the Sada Social Center indicate that one of the inputs to the ‘Lavender’ system relies on data collected from WhatsApp groups containing names of Palestinians or activists who are wanted by ‘Israel,'” [said](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 the group in a press release. Meta has been promoting WhatsApp as a ‘private’ social network, including ‘end-to-end’ encryption of messages.”

“Providing this data as input for Lavender undermines their claim that WhatsApp is a private messaging app,” he wrote. Informants,…

Bahraini activist Esra’a Al Shafei, founder of Majal.org, [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 the _Middle East Monitor_ that the reports that WhatsApp user data has been used by the IDF’s AI machine demonstrate why privacy advocates warn against the collection and storage of metadata, “particularly for apps like WhatsApp, which falsely advertise their product as fully private.”

“Even though WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, and claims to not have any backdoors to any government, the metadata alone is sufficient to expose detailed information about users, especially if the user’s phone number is attached to other Meta products and related activities,” Al Shafei said. “This is why the IDF could plausibly utilize metadata to track and locate WhatsApp users.”

While Meta and WhatsApp may not necessarily be collaborating with Israel, she said, “by the very act of collecting this information, they’re making themselves vulnerable to abuse and intrusive external surveillance.”

In turn, “by using WhatsApp, people are risking their lives,” she added.

A WhatsApp spokesperson [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 _Anadolu_ last month that “WhatsApp has no backdoors and we do not provide bulk information to any government,” adding that “Meta has provided consistent transparency reports and those include the limited circumstances when WhatsApp information has been requested.”

Al Shafei said Meta must “fully investigate” how WhatsApp’s metadata may be used “to track, harm, or kill its users throughout Palestine.”

“WhatsApp is used by billions of people and these users have a right to know what the dangers are in using the app,” she said, “or what WhatsApp and Meta will do to proactively protect them from such misuse.”

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel, according to a CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) and a CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) also mentions the assassination.

The sources do not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:13377>

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements. ([https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)). Another article states that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals, including Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

By Bruna Horvath and [Kevin Collier](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/kevin-collier-ncpn1110251)

Around 90 users of Meta’s chat service WhatsApp are suspected to have been targets of a spyware campaign conducted by an Israeli spyware company called Paragon Solutions, a WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News. 

The spokesperson said that the attack targeted a number of users including journalists and members of civil society “across over two dozen countries, particularly in Europe.” They added that Paragon Solutions has used a [vector](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/attack-vector)
, a method to illegally access a network, to target the users and that “the vector involved using groups and sending a malicious PDF file.” The spokesperson added that the company has “successfully disrupted this exploitation vector.”

WhatsApp has sent Paragon Solutions a cease-and-desist letter following the series of attempted attacks. For an optimal experience visit our site on another browser.

 through WhatsApp chat and have been [provided information on how to protect themselves from spyware](https://faq.whatsapp.com/641700318302674/?helpref=hc_fnav)
. Paragon Solutions did not reply to an immediate request for comment.

“These attackers look for vulnerabilities in apps or the mobile phone operating system or try to trick users into clicking on malicious links or downloading malware — all to gain unauthorized access that can damage your phone, steal your information and put your privacy and security at risk,” a WhatsApp help page on spyware reads.

Francesco Cancellato, the editor-in-chief of the Italian online newspaper Fanpage.it, [published an article](https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/giornalisti-presi-di-mira-dallo-spyware-israeliano-paragon-spiato-anche-il-direttore-di-fanpage-it/)
 revealing that he was one of the journalists who was targeted by the attack. In the message that WhatsApp sent to Cancellato notifying him that he might have been affected, the chat service said that it had stopped the attack in December. 

The spokesperson said that the company’s security team and Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity research lab based out of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, helped track the spyware campaign.

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told NBC News that a hack such as this one has the ability to “turn a telephone into a spy in your pocket.” 

“When a phone is infected, the operator of that spyware can typically do anything that you as a user can do on the phone,” Scott-Railton said. “They can access your encrypted messages, your chats, look at your photographs, browse your messages, listen to your voice memos, look at your notes, read your contacts, get your passwords, and also do some number of things that you can’t do, like silently activating the microphone to listen to a conversation you might be having in a room, or turning on the camera.”

WhatsApp worked with Citizen Lab in 2019 when the chat service [sued the Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/facebook-sues-israel-s-nso-group-over-alleged-whatsapp-hack-n1073511)
, accusing it of aiding government spies to hack the phones of over a thousand users, including journalists, diplomats, senior government officials and political dissidents. judge [ruled in favor of WhatsApp](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-judge-finds-israels-nso-group-liable-hacking-whatsapp-lawsuit-2024-12-21/)

. It is still believed that Paragon Solutions operates in Israel.

Natalia Krapiva, senior tech-legal counsel at the internet access nonprofit Access Now, says that the nonprofit’s research has found that these attacks on “journalists and other civil society actors are becoming common.”

“Last time WhatsApp notified NSO victims in 2019, we have seen a flood of lawsuits, sanctions, and other consequences for this industry,” Krapiva said. In December, a U.S."

An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:13377>

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware): 
Content: "Like other spyware makers, Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks.

Experts said the targeting was a “zero-click” attack, which means targets would not have had to click on any malicious links to be infected.

WhatsApp declined to disclose where the journalists and members of civil society were based, including whether they were based in the US.

Paragon has a US office in Chantilly, Virginia. WhatsApp will continue to protect people’s ability to communicate privately,” a company spokesperson said.

Paragon Solutions declined to comment.

A person close to the company told the Guardian that Paragon had 35 government customers, that all of them could be considered democratic, and that Paragon did not do business with countries, including some democracies, that have previously been accused of abusing spyware. WhatsApp said it could say with “confidence” that Paragon was linked to this targeting.

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks and identifies digital threats against civil society, said Citizen Lab provided WhatsApp with some information that helped the company understand the vector that was used against the company’s users.

The group is expected to publish a report in the future that will provide more details about the alleged targeting.

WhatsApp announced the news just weeks after a judge in California ruled in the company’s favor in a landmark case against NSO Group, the high-profile spyware maker that in 2021 was placed by the Biden administration on a commerce department blacklist. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

WhatsApp says journalists and civil society members were targets of Israeli spyware
===================================================================================

This article is more than 6 months old

Messaging app said it had ‘high confidence’ some users were targeted and ‘possibly compromised’ by Paragon Solutions spyware

Nearly 100 journalists and other members of civil society using [WhatsApp](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp)
, the popular messaging app owned by Meta, were targeted by spyware owned by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli maker of hacking software, the company alleged on Friday.

The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted and “possibly compromised”.

It is not clear who was behind the attack. The Trump administration has revoked dozens of the Biden administration’s executive orders in its first two weeks in office, but the 2023 order, which prohibited the use of spyware that posed a risk to national security remains in effect.

WhatsApp said it had sent Paragon a “cease and desist” letter and that it was exploring its legal options. WhatsApp said the alleged attacks had been disrupted in December and that it was not clear how long the targets may have been under threat.

The company is currently notifying victims of the alleged hacking, who will be contacted by WhatsApp.

“WhatsApp has disrupted a spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted a number of users including journalists and members of civil society. Once a phone is infected with Graphite, the operator of the spyware has total access to the phone, including being able to read messages that are sent via encrypted applications like WhatsApp and Signal.

The company, which was founded by the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, has been the subject of media reports in [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 recently, after it was reported that the group was sold to a US private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, for $900m.

Reports suggested the deal had not yet received full regulatory approval in Israel. Paragon is not listed among the company’s investments on its website.

“For some time Paragon has had the reputation of a ‘better’ spyware company not implicated in obvious abuses, but WhatsApp’s recent revelations suggest otherwise."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence uses various methods to track individuals, including the use of AI to analyze intercepted communications and mobile phone location tracking ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance), [https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)). Furthermore, there are reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings, potentially through informants, captured devices, and spyware ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)).

Specifically, the evidence indicates that Israeli companies have developed spyware to target WhatsApp users ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal), [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)). While there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings suggest that it is plausible.

The claim is therefore plausible, but not definitively proven.

The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence uses various methods to track individuals, including the use of AI to analyze intercepted communications and mobile phone location tracking ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance), [https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)). Furthermore, there are reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings, potentially through informants, captured devices, and spyware ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)).

Specifically, the evidence indicates that Israeli companies have developed spyware to target WhatsApp users ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal), [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)). While there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings suggest that it is plausible.

The claim is therefore plausible, but not definitively proven.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence uses various methods, including AI and mobile phone tracking, and has developed spyware to target WhatsApp users. While there is no direct confirmation that Haniyeh was tracked through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings make it plausible. However, the reports are unconfirmed, and further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used. `not enough information`

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel, according to a CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) and a CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) also mentions the assassination.

The sources do not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:13377>

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements. ([https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)). Another article states that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals, including Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

Your Message Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

The attack was carried out by Israel, according to a CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) and a CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) also mentions the assassination.

The sources do not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:13377>

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

While there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings suggest that it is plausible.

The claim is therefore plausible, but not definitively proven.

### Geopolitical Report ISSN 2785-2598 Volume 44 Issue 8  
SpecialEurasia OSINT Unit

### Executive Background

According to Iranian and Palestinian sources, Israel allegedly assassinated Hamas’s political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran. This incident has further inflamed the already volatile situation, raising fears of a widespread escalation that could engulf multiple countries and lead to severe humanitarian crises.

### Contextual Analysis

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran signifies a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. This rhetoric implies a possible escalation in retaliatory measures against Israeli targets, both domestically and potentially internationally.

**Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination poses a significant threat to the fragile ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas**. This event, which occurred after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, underscores Tel Aviv’s strategic capacity to neutralise high-value targets linked to Iran-supported militant groups.

Historical context, such as the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus and the subsequent [Tehran’s retaliatory missile and drone strikes](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/04/14/iran-attack-israel-report/)
, suggests that **this escalation could provoke a powerful response from Iran**. The success of this situation hinges on the mutual willingness of both parties to participate in meaningful dialogue and make compromises, which is presently difficult to fathom.

### Conclusion

Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination significantly impacts the regional geopolitical landscape, necessitating close monitoring of subsequent developments and potential international interventions. **_Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran; Hamas blames Israel._**
2. **_Iran’s inability to prevent the attack questions its territorial control and security._**

### Background Information

Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of _Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya_ (Hamas), was killed in Tehran alongside his bodyguard after a targeted strike [on his residence](https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779)
. Its precision and the significant security breach it represented within the Iranian capital marked the assassination.

**Haniyeh, a significant figure in Palestinian politics, acquired recognition for his pragmatic approach to negotiations and his efforts towards achieving a ceasefire**. This incident signifies **a major violation of Iranian security**, demonstrating Israel’s ability and readiness to conduct prominent operations in hostile territories.

The precise strike on Haniyeh’s residence, coinciding with the Iranian presidential inauguration, underscores the **profound symbolic and strategic significance of this assassination**. The assassination poses a threat to Tehran’s credibility and has the potential to weaken its influence among regional allies, who may question its capacity to offer protection and help.

**The assassination of Haniyeh in Gaza and the West Bank may motivate residents to persevere in their fight against Israel,** since Tel Aviv killed the person who was conducting the ceasefire’s negotiations.

Although described as a terrorist and a state’s enemy by Tel Aviv, Middle Eastern experts have often described Haniyeh as a moderate leader within Hamas, advocating for pragmatic approaches to conflict resolution."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel, according to a CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) and a CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) also mentions the assassination.

The sources do not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:13377>

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)). Another article states that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals, including Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on March 6, 2025, discussing how the Israeli military is creating a ChatGPT-like tool using Palestinian surveillance data, and that Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit, is using AI to analyze intercepted communications ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance)).

Truthout.org published an article on May 21, 2024, discussing reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings of Palestinians, mentioning the "Lavender" AI system, which allegedly identifies Palestinians by tracking their communications via WhatsApp or the groups they join ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)). The article also mentions that Israel may acquire WhatsApp data through informants, captured devices, and spyware. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the use of spyware, developed by Israeli companies, to target WhatsApp users. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal)) details the Pegasus scandal, where spyware was used to target journalists, activists, and government officials. NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)) report on Paragon Solutions, another Israeli company, targeting WhatsApp users with spyware, including journalists and civil society members. <image:13377> <image:13957>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence uses various methods to track individuals, including the use of AI to analyze intercepted communications and mobile phone location tracking ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance), [https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)). Furthermore, there are reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings, potentially through informants, captured devices, and spyware ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)).

Specifically, the evidence indicates that Israeli companies have developed spyware to target WhatsApp users ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal), [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)). While there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings suggest that it is plausible.

The claim is therefore plausible, but not definitively proven.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides further support for the claim. The Tehran Times reported that Ismail Haniyeh's son stated that his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). This, combined with previous evidence of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance and targeted killings, increases the plausibility of the claim.

NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)) report on Paragon Solutions, another Israeli company, targeting WhatsApp users with spyware, including journalists and civil society members. <image:13377> <image:13957>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence uses various methods to track individuals, including the use of AI to analyze intercepted communications and mobile phone location tracking ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance), [https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)). Furthermore, there are reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings, potentially through informants, captured devices, and spyware ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)).

Specifically, the evidence indicates that Israeli companies have developed spyware to target WhatsApp users ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal), [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)). While there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings suggest that it is plausible.

The claim is therefore plausible, but not definitively proven.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh WhatsApp data assassination evidence")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Tehran Times reported that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp shortly before his assassination, suggesting WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). The SpecialEurasia OSINT Unit reported on the assassination, but did not mention WhatsApp ([https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides further support for the claim. The Tehran Times reported that Ismail Haniyeh's son stated that his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). This, combined with previous evidence of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance and targeted killings, increases the plausibility of the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for his assassination on July 31, 2024, is plausible but not definitively proven. While there are unconfirmed reports suggesting spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking, and evidence of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance, there is no direct confirmation. However, the Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination, increasing the plausibility.

`false`

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

Humans of Gaza: 9-year-old Mayar and 6-year-old Bilal, inseparable siblings
===========================================================================

Saturday, 25 November 2023 6:54 PM  **\[ Last Update: Saturday, 25 November 2023 6:54 PM \]**

! He didn't let grief come in the way of discharging his professional duties.

Darling of her parents, 9-year-old Mayar was the closest confidant of her brother Bilal.

She was a few years older than Bilal, but the siblings shared a beautiful bond. An Israeli airstrike cut short their young lives together.

The girl with an infectious smile was killed with her little brother and mother in an Israeli airstrike on their home in the besieged Gaza Strip on October 23.

The father was not at home at the time. The siblings would always be seen together - playing, studying, walking hand in hand.

The grief-stricken father, who had pinned high hopes on his children, was forced by the occupation to lower their lifeless bodies into a grave, bidding them farewell with a heavy heart and teary eyes.

Reporters Without Borders has described Gaza as the “cemetery of journalists.” However, for journalists reporting from Gaza, the tragedy extends to their entire families, including children.

Mohammed Abu Hatab, a journalist working with Palestine TV, was killed with his family as Israel bombed his home in Gaza’s Khan Younis, in the south of the territory, on November 3.

Palestine TV said that the deliberate Israeli attacks on reporters “is a bloody message to terrorize Palestinian journalists,” intended to stop them from “conveying the suffering of the Palestinian people and exposing the crimes of the occupation”.

In late October, the family of Wael Dahdouh, Al Jazeera Arabic bureau chief in Gaza, was killed in an Israeli air raid. The images of their funeral became viral on social media.

Journalists and their families in Gaza have also been receiving threatening calls from the Israeli military and spies, warning them of unwanted repercussions for laying bare the regime’s crimes.

“Another threat by occupation to not go to Gaza City,” Motaz Azaiza, a prominent Gaza journalist, wrote on his Instagram handle while sharing the recording of a phone call on November 24.

**By Humaira Ahad**

Mayar wanted to become a journalist like her father. He was busy covering the war for Palestine TV.

Mayar excelled in her studies and had big dreams for her future. She wanted to show Gaza and the plight of her people to the world.

From a young age, the 9-year-old had learned the art of storytelling and being forthright from her journalist father as she grew up watching him cover the news every single day.

Bilal, on the other hand, appeared to be reserved, most of the time clinging to his sister whom he loved dearly."

Israeli airstrikes kill girl along with her dream to become journalist

Mayar and Bilal are two children of Palestine TV correspondent Nidal Hamida. Like thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza the Israeli brutal airstrikes ended up their lives along with their dreams. 

Mayar was a few years older than her brother Bilal. They were though attached to each other always playing together and having fun at home while enjoying the love of their parents. 

All those who knew Mayar said she was a smart girl as she excelled in her school subjects and was dreaming of becoming a journalist just like her father but the Israeli hideous bombardment ended her dream by killing her along with her brother Bilal and their mother in October 2023. 

Their father who has been covering the Israeli aggression on Gaza as many other journalists was left alone to continue his job with grief and pain for his great loss and concern over losing more of his family members. 

Since October 7 Israel has been waging a heinous genocide in Gaza Strip via air ground and sea attacks resulting in more than 40000 martyrs wounded and missing people. 

“We Are Not Numbers” is a series that reviews part of the available stories of some Palestinian martyrs who have fallen in the Israeli aggression on Gaza.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed on July 6, 2024, at Al-Jaoni UN school. However, the evidence indicates that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli airstrike on October 23, 2023, in their home in the Gaza Strip.

The claim is therefore inaccurate regarding the date and location of the children's death.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News reported on November 20, 2024, that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza (<image:1>). The Security Council Report, published on November 19, 2024, discussed a draft resolution on the war in Gaza, mentioning the US's potential veto.

The United Nations website also reported on a Security Council meeting on November 20, 2024, where a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages failed due to a US veto. The resolution was supported by 14 Council members.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence focuses on the US's actions within the UN Security Council regarding the war in Gaza, specifically its veto of resolutions calling for a ceasefire.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

 avoiding the potential constraint on militia service that it can only be used "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")

 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)
 Selective Service System registration for men on their 18th birthdays coupled with debate that the current all-male registration should be [expanded](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4730560-senate-democrats-require-women-draft/)
 to include all Americans has generated [public rumors](https://thedispatch.com/article/mandatory-registration-for-the-draft-isnt-new-contrary-to-social-media-posts/)
 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)
 conscription has generated fear of returning to the [Vietnam](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/us-military-draft-iran-selective-service-system)
\-era [draft](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-military-draft-rumors-swirl-after-iran-attacks-1865063)
. At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)
 among an apathetic American populace.

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

US vetoes Security Council resolution demanding permanent ceasefire in Gaza
===========================================================================

**By** **Vibhu Mishra**

4 June 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

A draft resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza failed to pass in the UN Security Council on Wednesday after the United States cast its veto – blocking the initiative backed by all ten elected members of the Council.

The text, co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia – collectively known as the E-10 – received 14 votes in favour, with the US casting the lone vote against.

As one of the council’s five permanent members, the US holds veto power – a negative vote that automatically blocks any resolution from going forward.

Had it been adopted, the draft would have demanded “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” to be respected by all parties.

Release all hostages
--------------------

The text reaffirmed the Council’s earlier call for the “**immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups**.”

The draft also expressed grave concern over the “**catastrophic humanitarian situation**” in Gaza – following months of almost total Israeli aid blockade – including the risk of famine, highlighted by recent assessments by international food security experts.

It reaffirmed the obligation of all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.

Resume flow of aid
------------------

In addition to a ceasefire, the draft resolution demanded the “**immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions**” on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza, calling for safe and unhindered access for UN and humanitarian partners across the enclave.

It also urged the restoration of essential services, in accordance with humanitarian principles and prior [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 resolutions.

The text voiced support for ongoing mediation efforts led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States to revive the phased ceasefire framework outlined in resolution 2735 (2024), which envisions a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of all remains, full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, and the start of a long-term reconstruction plan.

Draft resolution unacceptable: United States
--------------------------------------------

Speaking ahead of the vote, acting US Representative Dorothy Shea described the draft resolution as “unacceptable”. As Secretary \[Marco\] Rubio has said: ‘If an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire’.” 

‘The world is watching’
-----------------------

The failure of the resolution comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with UN agencies warning of the total collapse of health services, growing displacement, and a rising death toll around the new privatized US-Israel led aid distribution system which bypasses established agencies.

“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said UN relief chief Tom Fletcher earlier on Wednesday.

 Print [Email](mailto:?subject=US vetoes Security Council resolution demanding permanent ceasefire in Gaza&body=https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164056 "Share this via Email") Shea said, stressing, “Hamas and other terrorists must have no future in Gaza.  

“US opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise – it is unacceptable for what it does say, it is unacceptable for what it does not say, and it is unacceptable for the manner in which it has been advanced,” she said.

“The United States has been clear,” she continued, “we would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza.”

She added that Hamas has rejected numerous ceasefire proposals, including one over the weekend that would have provided a pathway to end the conflict and release the remaining hostages.

“We cannot allow the Security Council to award Hamas’ intransigence,” Ms."

Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding.
    
    Nick Schifrin is in New York now and joins us with more.
    
    So, Nick, what's in this proposal and could it be accepted by both sides?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    Well, Geoff, as you said, Israel has accepted this proposal, which would be a 60-day cease-fire of the war in Gaza. We call on President Trump to pressure Netanyahu and Hamas.
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    There are American and Israeli officials, Geoff, who do believe and tell me that if President Trump were to publicly pressure Netanyahu to end the war, Netanyahu would agree.
    
    But, for now, until Hamas agrees to this draft we have been talking about or Israel changes its policy and agrees to end the war in full, the war goes on.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Nick Schifrin in New York tonight.
    
    Nick, thank you for that reporting.
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    Thank you.

Nick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding. Hamas would also return the bodies of 18 dead Israeli hostages.
    
    In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian detainees, including more than 100 serving life sentences. But so long as the war continues, Israel's military vows to take over 75 percent of Gaza, pushing Gazans into small areas in the south, what Israel, Geoff, calls sterile zones.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    And how is Israel responding to the cease-fire proposal?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    As we have discussed multiple times, Geoff, Israeli society is split. You see there some scuffled with police last night after they broke into the ruling Likud headquarters.
    
    And thousands of Israelis continue to fill Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to listen to hostage families argue that diplomacy is the only way forward. They may contain errors._

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Today, Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. But this would not, as you said, end the war or require Israel to withdraw from Gaza."

The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence focuses on the US's actions within the UN Security Council regarding the war in Gaza, specifically its veto of resolutions calling for a ceasefire.

The US has blocked a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council - the fourth time it has used its veto power during the conflict to shield its ally, Israel.

Fourteen of the 15 Council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza "must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released".

Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document "abandoned" the necessity for there to be "a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages".

Critics of the veto sharply rebuked the US, with France saying it "deeply regretted" the move.

The UNSC is composed of five permanent members which have veto power - and 10 which are elected.

This group proposed the draft resolution which also "rejected any effort to starve Palestinians".

The vote was held as the UN warned that Palestinians were "facing diminishing conditions for survival" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because [virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo)
.

Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza.

The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals.

Ambassador Wood said passing the resolution would have sent a "dangerous message" to Hamas, the armed group at war with Israel, that "there's no need to come back to the negotiating table".

Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said the resolution "was not a path to peace, it was a roadmap to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed".

"Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto," he added.

Hamas, meanwhile, accused the US of being "directly responsible" for Israel's "genocidal war" in Gaza.

Reacting to the veto, China's ambassador said people could not help but ask: "Do Palestinian lives mean nothing?"

France said international humanitarian law was being trampled and the only response should have been an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

The UK said it wanted to end the war, stop the suffering in Gaza and secure the immediate release of all hostages.

But the harshest criticism of the US came from outside the Council doors.

Human Rights Watch's (HRW) UN director, Louis Charbonneau, accused Washington of "once again" using its veto power "to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza".

Israel rejects the accusations.

The current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 251 into Gaza as hostages.

More than 43,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News reported on November 20, 2024, that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza (<image:1>). The Security Council Report, published on November 19, 2024, discussed a draft resolution on the war in Gaza, mentioning the US's potential veto.

The United Nations website also reported on a Security Council meeting on November 20, 2024, where a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages failed due to a US veto. The resolution was supported by 14 Council members.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence focuses on the US's actions within the UN Security Council regarding the war in Gaza, specifically its veto of resolutions calling for a ceasefire.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses conscription in the United States, including its history and mentions a 2024 meeting memo that suggested modifications to the Selective Service Act, including registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States) <image:1>, <image:2>

An article from War on the Rocks, published on August 8, 2024, discusses the possibility of a draft in the US, mentioning that conscription is being discussed among US allies and adversaries. [https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/) <image:1>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were discussions and considerations regarding the draft in the US in 2024. The Wikipedia article mentions modifications to the Selective Service Act, and the War on the Rocks article discusses the possibility of a draft. However, neither source confirms that the draft was reinstituted for the Israel-Hamas war.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results focus on the US's diplomatic actions regarding the Israel-Hamas war, such as vetoing UN resolutions and proposing ceasefires. There is no mention of the US reinstituting the draft.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there were discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act and the possibility of a draft in the US in 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft for the Israel-Hamas war. The provided sources focus on the US's diplomatic actions and discussions about conscription, but do not confirm the claim.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While there were discussions about conscription and modifications to the Selective Service Act, the search results primarily focused on the US's diplomatic actions, such as vetoing UN resolutions and proposing ceasefires, without mentioning the draft being reinstituted. Therefore, the claim is false.
