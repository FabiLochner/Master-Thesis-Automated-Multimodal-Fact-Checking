The article mentions that the City of Montreal has been ordered to pay damages in the past for similar incidents.

Useful result: From [Source](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs): 
Content: The Montreal Gazette published an article on July 26, 2024, reporting that electronic roadwork billboards in Montreal displayed anti-Israel messages, including "Free Palestine," "Escalate Now," and "Globalize the Intifada." <image:13> The mayor of Hampstead threatened legal action against Montreal's mayor, Valérie Plante, due to the messages. Montreal officials stated the signs were vandalized, with unauthorized messages overriding the original city messages.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" and "Escalate now" in July 2024. However, the city considered the signs to be the result of vandalism, and the mayor did not authorize them, contradicting the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante ([https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
