Content: The search result from krcrtv.com, published on January 28, 2025, reports that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza." <image:13561> The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the expense a waste of taxpayer money. DOGE head Elon Musk stated that the money might have ended up with Hamas.

The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims), report that there is no evidence to support the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was allocated for condoms in Gaza. USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East during the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023.

So, the overall veracity is: false
