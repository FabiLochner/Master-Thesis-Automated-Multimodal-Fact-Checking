The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the use of genetic information is regulated, DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Evidence from Harvard University ([Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html), [Source](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)) and Nature.com ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)) indicates that DNA tests are used for purposes like determining Jewish identity for immigration and that there are restrictions on the use of genetic information, but not a ban on testing.

So, the overall veracity is: false
