## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a drone attack occurred on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel. However, the provided sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216)) state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and that there were no injuries.

The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is not supported by the evidence. The provided sources do not mention Yair Netanyahu. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, but the evidence does not support the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack. The provided sources state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.

The claim is demonstrably false because the evidence from multiple reliable sources contradicts the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), the sources state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu, thus contradicting the claim that he was killed in the attack.
