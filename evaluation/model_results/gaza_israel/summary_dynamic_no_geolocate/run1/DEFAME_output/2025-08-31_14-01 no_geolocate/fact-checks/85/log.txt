Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/): 
Content: The article from Mondoweiss, published on August 19, 2024, discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll was published by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies. The article also mentions a Channel 12 report.

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, did not ask the question presented in the image, but rather asked about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism. The claim is therefore demonstrably false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
