## Elaboration
Based on the evidence, the claim is false. CNN fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it.

Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim, stating the funds were intended for Mozambique, not Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates the claim is false. CNN and other sources debunked the claim, stating there was no evidence to support it and that the funds were not allocated for condoms in Gaza. Elon Musk also retracted the claim. `false`
