Useful result: From [Source](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/german-tv-agrees-to-air-anti-semitism-documentary-following-cries-of-censorship-6-1-2017): Found exact image on website with title: German TV agrees to air anti-Semitism documentary following cries ...
Content: The World Jewish Congress published an article on June 19, 2017, about a German TV documentary on European anti-Semitism. The article includes the image in the claim (<image:6999>). The image shows a group of people with Palestinian flags and a swastika.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/tags/adam-milstein): Found exact image on website with title: Adam Milstein | The Jerusalem Post
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article by Adam Milstein on July 27, 2023, discussing antisemitism in Europe. The article includes an image of a swastika on the base of the Statue de la République in Paris during a protest in support of Palestinians. <image:546154>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris from July 26, 2014, as confirmed by a reverse image search, which contradicts the claim that it is related to the 2024 French parliamentary elections. The image predates the election by a decade and is unrelated to the event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
