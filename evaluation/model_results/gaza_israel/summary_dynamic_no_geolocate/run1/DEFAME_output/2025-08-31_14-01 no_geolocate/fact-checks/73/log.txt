The claim '<image:45> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image in the claim was fact-checked as false by NDTV, and the search results show that the image was taken in December 2024. While there have been Israeli actions in Syria, including airstrikes in Damascus, there is no evidence to support the claim that the Israeli army reached Damascus in December 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
