## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IHRA working definition of antisemitism was adopted on May 26, 2016, and has been adopted by numerous countries and institutions. The definition includes examples of antisemitism, such as holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) website provides the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. The search results do not mention any amendments to the definition in March 2025 or the inclusion of "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel." ![image 11090](media/2025-08-31_07-40-1756626013-149433.jpg), ![image 11093](media/2025-08-31_07-40-1756626015-218852.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, adopted in May 2016. One source, from ReformJudaism.org, notes that the definition is a "working definition" and therefore subject to change. The article was published on August 26, 2025, and mentions the Nexus Document and the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, which were written in response to the IHRA definition.

Another source mentions that by March 2025, the definition had been endorsed by 44 UN member states. This source does not mention the World Jewish Congress or any amendment to the definition in March 2025.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results do not mention any amendments to the IHRA definition of antisemitism in March 2025 that include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel." While the definition is subject to change, there is no evidence of the WJC amending it as described.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that the IHRA working definition of antisemitism was adopted in 2016 and has been adopted by numerous countries and institutions. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) website provides the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. However, the search results do not mention any amendments to the definition in March 2025 or the inclusion of "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel."

The claim is demonstrably false because the provided evidence does not support the claim. There is no mention of the WJC amending the IHRA definition in March 2025 to include the specified statement. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The provided evidence, including searches on the World Jewish Congress and the IHRA definition, does not support the assertion that the definition was amended in March 2025 to include the specified statement. The IHRA definition was adopted in 2016, and while subject to change, there is no evidence of the WJC making the claimed amendment.
