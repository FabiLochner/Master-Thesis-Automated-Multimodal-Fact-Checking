### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an "Iran Update" on September 13, 2024, discussing the ongoing conflict between Israel and various groups. The report mentions an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, which the US Embassy in Baghdad assessed was likely conducted by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. The report also mentions that Iranian-backed militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah, have conducted attacks into northern Israel. ![image 5911](media/2025-08-29_19-32-1756495975-895292.jpg) The IDF killed three senior PIJ fighters in a drone strike in the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm on September 11. The report also mentions that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired rockets targeting Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor on September 13. ![image 5913](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495983-781166.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image (![image 11](media/13.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image has been identified as being from an explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha, New Jersey, in April 2011, and another source mentions an explosion in Northern California at a fireworks warehouse on July 2, 2025. The web search revealed an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, but no image was provided.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not from an attack on a US facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. The image is from an explosion that occurred in 2011 and 2025. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is not from an attack on a US facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Reverse image search results show the image is from an explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha, New Jersey, in April 2011, and another source mentions an explosion in Northern California at a fireworks warehouse on July 2, 2025. The web search revealed an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, but no image was provided.
