### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Houthi militia.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) also reports on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. ![image 2528](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009983-275614.jpg) The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also reports on the Houthi drone strike in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a Houthi drone attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided image does not show Israelis fleeing the airport. The image shows people waiting in line at what appears to be an airport.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate because the image does not depict Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack. The image shows people waiting in line at an airport.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv did occur on July 19, 2024, as reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), the provided image does not depict people fleeing the airport. Instead, it shows people waiting in line at an airport.
