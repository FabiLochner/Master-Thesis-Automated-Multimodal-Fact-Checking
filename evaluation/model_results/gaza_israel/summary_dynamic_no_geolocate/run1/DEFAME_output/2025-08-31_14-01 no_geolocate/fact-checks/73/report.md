## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an image of an Israeli tank (![image 12816](media/2025-08-31_14-55-1756652134-835704.jpg)). NDTV fact-checked a claim that Israeli tanks were spotted outside Damascus, labeling the claim as "FALSE" (![image 12817](media/2025-08-31_14-55-1756652135-033572.jpg)). The image in the claim is the same as the one in the search result. Al Jazeera published an article on December 8, 2024, about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights, including an image of an Israeli tank (![image 12818](media/2025-08-31_14-55-1756652135-447119.jpg)).

The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is false.
