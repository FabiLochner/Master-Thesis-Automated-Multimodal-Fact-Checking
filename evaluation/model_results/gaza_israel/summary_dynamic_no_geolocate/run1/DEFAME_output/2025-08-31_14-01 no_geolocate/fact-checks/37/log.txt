Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sarahmarchwianyphotography.com/blog/strawberry-picking-in-the-triad/): 
Content: The search result from Sarah Marchwiany Photography shows a baby in a strawberry field. <image:12661>

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While a Hezbollah rocket did strike a soccer field in Israel on July 27, 2024, killing 12 children, the image in question is of a baby in a strawberry field, and there is no evidence to connect the image to the event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
