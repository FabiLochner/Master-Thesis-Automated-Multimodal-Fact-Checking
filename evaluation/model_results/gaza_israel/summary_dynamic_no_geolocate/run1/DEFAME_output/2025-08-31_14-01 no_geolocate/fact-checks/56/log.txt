Content: NPR published an article on September 18, 2024, discussing a series of explosions in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah members. The explosions were caused by wireless devices, including pagers. The article includes images of the aftermath of the explosions, including an ambulance and damaged vehicles. <image:12713>, <image:12714>, <image:12716>.

The claim '<image:31> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While explosions did occur in Lebanon in September 2024, as reported by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/g-s1-23577/pagers-devices-explode-hezbollah-lebanon-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/g-s1-23577/pagers-devices-explode-hezbollah-lebanon-israel)), the explosions were caused by wireless devices, including pagers, and there is no evidence to support the claim that an iPhone exploded.

So, the overall veracity is: false
