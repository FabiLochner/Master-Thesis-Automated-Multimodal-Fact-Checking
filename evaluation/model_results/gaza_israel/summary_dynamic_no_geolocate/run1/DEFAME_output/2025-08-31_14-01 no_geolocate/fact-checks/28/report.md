## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On April 2, 2025, the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) reported that the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, expressed Israel's commitment to strengthening ties with Ethiopia (<image:i>). Fana Media Corporation S.C. also reported on the same day that the ambassador emphasized strengthening economic and social ties between the two countries (![image 5051](media/2025-08-23_01-29-1755912546-305304.jpg)).

The Wikipedia article on Ethiopiaâ€“Israel relations discusses the diplomatic relations between the two countries, including the presence of embassies in each other's capitals and the history of their relationship, including military assistance and a break in diplomatic relations in 1973 (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference on the Rwandan genocide in Addis Ababa, according to reports from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/african-union-israel-ambassador-evicted-rwanda-genocide-f22033810dc019bd632deed7bb9fab25](https://apnews.com/article/african-union-israel-ambassador-evicted-rwanda-genocide-f22033810dc019bd632deed7bb9fab25)), The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/)), and Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)). Neguise has been the ambassador since August 2024. The ejection was at the request of AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Youssouf. Israel regained observer status at the AU in 2021. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference in Addis Ababa. However, this event occurred in the context of a conference on the Rwandan genocide, not as a formal expulsion by the Ethiopian government. Furthermore, the evidence shows that on April 2, 2025, the ambassador expressed a commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries.

The claim that Ethiopia expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the ambassador was present in April 2025 and actively working to strengthen ties.

To verify the claim, information about whether the Ethiopian government expelled the ambassador in April 2025 is missing.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that the Israeli ambassador was present in April 2025 and expressed a commitment to strengthening ties. While the ambassador was expelled from a conference, this was not a formal expulsion by the Ethiopian government. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference, this was not a formal expulsion by the Ethiopian government. Furthermore, on April 2, 2025, the ambassador expressed a commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries, as reported by the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) and Fana Media Corporation S.C.
