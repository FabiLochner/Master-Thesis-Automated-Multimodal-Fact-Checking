## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Anadolu Agency reported on June 30, 2024, about a 70-year-old Palestinian woman attacked by an Israeli army dog in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, which had a camera on its back (<image:k>). The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) reported on July 7, 2024, about an incident in May 2024 where an Israeli military dog attacked an elderly Palestinian woman while she was asleep, biting her shoulder (![image 10860](media/2025-08-30_07-36-1756539397-178754.jpg)). The PCHR article also mentions a video of the attack captured by a camera mounted on the dog.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were attacks by Israeli army dogs on Palestinian women in June 2024. One incident occurred in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, and another in May 2024, where an elderly woman was bitten on the shoulder. The latter incident was captured on video by a camera mounted on the dog. However, the provided image ![image 65](media/99.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs attacked Palestinian women in June 2024. However, the image's authenticity cannot be verified. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The web search found articles about similar incidents, but none of them included the image. Therefore, the claim that the image is authentic cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While there were reports of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women in June 2024, the image in question could not be verified as authentic. Reverse image searches and other searches did not yield any results confirming the image's authenticity, despite confirming similar incidents, including one captured on video by a camera mounted on a dog.
