## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website boughtbyzionism.org ([https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit](https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit)) discusses Vice President Kamala Harris's support for Israel, referencing an endorsement by the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America on July 22, 2024, and includes an image of protestors ![image 1552](media/2025-07-20_10-36-1753007798-062130.jpg). Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/)) published an article on July 21, 2024, stating that Harris's support for Israel has been as strong as Biden's ![image 1560](media/2025-07-20_10-36-1753007807-426714.jpg).

USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, mentioning her calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and her reaffirmation of the Biden administration's stance that Israel has the right to defend itself <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that on July 22, 2024, Kamala Harris's support for Israel was a topic of discussion. The website boughtbyzionism.org ([https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit](https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit)) references an endorsement by the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America on that date. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, nor does it mention Benjamin Netanyahu's visit.

The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates Harris's strong support for Israel, but it does not provide the specific quote. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, discusses her statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, but it does not include the claimed statement either.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the available evidence. The exact statement and the context of Netanyahu's visit are not confirmed.

NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/25/nx-s1-5048285/harris-gaza-war](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/25/nx-s1-5048285/harris-gaza-war)) reported on July 25, 2024, that Harris met with Netanyahu and stated her "unwavering commitment to Israel" ![image 12687](media/2025-08-31_14-36-1756650967-593652.jpg), ![image 12692](media/2025-08-31_14-36-1756650972-871419.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 2024. During the meeting, Harris expressed her "unwavering commitment to Israel." However, the evidence does not confirm that Harris made the specific statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc)) from August 23, 2024, discusses Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Hamas war, including her meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and quotes her saying, "Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself." ![image 1591](media/2025-07-20_10-37-1753007866-175696.jpg), ![image 1592](media/2025-07-20_10-37-1753007866-255379.jpg), ![image 1590](media/2025-07-20_10-37-1753007865-928880.jpg). Al-Monitor ([https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/what-kamala-harris-has-said-israel-gaza-war](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/what-kamala-harris-has-said-israel-gaza-war)) published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Harris's statements and includes a photo of Harris on July 22, 2024 ![image 1597](media/2025-07-20_10-37-1753007869-434807.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some relevant information. The Al-Monitor article from July 23, 2024, includes a photo of Harris from July 22, 2024. However, the evidence does not contain the exact quote "Our support for Israel will continue" from July 22, 2024. The NPR article from August 23, 2024, quotes Harris saying, "Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself."


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed Israel. However, the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, is not found in the provided evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed Israel, the specific statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, is not supported by the provided evidence. The search results show that Harris made other statements regarding Israel's right to defend itself, but not the exact quote in question.
