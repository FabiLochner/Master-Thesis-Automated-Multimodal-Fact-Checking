Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pattayamail.com/thailandnews/jewish-community-in-thailand-israeli-tourists-speak-out-amid-pai-controversy-clarify-their-visit-and-dispel-misconceptions-491671): Found exact image on website with title: Jewish Community in Thailand - Israeli tourists speak out amid Pai ...
Content: The search result is from Pattaya Mail, published on August 6, 2025. It discusses a controversy surrounding Israeli tourists in Pai, Thailand. The article includes an interview with four Israeli tourists who clarified their visit was for tourism, not to claim land or compete with local jobs. They also addressed concerns about Chabad centers and apologized for disturbances caused by a small group of Israelis. The article includes images of the tourists. <image:3463>

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. The image depicts Israelis in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources, including the Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2962860/surge-in-unruly-israeli-tourists-causes-alarm-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2962860/surge-in-unruly-israeli-tourists-causes-alarm-in-northern-thailands-pai)). However, the evidence does not support the assertion that they are "settlers" who have stopped fighting wars.

So, the overall veracity is: false
