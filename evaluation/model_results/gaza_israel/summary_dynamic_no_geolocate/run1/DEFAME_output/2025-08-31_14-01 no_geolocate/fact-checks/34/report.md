## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 23](media/34.jpg)) shows a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)), The Globe and Mail ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-massive-fire-breaks-out-at-oil-refinery-south-of-tehran/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-massive-fire-breaks-out-at-oil-refinery-south-of-tehran/)), and The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/massive-fire-breaks-out-oil-refinery-near-irans-capital](https://www.newarab.com/news/massive-fire-breaks-out-oil-refinery-near-irans-capital)) all published articles on June 2, 2021, about the fire. The fire was caused by a liquefied gas line leak and explosion.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple news sources, including CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran)), reported on Israeli airstrikes against military targets in Iran on October 26, 2024, in retaliation for attacks against Israel. ![image 23](media/34.jpg), ![image 1274](media/2025-07-20_10-21-1753006880-192978.jpg), ![image 1275](media/2025-07-20_10-21-1753006880-499663.jpg), ![image 1277](media/2025-07-20_10-21-1753006890-931473.jpg), ![image 1282](media/2025-07-20_10-21-1753006900-477700.jpg)

The articles mention explosions in Tehran and nearby Karaj, with the IDF stating the attacks were a response to previous attacks. The CNN article also mentions that four Iranian military members died in the attack.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. The image shows a fire near Tehran, but it is not from October 26, 2024. The image is from a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran on June 2, 2021. However, the web search confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on October 26, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is from a fire in 2021, not from the alleged bombing in 2024. While there were indeed Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on October 26, 2024, the image is not related to those events.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran from June 2, 2021, as reported by The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)). While there were Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on October 26, 2024, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), the image is unrelated to those events.
