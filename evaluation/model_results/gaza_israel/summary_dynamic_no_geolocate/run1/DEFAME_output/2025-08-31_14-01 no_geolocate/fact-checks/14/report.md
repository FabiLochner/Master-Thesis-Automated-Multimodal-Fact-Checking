## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the explosions of Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon on September 17, 2024. One article, published on October 11, 2024, in the Lieber Institute, mentions that the explosions occurred in Lebanon and Syria, and that media reports suggest Israel was responsible for the explosions. The BBC News reported on September 18, 2024, that the explosions killed nine people and injured thousands. Human Rights Watch reported at least 12 deaths and 2,800 injuries. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the attacks.

The Human Rights Watch article includes an image of an exploded toilet (![image 12](media/14.jpg)). The BBC News article includes images of the aftermath of the explosions (![image 12558](media/2025-08-31_14-18-1756649926-761952.jpg), ![image 12561](media/2025-08-31_14-18-1756649927-347788.jpg), ![image 12559](media/2025-08-31_14-18-1756649926-916788.jpg)).
