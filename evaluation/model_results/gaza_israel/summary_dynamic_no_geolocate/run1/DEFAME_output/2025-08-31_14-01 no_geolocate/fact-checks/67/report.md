Another article from Madamasr.com ([https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) discusses a meeting between Turkish and Syrian officials in May 2025 and talks between Turkey and Israel in April 2025.

A RUSI article ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)) discusses the relationship between Turkey and Israel, mentioning a state visit in March 2022 and Israeli airstrikes in March. It also mentions Turkey's export and import restrictions against Israel in May 2024 (<image:k>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia page about the Israeli invasion of Syria (2024â€“present), which mentions a timeline of events including clashes and foreign involvement, including Israeli and Turkish involvement in 2025 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))). An article in The Armenian Weekly discusses Syria's second civil war and mentions Turkish military intervention in northern Syria in March 2025 <image:k> ([https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)).

The Times of Israel published an article about an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria and establish a hotline, with a photo of troops operating in southern Syria on May 5, 2025 ![image 12811](media/2025-08-31_14-53-1756652025-084063.jpg) ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turkey-said-to-agree-to-prevent-clashes-in-syria-establish-hotline/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was involved in Syrian affairs in 2025, including military intervention and diplomatic talks. The evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria and meetings between Turkish and US officials in May 2025. There is also mention of Turkish military intervention in northern Syria in March 2025. Furthermore, an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria was reached, with a photo of troops operating in southern Syria on May 5, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a JINSA report from April 23, 2025, detailing Erdogan's anti-Israel rhetoric, including a quote from March 30, 2025, where he prayed for Israel's destruction. The report also lists hostile statements and actions by Turkish officials in 2025, including Foreign Minister Fidan's statement on April 10, 2025, regarding Israel's actions in Syria, and Erdogan's statements on February 13, 2025, and January 15, 2025, concerning Israel's actions. The report also mentions Israeli airstrikes in late March and early April targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over.

Additionally, a PBS News article from July 23, 2025, states that Syria requested Turkey's support to strengthen its defense capabilities following sectarian violence and Israeli intervention (![image 12815](media/2025-08-31_14-54-1756652060-419746.jpg)). The article mentions that Turkey was working towards providing training, advisory services, and technical support. It also mentions that tensions escalated in southern Syria, leading to Israeli airstrikes. The article also discusses the U.S. position and Turkey's stance on the SDF. The article mentions that in April, Israel struck five cities in Syria.


## Elaboration
The evidence now provides more specific information. The JINSA report from April 23, 2025, details Erdogan's anti-Israel rhetoric, including a quote from March 30, 2025, where he prayed for Israel's destruction. The report also lists hostile statements and actions by Turkish officials in 2025, including Foreign Minister Fidan's statement on April 10, 2025, regarding Israel's actions in Syria, and Erdogan's statements on February 13, 2025, and January 15, 2025, concerning Israel's actions.

While the evidence confirms Erdogan's anti-Israel stance and mentions his statements in March 2025, it does not explicitly state that he urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. However, the evidence does show that Turkey was critical of Israel's actions in Syria.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as Erdogan made anti-Israel statements in March 2025, but the evidence does not confirm that he urged the U.S. to control Israel.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Erdogan made anti-Israel statements in March 2025 and that Turkey was critical of Israel's actions in Syria. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Based on the evidence, while Turkish President Erdogan made anti-Israel statements in March 2025 and Turkey was critical of Israel's actions in Syria, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that he urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The JINSA report ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)) details Erdogan's anti-Israel rhetoric, but does not mention any such urging.
