_‚ÄúTremendo golpe a Iran, se confirma que el comandante de la Fuerza Quds del CGRI de Ir√°n, general Esmail Qaani, se encuentra a salvo en Israel‚Ä¶ Ahora se puede revelar que era un activo israel√≠ que proporcion√≥ inteligencia que condujo a la eliminaci√≥n del l√≠der de Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, y de los l√≠deres de Hezbol√°, Nasrallah y Safieddine..

Separately on Thursday, head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy¬†Rear Admiral Shahram Irani described the country's¬†maritime power and defense capabilities as stronger than ever before.

‚ÄúToday, our enemies view the armed forces of the¬†Navy as a superpower,‚Äù he said in Bandar Abbas¬†during a meeting with the families of the personnel of the 86th Naval Group which¬†traveled¬†the world for 236 days between September 2022 and May 2023.¬†

Irani attributed the success of the mission to a¬†combination of the personnel's expertise and the patience and endurance of the families of the comrades, emphasizing that families play a crucial role in boosting the morale of the personnel during long-term international missions.

Irani said the international community views Iran's Navy¬†on par with the naval forces¬†of a superpower.

‚ÄúThe efforts of my comrades have become evident to everyone in the country, the region, and the world, bringing honor and pride to our dear Iran,‚Äù he said.

Your Email is not currect ! Qa'ani: US, Israel 'powerless in practice' against Iran, resistance
========================================================================

Thursday, 10 April 2025 5:17 PM¬†¬†**\[¬†Last Update:¬†Friday, 11 April 2025 9:19 AM¬†\]**

! This is our strength,‚Äù Brigadier General Esmail Qa'ani said on Thursday.¬†

Last year, Iran hit military and intelligence targets inside the Israeli occupied territories¬†with missile salvos in April and October.¬†Iranian officials have underscored that the country only deployed a fraction of its firepower during the dual reprisal.

While Western military experts have also warned that¬†future attacks could be still more complex and use an even greater number of missiles, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) last week¬†unveiled a new underground missile "megacity".

It was unveiled after US¬†President Donald Trump¬†threatened Iran with¬†bombing if it doesn‚Äôt submit to American demands. *   [ ]

Gen. (Photo by EPA-EFE).

**The commander of Iran's¬†Quds Force says the US and Israel, with all their hype and hoopla,¬†are "powerless in practice" against Iran and resistance groups.**¬†

‚ÄúThey cannot even comprehend why our missiles accurately hit their targets. Qa'ani on Thursday¬†emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and domestic production.

He gave special plaudits to the resistance groups in the region¬†‚Äúfor having resisted with the least resources against the enemy‚Äôs advanced equipment‚Äù.

"As we saw in Lebanon and Yemen, the resistance¬†has dealt the greatest blows to the enemy with the least resources,‚Äù he said.¬†

Qa'ani highlighted the unique characteristics of the Resistance Front, saying "the essence of resistance is that anyone who fights it only makes it stronger."

‚ÄúYemeni youths who could not even reach the Zionist regime with their weapons¬†at the beginning of the war have increased the range of their missiles by 600 to 700 kilometers in a single year,‚Äù he said.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis kind of progress is unprecedented anywhere in the world,‚Äù General Qa'ani said, adding "the resources available to the Resistance Front today are the result of domestic efforts and innovations".

According to Ahmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group,¬†the US¬†is wrong to believe that airstrikes can compel Yemenis to back down.¬†

‚ÄúTheir logic is shaped by years of war; they see resilience as a form of strength and are driven to prove they are not easily deterred,‚Äù CNN quoted him as saying.

If¬†anything, they may actually be relishing US¬†strikes, the broadcaster said.¬†Their operations¬†are a ‚Äúdirect answer to their prayers to have a war with the US,‚Äù Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at Chatham House, told CNN.

Since mid-March, Yemeni forces have launched a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US¬†navy ships in solidarity with the Palestinians who are subject to daily massacres and other atrocities in Gaza and the West Bank."

Qaani has led the [Quds Force](https://www.ynetnews.com/topics/Quds_Force)
‚Äîthe external operations arm of Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)‚Äîsince 2020, following the U.S. Iranian operatives under Quds Force command have attempted to assassinate Israeli diplomats and envoys in countries like Thailand, Georgia, India, Azerbaijan, Turkey and others.

Qaani has long been viewed as a less charismatic and more low-profile figure than Soleimani. Wearing civilian clothes and a black baseball cap, the Quds Force chief appeared in good health. Iranian media offered no explanation for his disappearance or his whereabouts during the war, fueling further speculation.

Under his leadership, the force has continued supporting proxy militias across the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq‚Äîwhat officials often refer to as Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúring of fire‚Äù surrounding Israel.

The Quds Force has also been tied to terror attacks abroad, including the 2012 bombing of an Israeli tourist bus in Burgas, Bulgaria, which killed five Israelis. Still, Israeli and Western analysts believed he was a key target in the opening stages of Israel‚Äôs recent Operation Rising Lion.

On June 13, The New York Times reported‚Äîbased on unnamed sources‚Äîthat Qaani had been killed in an Israeli strike alongside other senior Iranian military officials. That report was never officially confirmed and his reappearance Tuesday proves it was inaccurate.

This isn't the first time Qaani has vanished from public view under suspicious circumstances."

According to a fact-check published on April 1, 2025, by Enlace Jud√≠o ([https://www.enlacejudio.com/fact-check/es-falso-que-el-general-irani-email-qaani-este-en-israel/](https://www.enlacejudio.com/fact-check/es-falso-que-el-general-irani-email-qaani-este-en-israel/)), the claim that Esmail Qaani was in Israel was an April Fool's Day joke. The article states that Qaani was last seen in Tehran. <image:11631>, <image:11634>

Press TV ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/04/10/745914/Iran-IRGC-Esmail-Qaani-Resistance-Front-missiles-precision-US-Israel-Gaza-Yemen-navy-Shahram-Irani](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/04/10/745914/Iran-IRGC-Esmail-Qaani-Resistance-Front-missiles-precision-US-Israel-Gaza-Yemen-navy-Shahram-Irani)) reported on April 10, 2025, that Qaani discussed the US and Israel's powerlessness against Iran and resistance groups. <image:11640> The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/esmail-qaani/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/esmail-qaani/)) published articles about Qaani, including reports from October 2024 about his status and a June 2025 report about a funeral in Tehran. <image:k>, <image:l>, <image:m>, <image:n>, <image:o>, <image:j>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani is the commander of the IRGC Quds Force since 2020, according to his Wikipedia article, which also mentions EU sanctions against him in May 2024. The article does not mention Qaani fleeing Iran or being in Israel. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) <image:k>

Ynetnews.com reported that Qaani reappeared in Tehran on June 24, 2025, after a 12-day disappearance, dispelling rumors of his death. ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe)) <image:12796>, <image:12793> The Jerusalem Post reported on June 25, 2025, that Qaani was seen at a rally in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The claim is demonstrably false. A fact-check from Enlace Jud√≠o ([https://www.enlacejudio.com/fact-check/es-falso-que-el-general-irani-email-qaani-este-en-israel/](https://www.enlacejudio.com/fact-check/es-falso-que-el-general-irani-email-qaani-este-en-israel/)) explicitly states that the claim was an April Fool's Day joke. Furthermore, multiple sources, including Press TV ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/04/10/745914/Iran-IRGC-Esmail-Qaani-Resistance-Front-missiles-precision-US-Israel-Gaza-Yemen-navy-Shahram-Irani](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/04/10/745914/Iran-IRGC-Esmail-Qaani-Resistance-Front-missiles-precision-US-Israel-Gaza-Yemen-navy-Shahram-Irani)), Ynetnews.com ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe)), and The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902)), provide evidence of Qaani's presence in Tehran during April and June 2025.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The evidence indicates that the claim originated as an April Fool's Day joke and is contradicted by multiple sources reporting Qaani's presence in Tehran. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

    26 September 2024
    

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that‚Äôs what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (¬£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/)
 is calling on Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 to fire his country‚Äôs ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy‚Äôs [visit to an ammunition plant](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.

The Republican speaker‚Äôs demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy [addressed the United Nations](https://apnews.com/video/war-and-unrest-ukraine-government-ukraine-russia-government-russia-eae042530895412f9447f6c70f7f27c1)
 in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the [war effort](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 before [meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489)
.

‚ÄúThe tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,‚Äù Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.

Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.

An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.

Joining for the visit were the state‚Äôs Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district‚Äôs Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden‚Äôs hometown.

The speaker‚Äôs stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war ‚Äî even sitting as a guest in the House visitor‚Äôs gallery during pivotal speeches ‚Äî comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.

While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine ‚Äúcontinues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,‚Äù noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are ‚Äúdead‚Äù and the country itself ‚Äúdemolished,‚Äù raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.

Later Johnson, who said he won‚Äôt be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador ‚Äúcrossed the line‚Äù and the situation requires ‚Äúimmediate attention and action.‚Äù

Zelenskyy visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-75a9ca2e3be09578c65f1198ba5b72e5)
 to thank the workers who are producing one of the [most critically needed munitions](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)
 for [his country‚Äôs fight](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 to fend off Russian ground forces.

The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture [155 mm artillery shells](https://apnews.com/article/155mm-howitzer-ukraine-ammunition-russia-7d966c85046b73db2b013f93c51af2a5)
 and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.

‚ÄúIt is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,‚Äù Zelenskyy wrote on X.

‚ÄúThanks to people like these ‚Äî in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries ‚Äî who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.‚Äù

Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.‚Äôs NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.

Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he [visited Utah](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-governors-c777901001422bbc5e0885a1824a67c9)
 to speak at the National Governor‚Äôs Association and was welcomed by the state‚Äôs Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group‚Äôs outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah‚Äôs congressional delegation, all Republicans.

The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

‚ÄúThe Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris‚Äôs presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,‚Äù he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State ‚Äúconducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.‚Äù The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, ‚Äúwhere they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,‚Äù the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. ‚ÄúHe really messed up,‚Äù said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.

However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy‚Äôs visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.

‚ÄúIf President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that‚Äôs who the people in their wisdom elected,‚Äù he said.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: ‚ÄúFor those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here‚Äôs the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans‚Äù. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children‚Äù.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match.

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was ‚Äú[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
‚Äù.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine‚Äôs war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote ‚ÄúGlory to Ukraine‚Äù on one shell and ‚ÄúThanks for Support‚Äù on another, both referencing Ukraine‚Äôs war with Russia and not Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy‚Äôs visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine‚Äôs official government website.

‚ÄúThe plant‚Äôs capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine‚Äôs needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,‚Äù the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine‚Äôs ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy‚Äôs handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine‚Äôs war with Russia or Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

#### [Ukrainian President Zelenskyy: 'It is so difficult to lose people... Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden‚Äôs hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom ‚Äì from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk ‚Äì with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro‚Äôs](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‚Äòradical‚Äô. ‚Äì locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick ‚Äì was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase ‚ÄúGlory to Ukraine.‚Äù Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

Five potential conflicts: Which could turn nuclear? There‚Äôs innocent on both sides.‚Äù

The backlash against Zelenskyy‚Äôs visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy‚Äôs remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine‚Äôs long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. ‚ÄúWe need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,‚Äù Graham remarked.

! ‚ÄúWe are taking the necessary measures and have delivered the required messages.‚Äù He added that the Syrian Democratic Force‚Äôs (SDF) understanding with Damascus requires a ‚Äújoint establishment of a new Syria,‚Äù while emphasizing that Turkey maintains ties with other Kurdish groups open to cooperation.

Fidan also addressed comments by Turkish President Recep Erdogan, saying Ankara would not hesitate to act if threatened. <image:12233>

US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan within an informal meeting of The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) foreign ministers in Antalya, on May 15, 2025. Speaking to TGRT television, he criticized Israel‚Äôs involvement in Syria and voiced opposition to attempts at ethnic division under the guise of ‚Äúpreserving national identity.‚Äù

‚ÄúSyria is next to us, and any unrest there directly affects us,‚Äù Fidan said. Abdulkadir Selvi, a journalist close to the government, wrote in H√ºrriyet that US Special Representative for Syria Tom Barrack has adopted ‚Äúa softer tone.‚Äù Barrack, who once insisted on ‚Äúone nation, one people, one army, and one Syria,‚Äù has reportedly floated the idea of a ‚Äúlooser arrangement.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis stance by the US ambassador has caused concern in Ankara,‚Äù Selvi wrote, suggesting the shift may signal changes in Washington‚Äôs Syria policy.

**Regional Tensions Over Minority Demands**

Selvi also reported that Israel has pressed the US administration to secure privileges for Druze communities [under its influence in Syria](https://levant24.com/tag/hijri/)
. He claimed the SDF and affiliated groups are using those demands as leverage to seek similar concessions.

Amid these competing pressures, Abdi has resisted full integration into the Syrian army despite the March 10 agreement and calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. (AFP)

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said developments in Syria remain a critical concern for Ankara, warning that any unrest directly impacts Turkey. Joe Wilson, centered on integrating the forces into the Syrian state through a decentralized model.

A source from the autonomous administration (AANES) told ANHA that negotiations with Damascus face obstacles but remain ongoing."

Content: "‚ÄúWith some international and local powers now adopting federal or decentralized models, Israel believes the time is right to apply military pressure to consolidate this model, particularly in the south, as a first step toward sharing influence and ensuring secure borders to strengthen influence in the northeast with the Syrian Defense Forces.‚Äù

Aware of the [fragility](https://snhr.org/blog/2025/03/11/803-individuals-extrajudicially-killed-between-march-6-10-2025/)
 that Sharaa‚Äôs government faces from the multiplicity of actors vying for control, however, Turkey has worked to strengthen the central government by using its own political card with Kurdish political factions to try to bring a close to any fragmentation of the Syrian state, even if it sees Erdogan drop a long held ideological mainstay.

Underlining Ankara‚Äôs seriousness, the first foreign visit to Syria after the fall of Assad came from Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin in December. ‚ÄúI believe that it is still a little early to talk about the dissolution of the forces in Syria because we have one demand, which is the establishment of a decentralized authority for the Kurds in northern Syria,‚Äù the SDF military commander says.¬†

Nearly three months after the agreement was signed, Turkey‚Äôs [patience](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/290520251)
 was wearing thin.

In a meeting between Sharaa and Erdogan on May 24, the two sides discussed the formulation of a common vision to end ‚Äúthe ongoing threat‚Äù posed by the Kurdish forces to Syria‚Äôs territorial integrity and Turkey‚Äôs national security, through direct field and security coordination, says the source close to the Turkish president.

Speaking after a round of technical talks in Baku in April between the Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan tried to downplay what was on everyone‚Äôs mind.

With a shake of a hand in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in mid May, Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa completed his political transformation.

Gone was the man who once had an American [bounty](https://x.com/DigitalOutreach/status/862320076241993730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E862320076241993730%7Ctwgr%5E7104739bc23ce28a874a34d36e623f1bbb993594%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmonitor.com%2F20170511-dead-or-alive-us-offers-10-million-for-syria-rebel-commander%2F)
 of US$10 million on his head. As the pace of the Israeli attacks continued unabated after the ouster of Assad, several diplomatic pathways emerged, the most public of which have been the [talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-israel-have-begun-talks-avoid-clashes-syria-turkish-sources-say-2025-04-10/)
 between Turkey and Israel in the Azerbaijani capital Baku aimed at creating a ‚Äútechnical mechanism‚Äù to reduce ‚Äúunwanted incidents‚Äù in Syria.

According to a former Syrian diplomat, the Israeli attacks in the south of Syria are in part driven by a concern about Turkey‚Äôs potential influence near Israeli-held territory.

‚ÄúAfter Iran‚Äôs withdrawal from Syria, Turkey is looking to fill the vacuum by striking understandings with the new leadership in Damascus,‚Äù the diplomat says. The pitch included promises for a [Trump Tower](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tower-damascus-syria-seeks-charm-us-president-sanctions-relief-2025-05-11/)

 developing the country‚Äôs energy resources with Western firms and a new US-listed Syrian national oil company.

In the weeks leading up to the US summit, it was clear what the US and Israel wanted: normalization between the Syrian regime and Israel.¬†

For countries with sway in Damascus, the question was who would take the lead.¬†

It was Saudi Arabia, a Syrian political source, close to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, says that those in Damascus were calling ‚ÄúWashington‚Äôs reconciliation Godfather.‚Äù Keen to [cement](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-saudi-arabia-have-discussed-riyadhs-potential-purchase-f-35-jets-2025-05-13/)
 a lucrative defense agreement with the kingdom, long thought to be the carrot to induce Saudi-Israeli normalization, the US was willing to accommodate what the regional diplomat says was a desire to be seen ‚Äúas the card holder of the Syrian situation in the region.‚Äù

And that accommodation went so far as securing a promise from Trump to lift all sanctions on the Syrian regime, the regional diplomat adds ‚Äî a promise that bucked a widespread belief in the American capital of a [‚Äúcautious, incrementalist approach.‚Äù](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/president-trumps-gulf-trip-whirlwind-three-days-region)

For Sharaa‚Äôs government, weak as it is, a turn to Riyadh allowed them to hide behind the much more powerful actor in Saudi Arabia, who has thus far refused to accept a move forward with normalization with Israel.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no secret that the US intends to encourage Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords convoy alongside the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco. Gone was the moniker that had marked his existential opposition to Israel, his diluted jihadi branding, itself the rebrand of a rebrand.

Sharaa was now a man who could stand in front of the US president, shake his hand and discuss the ‚ÄúNew Syria‚Äù after decades of civil war, sanctions and authoritarian rule had fractured and immiserated the country.

And like him, Syria seems to be on the pathway to being born anew. And now, Syria has [relief](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-sign-order-related-syria-sanctions-easing-cbs-news-reports-2025-06-30/)
 from the sanctions that decimated its economy for so long.

But the line dividing the old and the new is not so easily made.

After Sharaa met US President Donald Trump during the American leader‚Äôs glitzy, made-for-TV tour of the Gulf, he took to national television to celebrate Trump‚Äôs verbal promise to lift sanctions but also to underscore the hurdles facing the transition.

‚ÄúThe window of hope overlooks and supervises a promising future. A host of other investors are practically [salivating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/too-good-be-true-investors-eye-syria-after-trump-sanctions-move-2025-05-14/)
 to bring money back into the country.

Sharaa enjoyed a lavish Gulf tour, ‚Äúliving his best life,‚Äù as some commentators [noted](https://x.com/ragipsoylu/status/1929128687913390571?s=46&t=jkJlaUvTKeCtY4AcNtnlqQ)
.

In the high of the moment, and after repeated encounters with the Americans and mixed signals from the Israelis, Sharaa misread the messages and thought he was greenlit to take control of all of Suwayda, the city tucked away in the country‚Äôs south with a population predominantly made up of Druze, according to multiple sources.

And thus in just a few weeks‚Äô time, Sharaa‚Äôs high of highs came crashing back to the earth.

On July 11, [clashes](https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%84-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7/769601/)

[Careful footwork: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a joint press conference for Israeli President Isaac Herzog's state visit to Ankara, Turkey, on March 9, 2022. This could intensify competition across overlapping spheres of influence ‚Äì from Syria and Iraq to the Eastern Mediterranean and the South Caucasus.

The characterisation of Turkey as the principal beneficiary of the recent Iran-Israel conflict ‚Äì emerging unscathed while its two regional rivals engaged in direct confrontation ‚Äì oversimplifies the pressures facing Ankara‚Äôs foreign and security policy. Once close allies now appear to be on a collision course ‚Äì but it is crucial to discern what is real, what is calibrated for domestic audiences, and how much of the current tension may ultimately prove impermanent.

The Current State of Bilateral Relations
----------------------------------------

Despite efforts to rehabilitate ties between Turkey and Israel following President Isaac Herzog‚Äôs [historic state visit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/middleeast/israel-isaac-herzog-turkey-visit.html)
 to Ankara in March 2022, relations nosedived as Israel‚Äôs military action in Gaza intensified following the horrific Hamas attacks on 7th October 2023, triggering a rising civilian death toll rose and a humanitarian catastrophe there.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the [harshest critics](https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-compare-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-adolf-hitler-unga/)
 of the current Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Domestically, Israeli military unilateralism is already emboldening Turkey‚Äôs own assertive defence posture, fuelling efforts to strengthen its indigenous military capabilities.

While Israel and Turkey diverge sharply in their visions for the region‚Äôs future security architecture, they share some objectives: limit the possibility of Iranian re-entrenchment in the region, particularly across Syria; and the refusal to tolerate hostile actors on their borders.

The Regional Alliance-Building Race
-----------------------------------

For Israel and Iran, the current pause seems to be an opportunity to reframe their post-war narratives and shore up regional allies as a form of strategic deterrence. Such complexity is testament to blurred lines, overlapping trade interests, and transactional diplomacy, a not so hidden receding of previous ‚Äòus or them‚Äô binaries.

The Kurdish Question in Turkey-Israel Ties
------------------------------------------

If tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate to military standoff, it will most likely spark in Syria. [Israel sees](https://www.inss.org.il/social_media/between-the-united-states-turkey-and-israel-insights-from-the-announcement-on-reducing-us-forces-in-syria/)
 diminished American troop presence in Syria as a win for Turkey, and a setback for Israel.

Israel‚Äôs support for the Kurds, a group seen as less hostile to Israel, has amplified since the overthrow of the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Rather than direct confrontation, a more imminent risk relates to a sub-threshold conflict or ‚Äògrey zone‚Äô activity between Turkey and Israel.

While the prospect of formal normalisation between Israel and either Lebanon or Syria remains highly improbable, the establishment of a functional non-aggression mechanism ‚Äì particularly from the perspective of Damascus ‚Äì could be transformative. This will inevitably call for a recalibration of the strategic triangle between Turkey, Israel, and Iran.

[Close](#) In this chaotic vacuum, Turkey and Israel have re-engaged, translating Syria‚Äôs power void into a contest of occupied sovereign space, masked by counterterrorism and humanitarian rhetoric.

**Competing foreign agendas**

In the shifting strategic landscape of post-Assad Syria, both countries have consolidated their positions in what many now refer to as Syria‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond civil war‚Äù‚Äîa reconfiguration of violence in which domestic forces have become subordinate to competitive regional designs. Despite diverging styles and strategic end goals, Turkey and Israel have emerged as the leading external powers, influencing both territorial reconfigurations and institutional developments in Syria‚Äôs new order.

Ankara‚Äôs engagement is both pervasive and systematic. Turkish policy appears driven by three primary goals: to inhibit, through direct intervention, any consolidation of a Kurdish self-governing enclave along the southern border; to orchestrate the organized, albeit selective, return of Syrian refugees under a Turkish oversight apparatus; and, ultimately, to lay the foundations of a post-Assad settlement conforming to Ankara‚Äôs strategic calculus and its pan-Islamist conception of regional order.

    [Pipelines, peace and power: The 2025 Armenia-Azerbaijan agreement in geopolitical perspective](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/22/pipelines-peace-and-power-the-2025-armenia-azerbaijan-agreement-in-geopolitical-perspective/)

Within these zones, Ankara has inserted substitutive governance networks, dispersing gendarmeries, judge panels and municipal advisory bodies that are underpinned by Turkish parliamentary appropriations. Accordingly, the reconfiguration of Syria‚Äôs political order will hinge as much upon these domestic actors as upon any external endeavor to impose change.

**Legacy actors recalibrate**¬†

Even as Turkey and Israel now dominate the foreign policy landscape in Syria, the influence of Russia and Iran‚Äîonce the key players of the Assad regime‚Äîhas not entirely disappeared from the equation. Turkey and Israel, for instance, impose authority over selected territories without openly claiming them; the resulting spheres of governance more closely resemble imperial protectorates than classical foreign military occupations, thereby reconstituting the region‚Äôs constitutional and geopolitical boundaries without invoking outright annexation.

**Conclusion: Controlled disintegration as doctrine**

If the Syrian model is reproduced, the region may enter an era in which weaker states function as laboratories for informal empire and diplomacy is replaced by strategic classification. The competing designs of Turkey and Israel point to a wider pattern, where formal sovereignty gives way to security imperatives and strategic influence is secured by proxies.¬†

What is clear, however, is that the Syrian crisis has entered a new chapter‚Äîdefined not by revolution or counterrevolution, but by the slow, deliberate architecture of fragmentation.

Troops of the 810th "Mountains" Regional Brigade operate in southern Syria, in a handout photo issued on May 5, 2025. (Israel Defense Forces)

Israel and Turkey have reached an agreement in principle aimed at preventing any unwanted incidents between both countries‚Äô militaries operating in Syria, and established a hotline to avert such conflicts, according to media reports on Wednesday.

An Israeli official told the Israel Hayom daily that the deal was reached Wednesday, after over a [month of talks mediated by Azerbaijan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)
, a mutual ally of the two countries, which were confirmed by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office last month.

A hotline will be used to avert clashes between Israel, which has troops in the south of the country, and Turkey, whose military is operating in the north of the country, two sources familiar with the issue told the [Middle East Eye](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-israel-establish-hotline-syria)
 news site.

Russia and Israel also [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 in 2015 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country, and Russia provided military support for the Bashar al-Assad regime amid the Syrian civil war.

A source familiar with the talks told the site that Jerusalem was generally at ease with Ankara‚Äôs deployment of its forces in Syria, with the main issue over where Turkey would deploy its air defenses and radars, which could scan for Israeli aerial activities. The negotiations are now ‚Äúfocusing on the so-called Palmyra line‚Äù ‚Äî an area where Turkey sought to take over airbases.

Reuters reported last month that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria near Palmyra where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

‚ÄúThose bases represent a gray zone; the Israelis could be amenable to Turkish deployments north of that area,‚Äù the source said.

Turkish military officials said they had nothing to announce on the matter.

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of Assad.

Following the fall of Assad, Israel has also carried out a campaign to destroy Syrian military capabilities so that they cannot threaten Israel. It fears that if Turkey establishes a military presence in Syria, it could hamper the Israeli Air Force‚Äôs freedom of action in the region.

Israel also moved troops into the Syrian side of the two countries‚Äô demilitarized buffer zone, citing fear that it would fall into the wrong hands.

Meanwhile, Israel has been [holding secret talks](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-israel-holding-talks-with-syria-on-sharaa-regime-joining-abraham-accords/)
 with Syrian officials, including on the possibility of the new regime joining the Abraham Accords, according to a report released last week, a day after US President Donald Trump invited new Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to join the accords and normalize ties with Israel.

Turkey is a key backer of the Islamist-led coalition that toppled Assad late last year after almost 14 years of civil war. Sign in to stop seeing this](//crm.timesofisrael.com/sign-in)

[![Troops of the 810th "Mountains" Regional Brigade operate in southern Syria, in a handout photo issued on May 5, 2025. Israel is wary of the Islamist presence on its border and has lobbied the United States to curb Turkey‚Äôs growing influence in the country.

Turkey‚Äôs President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is an avowed supporter of Hamas and one of the leading critics of Israel on the world stage, and his country has frequently praised the Iran-backed Palestinian terror group‚Äôs October 7, 2023, attack that started the ongoing war, when thousands of terrorists invaded southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) ‚Äî Syria‚Äôs interim government has requested Turkey‚Äôs support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat ‚Äúterrorist organizations,‚Äù including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria‚Äôs defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

‚ÄúAs long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,‚Äù Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan‚Äôs ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

‚ÄúThe heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey‚Äôs national security,‚Äù he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a ‚Äúprotectorate‚Äù in Syria.

We're not going anywhere.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria‚Äôs interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey‚Äôs national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has ‚Äúno position‚Äù on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,‚Äù he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria‚Äôs national army."

Another article from Madamasr.com ([https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) discusses a meeting between Turkish and Syrian officials in May 2025 and talks between Turkey and Israel in April 2025.

A RUSI article ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)) discusses the relationship between Turkey and Israel, mentioning a state visit in March 2022 and Israeli airstrikes in March. It also mentions Turkey's export and import restrictions against Israel in May 2024 (<image:k>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia page about the Israeli invasion of Syria (2024‚Äìpresent), which mentions a timeline of events including clashes and foreign involvement, including Israeli and Turkish involvement in 2025 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was involved in Syrian affairs in 2025, including military intervention and diplomatic talks. The evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria and meetings between Turkish and US officials in May 2025. There is also mention of Turkish military intervention in northern Syria in March 2025. Furthermore, an agreement between Israel and Turkey to prevent clashes in Syria was reached, with a photo of troops operating in southern Syria on May 5, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

Israel‚Äôs air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) ‚Äî Israel‚Äôs multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran‚Äôs latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday‚Äôs night‚Äôs strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

**WATCH:**¬†[Middle East again on edge after largest aerial attack ever launched against Israel](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/middle-east-again-on-edge-after-largest-aerial-attack-ever-launched-against-israel)

In Tuesday‚Äôs attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel‚Äôs air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn‚Äôt 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here‚Äôs a closer look at Israel‚Äôs multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

Iranian missile strikes show Israel‚Äôs aerial defense array is not ironclad

Iranian missile strikes show Israel‚Äôs aerial defense array is not ironclad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 of 3¬†|¬†

Air raid sirens sounded across Israel on Friday night as Iranian missiles were launched towards the country. assistance, has developed a tiered system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure while letting other projectiles land in open spaces.

The array can shoot down short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to ballistic missiles like those Iran has been firing.

But the military warns the system is not fool proof and while interception rates are generally high, enemy missiles can penetrate. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems.

According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The PBS News Hour reported that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% in intercepting missiles during the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. This aligns with the claim. However, an Associated Press article from June 19, 2025, states that the Iron Dome is not foolproof, which implies that the interception rate can vary.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true, as the PBS News Hour specifically mentions the 90% success rate.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

!An Israeli tank moves a long the border with the Gaza Strip on January 1, 2025 in Southern Israel, Israel. (Photo by Amir Levy/Getty Images) <image:2076>

An Israeli tank moves a long the border with the Gaza Strip on January 1, 2025 in Southern Israel, Israel. One user wrote, ‚ÄúThe Merkava tank is the most famous Israeli military industry. In Gaza, they made it into a Gazan fruit and vegetable stall. It also identifies the location as Homs, not Damascus.

‚ÄúThe army left a tank‚Ä¶ for almost three days, I brought the goods, but no one saw the shop,‚Äù Youssef says in the video.

Furthermore, the tank is a [T-54/55](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/WEG/Asset/T-54_Russian_Main_Battle_Tank_(MBT)
), not a Merkava tank. A Merkava tank has a [flatter turret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava)
 than the Soviet-era tank, which was [widely used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Syrian_Army)
 by the Syrian Arab Army.

 Israel lost dozens of tanks during the conflict, including several Merkavas.[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)

### Second Intifada

In February 2002, a Merkava III was destroyed by a roadside bomb near [Netzarim](/wiki/Netzarim "Netzarim")
 in the Gaza Strip. The IDF wanted to increase orders of new Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and planned to add the [Trophy active defense system](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 to Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and to increase joint training between crews and Israeli [anti-tank](/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare "Anti-tank warfare")
 soldiers.[\[58\]](#cite_note-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)

### Operation Cast Lead

Main article: [Operation Cast Lead](/wiki/Operation_Cast_Lead "Operation Cast Lead")

The Merkava Mark IV was used more extensively during the [Gaza War](/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%932009) "Gaza War (2008‚Äì2009)")
, as it had been received by the IDF in increasing numbers since 2006, replacing more of the Merkava II and III versions of the tank that were in service. The Trophy protective system has been used by the IDF since 2011.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg/250px-Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg)](/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg)

Merkava IV equipped with the [Trophy](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 active defense system.

By October 2010, the IDF had begun to equip the first Merkava Mark IVs with the Trophy active protection system, to improve the tanks' protection against advanced anti-tank missiles which use [tandem-charge](/wiki/Tandem-charge "Tandem-charge")
 HEAT warheads.[\[62\]](#cite_note-62)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-weiss-63)
 Added protection systems included an Elbit laser-warning system and IMI in-built smoke-screen grenades.[\[29\]](#cite_note-Merkava_Mk_IV_breaks_cover-29)

In December 2010, [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 fired an [AT-14 Kornet](/wiki/AT-14_Kornet "AT-14 Kornet")
 anti-tank missile at a Merkava Mark 3 tank stationed on the Israel-Gaza border near Al-[Bureij](/wiki/Bureij "Bureij")
. As a result of the attack, Israel decided to deploy its first Merkava Mark 4 battalion equipped with the Trophy system along the Gaza border.[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)

On March 1, 2011, a Merkava Mark IV stationed near the Gaza border, equipped with the Trophy active protection system, successfully foiled a missile attack against it, marking the system's first operational success.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

### Operation Protective Edge 2014

Main article: [Operation Protective Edge](/wiki/Operation_Protective_Edge "Operation Protective Edge")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg/250px-Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)](/wiki/File:Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)

Merkava Mk 4M Windbreaker, fitted with [Trophy](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 [active protection system](/wiki/Active_protection_system "Active protection system")
, during [Operation Protective Edge](/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict "2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict")

No tanks were damaged during Operation Protective Edge. _(May 2024)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal "Help:Maintenance template removal")<br>)_ |

Some Merkava tanks are fitted with full medical and ambulance abilities while retaining their armament (but carrying less ammunition than the standard tank, having both ammunition racks in the rear removed). The Loader Keyboard Panel (LKP) includes breech block closing switch, fire and local activation of the trays.

The main operational roles are: firing from internal storage; firing for elevator ‚Äì ground-piled ammunition; loading from elevator ‚Äì external pile; synthesising fire programs; unloading; manual firing; identification; and fusing and checks.

Standard equipment includes an NBC system of the overpressure type and an inertial navigation and aiming system designed for autonomous operations.

According to Soltam Systems, the 155¬†mm/52 caliber ordnance and automatic loader, or parts of the system, could be installed in other self-propelled artillery systems and used to upgrade other self-propelled systems such as the US-designed and built 155¬†mm [M109](/wiki/M109_howitzer "M109 howitzer")
 and [M44](/wiki/M44_self_propelled_howitzer "M44 self propelled howitzer")
.

Successor (Carmel)
------------------

On July 14, 2011, _[The Jerusalem Post](/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post "The Jerusalem Post")
_ reported that the IDF had begun developing a successor for the Merkava series of tanks. With the system's ability to intercept threats at a stand-off distance, there was a review of the need for vehicles like the Merkava to have thick, heavy layers of armor.[\[82\]](#cite_note-82)

The Merkava Tank Planning Directorate set up a team to study principles for a future tank and present ideas for an armored fighting vehicle to provide mobile firepower on a future battlefield. [Jump to content](#bodyContent)

Hamas's anti-tank flyer.

Via social media

Hamas terrorists think they know how to knock out the Israeli army‚Äôs main tank, the 70-ton Merkava Mark IV.

Aim for the rear hatch and ammunition-stowage, the space between the turret and hull, the tank‚Äôs belly or a supposed weak spot in the armor on the side of the hull near the front. The ammo storage, turret ring and belly are weak spots on virtually _all_ tanks.

What‚Äôs more surprising is Hamas‚Äô tips for defeating the Trophy active protective systems that are new features on some of the Israeli army‚Äôs roughly 400 front-line Merkava Mark IVs. Alternatively, an SPG-9 recoilless gun should defeat a Trophy-equipped tank, simply by virtue of its projectile‚Äôs high speed.

There is some evidence of Hamas militants damaging a Merkava with an PG-7T rocket on Oct. It‚Äôs possible the terrorists dutifully followed the flyer‚Äôs advice; it‚Äôs _also_ possible they defeated the tank‚Äôs Trophy by firing several rounds in quick succession‚Äîand overwhelming the device.

In any event, it wasn‚Äôt RPG teams who claimed the most Merkavas on Oct. Hamas‚Äô small drones [struck at least two](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/?sh=172138352114 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/?sh=172138352114")
 of the heavily-armed, thickly-armored tanks. Another hit a Merkava on the turret bustle, which holds spare 120-millimeter cannon rounds for the four-person crew.

And the militants also _captured_ a Merkava‚Äî[along with more than a dozen superheavy armored personnel carriers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israel-converted-captured-arab-t-55-tanks-into-heavy-personnel-carriers-hamas-just-captured-a-tenth-of-them/?sh=60c212994a84 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israel-converted-captured-arab-t-55-tanks-into-heavy-personnel-carriers-hamas-just-captured-a-tenth-of-them/?sh=60c212994a84")
‚Äîat an Israeli army base in Nakhal Oz. The terrorists abducted hundreds more people in settlements near the Israeli wall surrounding Gaza.

The Israelis retrieved at least one of the flyers, apparently from a dead Hamas fighter, and posted photos on social media.

The flyer‚Äôs contents should come as no surprise to experienced soldiers. One aimed its payload at the thin armor protecting the tank‚Äôs engine in its forward hull. You don‚Äôt need help from a flyer when a tank is crewless and idle.

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

### OPERATION DAWN OF FREEDOM

Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army had liberated the center of the Tel Rifaat district from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG on the first day of the Operation Dawn of Freedom, which was launched in December. With the liberation of the Manbij district during the operation, the region, which had turned into the largest terrorist stronghold west of the Euphrates River, was cleared of PKK/YPG.

### ABANDONED TANK BECAME A FRUIT STAND

On the other hand, an abandoned tank by regime forces became a fruit stand. The image showed various fruits and vegetables being sold on the tank's surface.

The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The tank was converted into a fruit and vegetable stand.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, used as a fruit stand in Syria, not Gaza. The claim misidentifies the tank and the location.

CLAIM: An image shows a social media post by actor Mel Gibson about ‚Äúthe end‚Äù of Israel and the country‚Äôs desire to ‚Äúdestroy everything‚Äù in its way.

AP‚ÄôS ASSESSMENT: False. Gibson has not posted on social media about "the end" of Israel, as some users have falsely claimed. Gibson has not posted on social media about ‚Äúthe end‚Äù of Israel, as some users have falsely claimed. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor‚Äôs publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the ‚ÄúBraveheart‚Äù star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn‚Äôt quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The ‚Äúpost‚Äù features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: ‚ÄúSoon the end and they know it, that‚Äôs why they want to destroy everything in the way.‚Äù

But Alan Nierob, Gibson‚Äôs publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor ‚Äúdid not make the post.‚Äù Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have any public social media accounts.‚Äù

An image shows a Facebook post from actor Mel Gibson that references Israel with the words, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

**Rating:**

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel&#39;s time was coming to an end and that&#39;s why they&#39;re destroying everything in the way. <image:11719>

Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel's time was coming to an end and that's why they're destroying everything in the way.

However, the truth was that Gibson had no public-facing social media accounts. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

The post apparently referenced the fact that Israel had [continued to conduct airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-b084e9c453cc99f7bec6f66d7b5913d9)
 in Gaza while at the same time preparing its military for a ground assault. Further, the first few words of the caption appeared to have been a poor translation to English by the person who created the post.

While it's true that Gibson had [expressed](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
¬†some anti-Semitic views in the past, the post in question was fake.

Mel Gibson's past controversies‚Äîincluding previous [racist, antisemitic and sexist comments](https://www.newsweek.com/mel-gibson-anti-semitism-racism-accusations-1512808)
‚Äîhave risen to the fore again amid the consequences Susan Sarandon and Melissa Barrera have faced for their pro-Palestinian posts.

As the Israel-Hamas conflict rages, a number of celebrities have garnered mixed reactions from the public no matter what stance they publicly take. Steve Granitz/FilmMagic

Meanwhile, [Barrera was dropped from _Scream 7_](https://www.newsweek.com/melissa-barrera-scream-firing-sparks-fears-over-new-hollywood-blacklist-1845901)
 after she shared a host of pro-Palestinian posts, including an article that accused Israel of committing "genocide" through its strikes on Gaza.

The article‚Äîwritten for progressive Jewish magazine _Currents_ by Raz Segal, associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University‚Äîdescribed the assault on Gaza as "a [textbook case of genocide](https://www.newsweek.com/holocaust-historian-israel-committing-genocide-raz-segal-1835346)
 unfolding in front of our eyes."

When contacted by _Newsweek_, a spokesperson for production company Spyglass Media Group highlighted a statement shared with _Variety_ that read: "Spyglass' stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech."

However, a number of social media users have pointed out that while these screen stars have faced losses for their comments, Gibson has continued to work in the years since he infamously told a police officer in 2006 that "Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

_Newsweek_ has contacted a representative of Gibson via email for comment.

"Very brave of Hollywood to go after several, seemingly dispensable, female actors for expressions of Palestinian solidarity while simultaneously rehabilitating Mel Gibson‚Äîan actual anti-Semite," said one detractor on X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter)

Newsweek AI is in beta. "Mel Gibson can still walk down a street in Hollywood without getting jumped."

Amid the criticism, a scattering of social media users spoke out in Gibson's defense, with one writing: "Mel Gibson's 'incident' happened nearly 20 years ago and cost him an awful lot."

Gibson has continued a slow walk back to Hollywood over the past decade following a number of controversies that involved racist, antisemitic and sexist comments, which have marred his career since the mid-2000s.

He made a number of headlines for offensive remarks over the past 16 years‚Äîperhaps most infamously, one made to a police officer in 2006 that "Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

While he has secured a number of roles since then, including critically acclaimed ones leading to an [Oscar nomination for his 2016 film _Hacksaw Ridge_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/awards/)
, he appeared to struggle to wipe the slate clean entirely; news in 2021 that he would direct an upcoming [_Lethal Weapon_ movie was met with lingering criticism](https://www.newsweek.com/joshua-malina-calls-hollywood-cancel-jew-hater-mel-gibson-antisemitism-1656303)
.

In 2006, Gibson apologized to a Los Angeles police officer who claimed the actor had shouted abuse at him during an arrest, including a claim that "the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

He later issued an apology asking Jewish people for forgiveness.

"There is no excuse, nor should there be any tolerance, for anyone who thinks or expresses any kind of anti-Semitic remark," Gibson said in a statement per the _New York Times_.

He continued, in part: "I want to apologize specifically to everyone in the Jewish community for the vitriolic and harmful words that I said to a law enforcement officer the night I was arrested on a D.U.I. United Talent Agency confirmed to _Newsweek_ it had cut ties with Sarandon.

"There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country," Sarandon was quoted as saying.

In apparent reference to Gibson's role in the [Peacock](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/peacock)
 miniseries _The Continental: From the World of John Wick_, another wrote: "Firing Melissa Barrera for acknowledging a genocide in a year where Mel Gibson was allowed to lead a big budget tv show is some straight up f\*\*\*\*\*\* bulls\*\*\*."

"Meanwhile we have an award winning actor/director who has actually said antisemitic, anti-Black and misogynist things and he is STILL getting the bag," a different commenter said of Gibson. "Funny how that works."

[A different person wrote](https://twitter.com/benyahr/status/1727158430438469876)
: "I love that everyone is getting fired because Hollywood 'has no room for antisemitism' and also Mel Gibson still stars in movies and tv shows."

"Susan Sarandon could have chosen her words more carefully but let's not act like her being dropped came out of genuine concern for antisemitism" another stated. I guess as who I am, I'm not allowed to have a nervous breakdown, ever."

In June 2020, Winona Ryder told _The Sunday Times_ that Gibson asked if she was an "oven dodger," in apparent reference to the Holocaust.

Ryder, who identifies as Jewish, alleged: "We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we're all talking and he said to my friend, who's gay, 'Oh wait, am I gonna get AIDS?' And then something came up about Jews, and he said, 'You're not an oven dodger, are you?'"

The _Stranger Things_ star added that Gibson "tried" to apologize at a later date.

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018‚Äîboth unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

    . "This shows how geophysical data played an important role in a geopolitical crisis."

The earthquake occurred on Oct. 5, approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Semnan, a city in northern Iran, and about 216 kilometers (134 miles) east of Tehran. Iran is prone to earthquakes, as it sits within a seismically active region at the convergence of the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates.

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. What's reality?‚Äù

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.¬†

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials ‚Äì including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äì can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza.

‚ÄúThe Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,‚Äù read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that ‚Äúwhether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister ‚Äì as it is currently declared ‚Äì of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.‚Äù

In November, the ICC issued¬†[arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas‚Äôs [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland‚Äôs President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration ‚Äúunhindered‚Äù, given the event‚Äôs exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda‚Äôs office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

‚ÄúIn the opinion of the president, there is one issue ‚Äì precisely because it is the¬†Auschwitz¬†camp, every person from¬†Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,‚Äù she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW¬†‚Äî¬†Poland‚Äôs President Andrzej Duda is asking the country‚Äôs government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world‚Äôs top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that ‚Äúit has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.‚Äù

‚ÄúPoland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,‚Äù it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is ‚Äúfake news‚Äù that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that ‚Äúall instruments‚Äù related to ensuring Netanyahu‚Äôs stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk‚Äôs government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda‚Äôs office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government¬†passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given¬†that the Israeli prime minister did not¬†actually plan¬†to attend in person ‚Äî as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link ‚Äî The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless,¬†the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the case was 'very delicate'Image: Antoni Byszewski/Fotonews/Newspix/IMAGO

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews¬†and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and¬†16.6% were undecided.

The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu (left), his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant (right) and Hamas leader Mohammed DeifImage: ABIR SULTAN/AFP

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike¬†also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous ‚Äî even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security¬†could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

There are claims the resolution sought to avert the risk of a crisis in US-Polish relations right at the start of Trump's second administrationImage: Carlos Barria/REUTERS

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
¬†administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose¬†sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies,¬†which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage ‚Äî with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also¬†met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities¬†and the opposition ‚Äî from the far left to the far right ‚Äî condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as¬†supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

By¬†[Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a ‚Äúfew‚Äù hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel‚Äôs emergency service.

Here‚Äôs what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at ‚Äúvital military and security targets‚Äù in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran‚Äôs new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted ‚Äúa large number‚Äù of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were ‚Äúisolated‚Äù impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.‚Äù

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is ‚Äúfully prepared to defend and retaliate‚Äù against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a ‚Äútimely manner‚Äù.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration ‚Äúmade clear that there will be consequences ‚Äî severe consequences ‚Äî for this attack‚Äù by Iran, and the US ‚Äúwill work with Israel to make that the case‚Äù.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in ‚Äúa full-scale regional war‚Äù that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military ‚Äúcoordinated closely‚Äù with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   ‚ÄúUS naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,‚Äù Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: ‚ÄúIn short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,‚Äù he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday‚Äôs attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel‚Äôs war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had ‚Äúmade a big mistake‚Äù and ‚Äúwill pay for it‚Äù.
*   Israel‚Äôs envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country ‚Äúwill take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel‚Äù: ‚ÄúAs we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,‚Äù Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a ‚Äúdecisive response‚Äù to Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúaggressions‚Äù. ‚ÄúDo not enter into a conflict with Iran.‚Äù
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said ‚ÄúIran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.‚Äù
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as ‚Äúheroic‚Äù and said it sent ‚Äúa strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism‚Äù.
*   The US pledged its ‚Äúironclad‚Äù support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was ‚Äúfully, fully, fully supportive of Israel‚Äù. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would ‚Äústand by the people of Israel at this critical moment‚Äù.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed ‚Äúthe severe consequences for Iran‚Äù should it launch a ‚Äúdirect military attack‚Äù on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,‚Äù he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel ‚Äúhas been trying to invite this war‚Äù through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it‚Äôs on the path to some type of war with Israel.‚Äù

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, the provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The articles about Poland protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest are from January 2025, which is several months after the missile attack. These articles discuss the context of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his whereabouts during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain information about Netanyahu's location on October 1, 2024.

The Al Jazeera article states that the attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations and also includes Netanyahu's reaction. <image:i>, <image:281>, <image:282>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, the provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The articles about Poland protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest are from January 2025, which is several months after the missile attack. These articles discuss the context of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his whereabouts during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain information about Netanyahu's location on October 1, 2024.

How Netanyahu weathered the storm in the year since Hamas attacked
==================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

Despite deep unpopularity outside his rightwing base, Israel‚Äôs leader continues to use war and political divisions to his advantage

*   [Middle East crisis ‚Äì live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/30/israel-attacks-live-blog-lebanon-yemen-hamas-hezbollah-news-updates-middle-east-crisis)
    

At the beginning of September, the discovery that six Israeli hostages had been killed by their Hamas captors as troops operated near the tunnel where they were being held propelled huge crowds into the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities.

The focus of the dismay and anger: the government of [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
. A poll for Channel 12 on Sunday ‚Äì two days after the [assassination of the Hezbollah leader](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/hassan-nasrallah-obituary)
 ‚Äì showed another slight improvement in his standing, although at the expense of other parties in his coalition.

The reality is that even before Nasrallah‚Äôs death, Netanyahu‚Äôs weathering of all storms was surprising, as Israel‚Äôs year-long war in Gaza drags on, and fighting on fronts from Lebanon to Yemen has sharply escalated in the past week.

On the world stage Netanyahu ‚Äì and Israel by association ‚Äì has appeared scorned and isolated. The Israeli prime minister was forced to bring his own chorus of noisy admirers to cheer him from the gallery at the UN general assembly last week, shortly before the Nasrallah killing, [as many diplomats walked out](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/sep/27/delegates-walk-out-of-un-general-assembly-chamber-as-benjamin-netanyahu-takes-podium-video)
.

Inside Israel, a majority still believe he should resign, not least for the security failings that [led to 7 October](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/04/hamas-leaders-charged-us-7-october-attack-israel-yahya-sinwar-ismail-haniyeh-gaza)

 border area with Egypt.

But despite being deeply unpopular outside his own rightwing base, polling at the end of the month for news outlet Maariv revealed that the Likud party of Netanyahu, which many believed could not personally survive the fallout of Hamas‚Äôs surprise attack almost a year ago, would win the largest number of seats if elections were called now.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several news articles from January 2025 discuss Poland's plans to protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest. These articles, including those from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)), the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)), and DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)), report on the context of an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Netanyahu. <image:k> <image:k> <image:k>

The articles focus on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and whether Netanyahu would attend. The DW.COM article also mentions an opinion poll regarding the situation.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, which is discussed in articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)), and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The Wikipedia article refers to the attack as "Operation True Promise II" and mentions that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" and vowed that Iran "will pay" for it.

The NPR article notes that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentions an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. The Al Jazeera article states that the attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations and also includes Netanyahu's reaction. <image:i>, <image:281>, <image:282>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, the provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The articles about Poland protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest are from January 2025, which is several months after the missile attack. These articles discuss the context of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his whereabouts during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain information about Netanyahu's location on October 1, 2024.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli‚ÄìLebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli‚ÄìLebanese conflict")

Attack
------

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran‚Äôs true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several news articles from January 2025 discuss Poland's plans to protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest. These articles, including those from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)), the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)), and DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)), report on the context of an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Netanyahu. <image:k> <image:k> <image:k>

The articles focus on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and whether Netanyahu would attend. The DW.COM article also mentions an opinion poll regarding the situation.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, which is discussed in articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)), and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The Wikipedia article refers to the attack as "Operation True Promise II" and mentions that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" and vowed that Iran "will pay" for it.

The NPR article notes that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentions an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. The Al Jazeera article states that the attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations and also includes Netanyahu's reaction. <image:i>, <image:281>, <image:282>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, the provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The articles about Poland protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest are from January 2025, which is several months after the missile attack. These articles discuss the context of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his whereabouts during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain information about Netanyahu's location on October 1, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several news articles from January 2025 discuss Poland's plans to protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest. These articles, including those from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)), the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)), and DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)), report on the context of an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Netanyahu. <image:k> <image:k> <image:k>

The articles focus on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and whether Netanyahu would attend. The DW.COM article also mentions an opinion poll regarding the situation.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, which is discussed in articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)), and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The Wikipedia article refers to the attack as "Operation True Promise II" and mentions that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" and vowed that Iran "will pay" for it.

The NPR article notes that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentions an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. The Al Jazeera article states that the attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations and also includes Netanyahu's reaction. <image:i>, <image:281>, <image:282>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, the provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The articles about Poland protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest are from January 2025, which is several months after the missile attack. These articles discuss the context of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his whereabouts during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain information about Netanyahu's location on October 1, 2024.

Some on X are calling it the ‚ÄòIsraeli Motorola massacre,‚Äô blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war¬†in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries,¬†fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569¬†people killed, including 50¬†children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
¬†investigated¬†some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads¬†[the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link ‚Äî the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including¬†¬†[X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link ‚Äî X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link ‚Äî Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link ‚Äî Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have¬†[reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link ‚Äî reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and¬†indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an¬†odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with¬†the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real¬†attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform¬†later corroborated by human experts.

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link ‚Äî post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_,"¬†accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds¬†show¬†glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including¬†[English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link ‚Äî English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link ‚Äî Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link ‚Äî Urdu")
¬†and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link ‚Äî Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip¬†reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link ‚Äî celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club ‚Äî not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link ‚Äî more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P,"¬†consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link ‚Äî Algerian law enforcement.")
¬†And these celebrations took place¬†at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips.¬†They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link ‚Äî previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link ‚Äî show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area.¬†

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities.¬†

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip.¬†

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_,"¬†claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link ‚Äî post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine"¬†because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country.¬†Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link ‚Äî Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link ‚Äî has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel.¬†

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kj√∏nnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kj√∏rte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier v√¶rt fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midt√∏sten.

De dagene krigen er p√• sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder v√¶re overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har ogs√• vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har f√•tt et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til √• v√¶re interessert i √• etablere en presis forst√•else av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter p√• nettet.

Og det er n√• nesten umulig √• fastsl√• hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun f√•r informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige sp√∏rsm√•lene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Unders√∏k hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil st√• ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for √• skape en f√∏lelsesmessig respons og for √• spille p√• folks fordommer.

Er det tegn p√• AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsl√∏res ved √• zoome inn p√• detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og t√¶r, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig p√• et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om v√¶ret, √•rstid og tid p√• d√∏gnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den f√∏rst?

Bruk et bildes√∏keprogram som Google Lens for √• finne ut om andre ogs√• deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler p√• noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler p√• X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes persons√∏kere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid f√∏r sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte persons√∏kerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med ‚Äì if√∏lge avsenderne ‚Äì at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kj√∏nnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: If√∏lge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha p√• X, er dette skader for√•rsaket under persons√∏kerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: If√∏lge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha p√• X, er dette skader for√•rsaket under persons√∏kerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket p√• arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen¬†[Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
¬†med teksten ¬´konsekvenser¬ª.

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen¬†[Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

‚Äì Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah p√•f√∏rte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er ogs√• et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 s√•rede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene p√• bildene har faktisk noe med persons√∏kerangrepet √• gj√∏re.

Og hvis du s√∏ker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildes√∏k, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 √•r gamle ikke-bin√¶re amerikanske arkitekten¬†[Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet p√• X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midt√∏sten √• gj√∏re.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil¬†p√•¬†[X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og m√•tte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for √• finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildes√∏k gir bare et litt st√∏rre utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler b√•de bein og h√∏yre √∏ye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten p√• det st√∏rre bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et s√∏k p√• navnet hans f√∏rer til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan¬†[se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
¬†av samme mann som mangler h√∏yre √∏ye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremg√•r av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for √• samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler ogs√• dette bildet som dokumentasjon p√• skader etter persons√∏kerangrepet.

Og s√• kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for persons√∏kerangrepet.

Bildene av de p√•st√•tte skadene er et godt eksempel p√• at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til √• fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har v√¶rt borti p√• sosiale medier det siste √•ret er av den typen.

Men ogs√• kunstig intelligens begynner √• bli involvert.

Den √∏delagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utf√∏rte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utf√∏rte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterp√• gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som ¬´dokumentasjon¬ª p√• at rakettene hadde for√•rsaket store skader p√• milit√¶rbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene p√• X¬†[SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
¬†og¬†[Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

‚Äì Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medf√∏lgende teksten til innlegget.

If√∏lge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og if√∏lge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader p√• basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel n√¶r haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm d√∏r, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn p√• at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn p√• at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til √• v√¶re satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det v√¶re vanskelig √• se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten √• ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilh√∏rer de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midt√∏sten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske l√∏sninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: If√∏lge flere pro-iranske kilder p√• sosiale medier s√• oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut.

SPILL: If√∏lge flere pro-iranske kilder p√• sosiale medier s√• oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske v√•pnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe m√•lene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakul√¶re bilder av missiler p√• himmelen over Israel ‚Äì men hvordan s√• det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er sp√∏rsm√•let den propalestinske X-profilen¬†[Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
¬†pr√∏vde √• svare p√• til f√∏lgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilh√∏rende teksten lyder:

‚Äì Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

P√• bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut s√• mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn p√• de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kj√∏ret√∏y, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For n√•r man ser n√¶rmere p√• bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet¬†[Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En mosk√© i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer p√• sosiale medier, deles ikke n√∏dvendigvis for √• lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved f√∏rste √∏yekast.

13\. august¬†[delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
¬†for eksempel den h√∏yreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

‚Äì Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilh√∏rende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et¬†[webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
¬†som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, s√• det er ganske enkelt √• forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok ogs√• annet enn √• spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig √• provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger p√• gruppens egen profil p√• X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den j√∏diske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger p√• propalestinske profiler som¬†[Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
,¬†[DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
¬†samt den antisionistiske kanalen¬†[Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis form√•let med videoen var √• provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen¬†[Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
¬†fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om ¬´alvorlige konsekvenser¬ª p√• grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De ¬´digitale¬ª skyene
--------------------

Ett √•r inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten s√• alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon n√• m√∏tes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

S√• langt har ikke Israels milit√¶re publisert noen bilder av m√•l som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de ber√∏rte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene p√• internett, som f√∏lger krigen tett, lenge p√• at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
¬†publiserte 2. oktober¬†et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var m√•let for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig √• se basen p√• grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktomr√•der til sine 149.000 f√∏lgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende p√•standen blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger p√• Aydens profil alene.

P√•standen ble ogs√• umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske¬†[profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
¬†som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 f√∏lgere p√• X.

‚Äì Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner p√• at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik s√• det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik s√• det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

P√• bildet med de ¬´digitale skyene¬ª kan man se en br√• overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

P√•standen om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for √• dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen f√• dager, og det er n√• offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: "<image:4532>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:4533>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name ‚Äì Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:4532>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:4535>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Israelis demonstrate around 27 coffins symbolizing hostages killed in Gaza, as they protest for the release of Israelis held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza, outside the Defense Ministry Headquarters in Tel Aviv, September 5, 2024. <image:4537>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/F240905AVS48.jpg)

Israelis carry coffins symbolizing hostages murdered by the Hamas terror group in Gaza, as they protest in Tel Aviv for the release of remaining captives, September 5, 2024. (Oren Ziv/AFPTV/AFP)

Thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv on Thursday, carrying 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in Hamas captivity in Gaza, demanding a deal to secure the remaining hostages‚Äô release. They had been murdered days before Israeli troops reached them, almost 11 months after they‚Äôd been kidnapped from Israel during Hamas‚Äôs October 7 attack.

News of the hostages‚Äô execution sparked outrage in Israel, and drew charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been refusing to pursue negotiations with Hamas in earnest, avoiding [concessions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/asked-to-decide-between-hostages-or-philadelphi-netanyahu-said-to-prefer-latter/)
 that might have allowed the Israelis to come home alive but would have endangered his ruling coalition.

As protesters in Tel Aviv gathered at Habima Square ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the [six slain hostages](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hersh-carmel-alex-eden-or-almog-the-6-hostages-murdered-by-hamas-just-days-ago/)
, accused Netanyahu of ‚Äúsentencing my cousin to death.‚Äù

Some members of the crowd shouted: ‚ÄúMurderer!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,‚Äù Dickmann said, noting the number of days Gat was held captive. (Adar Ayal)

The hostage families and supporters, carrying the caskets, held a mock funeral procession along Begin Street, in the direction of the Begin-Kaplan intersection, in front of the IDF headquarters.

The Tel Aviv thoroughfare has been a locus of demonstrations for a hostage deal and has been blocked by protesters every night since the slain hostages‚Äô bodies were recovered last weekend.

When the 27 coffins arrived at the intersection, the protest began in earnest, swelling to some 2,000 people, who chanted slogans against the government and in favor of a deal.

‚ÄúWe are all hostages of the government of blood!‚Äù protesters yelled. <image:4538>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/WhatsApp-Image-2024-09-05-at-21.29.13.jpeg)

Protesters marching in the central Israeli city of Rehovot call for the release of hostages held captive by the Hamas terror group in Gaza. <image:4539>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/F240905AVS15.jpg)

Israelis protest in Tel Aviv with photos of murdered hostages, at a demonstration calling for a deal to secure the release of remaining captives held by the Hamas terror group in Gaza, September 5, 2024. Significant crowds also gathered in Rehovot, Eilat and Jerusalem.

It was the fifth straight night of demonstrations, following the [recovery last Saturday](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-recovers-bodies-of-6-hostages-from-gaza-including-one-previously-presumed-alive/)
 of the bodies of six Israeli hostages. On the other side, cardboard planks spelled out: ‚ÄúHere lie our hostages.‚Äù

Inside the crowd, a man in Hasidic garb drew attention and applause as he delivered a philippic against Netanyahu.

‚ÄúRedeeming the hostages is the entire Torah!‚Äù he shouted into a megaphone.

Police arrested six people at the demonstration, according to an organization that represents detained protesters. There was no immediate comment from police.

As the protest wound down, police on horseback rebuffed some 100 protesters who attempted to march outside the demonstration area on Begin Street.

Central Tel Aviv police chief Micah Gafni was seen pushing one protester out of the crowd and snatching his megaphone.

A column of officers later marched into the crowd and confiscated a protester‚Äôs drum, eliciting sarcastic applause.

Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, protesters gathered near the homes of Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Knesset Member Aryeh Deri, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, as well as in the city‚Äôs central Zion Square.

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza.¬†

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

[](#) There were 327 opportunities to bring her back."

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza‚Äôs border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,‚Äù Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the¬†narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn‚Äôt distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

On 7 October 2023, [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 mounted [an attack](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
 on Israel, abducting an estimated 251 people from the country, as well as killing 1,180 more. Since then, protests have been held in the country demanding the return of the hostages from Gaza.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:4-2)
 The first protest was held on 14 October 2023, in Tel Aviv criticizing the handling of the war by the Israeli government.[\[5\]](#cite_note-bizin-5)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)
 Continued perceived inaction by the Israeli government on the issue caused additional rallies, and international rallies were held to mark the six-month anniversary and call for the return of hostages.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

On 1 September 2024, the [Israel Defense Forces](/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces")
 stated that six hostages taken by Hamas, including [Hersh Goldberg-Polin](/wiki/Hersh_Goldberg-Polin "Hersh Goldberg-Polin")
, had been found dead in a tunnel underneath [Rafah](/wiki/Rafah "Rafah")
. Several protesters were arrested following clashes that broke out after the coffins were taken by police.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:2-3)

# Your Analysis

The claim is partially accurate. The image depicts mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv in September 2024. The protest was related to the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The coffins were not for dead Israeli soldiers, but rather a symbolic representation of the hostages.

The first memorials to the victims of the [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks")
 in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of [webmasters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/webmaster "wikt:webmaster")
 posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
 Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The first reading of the names of the victims of 9/11 took place at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2002.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Names-2)

The _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ was the first major physical memorial at the [World Trade Center site](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site "World Trade Center site")
. A permanent memorial and museum, the [National September 11 Memorial & Museum](/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum "National September 11 Memorial & Museum")
 at the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973‚Äì2001)")
, were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with 30-foot (9.1¬†m) waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials have been constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was [Pier A](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Pier_A_Park "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
 in [Hoboken, New Jersey](/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey "Hoboken, New Jersey")
. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called [Hoboken Island](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Hoboken_Island "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
, was chosen in September 2004.

_[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
_, the monumental and world's largest cast [bronze sculpture](/wiki/Bronze_sculpture "Bronze sculpture")
 of modern times created by German artist [Fritz Koenig](/wiki/Fritz_Koenig "Fritz Koenig")
 stood between the twin towers on the [Austin J. Tobin](/wiki/Austin_J._Tobin "Austin J. Tobin")
 Plaza of the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973‚Äì2001)")
 in New York City from 1971 until the terrorist attacks on [September 11, 2001](/wiki/September_11,_2001 "September 11, 2001")
. The artefact, weighing more than 20 tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers after the attacks. Since then, the bronze sphere, primarily known in the United States as _The Sphere_, has been transformed into a symbolic memorial to commemorate [9/11](/wiki/9/11 "9/11")
. Having become a major [tourist attraction](/wiki/Tourist_attraction "Tourist attraction")
, the unrestored sculpture was rededicated on August 16, 2017, by the [Port Authority](/wiki/Port_Authority_of_New_York_%26_New_Jersey "Port Authority of New York & New Jersey")
 at a permanent location in [Liberty Park](/wiki/Liberty_Park_(Manhattan) "Liberty Park (Manhattan)")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Ground_Zero_cross.jpg/250px-Ground_Zero_cross.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ground_Zero_cross.jpg)

The [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
 was a temporary memorial at Ground Zero.

Soon after the attacks, temporary memorials were set up in New York and elsewhere.

*   On October 4, Reverend Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest, blessed the [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
    , two broken beams at the crash site which had formed a cross, and then had been welded together by iron-workers.
*   On October 13, the [North Charleston Coliseum](/wiki/North_Charleston_Coliseum "North Charleston Coliseum")
     raised a special banner featuring the retired number of [Mark Bavis](/wiki/Mark_Bavis "Mark Bavis")
    , who was on United Airlines Flight 175. Bavis had played for the ECHL's [South Carolina Stingrays](/wiki/South_Carolina_Stingrays "South Carolina Stingrays")
    , and his retired number hangs in a special corner, independently from the Stingrays' retired numbers (#14, #24) and awards banners (1997 and 2001 Kelly Cup Championships), with the years he played for the team (1994‚Äì96), the date of his death (September 11, 2001), and an American flag.
*   Also on October 13, The [September 11 Photo Project](/wiki/September_11_Photo_Project "September 11 Photo Project")
     was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community-based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historic preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled "The September 11 Photo Project" in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
*   On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture _[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
    _, formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in [Battery Park City](/wiki/Battery_Park_City "Battery Park City")
    .[\[3\]](#cite_note-Sphere-3)
    

#### In other countries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In other countries")\
\]

In Europe, annually a commemoration of September 11 to never forget, [Nissoria](/wiki/Nissoria "Nissoria")
 was one of the first public places that dedicated a memorial to September 11 in Europe. Nissoria is in a small town located in the Province of Enna in Sicily, Italy. Two family members of this community, Vincenzo DiFazio and Salvatore Lopez, died on Sept 11 at the World Trade Center.

The then-mayor Dr. Marco Murgo along with the Chiara family Benito Sr. and son Mario developed the project to dedicate a small plot of land adjacent to a local school and museum that was entitled ‚ÄúParco 11 Settembre‚Äù. The Commanding Officer of the nearby U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella met with this delegation from Nissoria and embraced this truly heartfelt initiative.

Ever since its dedication, and thanks to the present-day Mayor of Nissoria Dott. Armando Glorioso and Dott. Alberto Lunetta who continues this important event, a representation of both American and Italian military personnel from the nearby Military base NAS Sigonella comes to visit and annually commemorate along with all local Italian Authorities, Dignitaries and citizens who truly will never forget this tragic event.

*   According to [Radio Farda](/wiki/Radio_Farda "Radio Farda")
    's website, when the attacks' news was released, Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news on Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, the [United States Department of State](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State")
    , published a post on its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
     After the attacks, the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran condemned the attacks. [BBC](/wiki/BBC "BBC")
     and [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")
     published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens on their websites.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

Memorial at [Fort Bragg](/wiki/Fort_Bragg "Fort Bragg")
 in 2019, featuring over 7,000 boots, representing military service members killed since the September 11 attacks

The National 9/11 Flag was made from a tattered remains of a 30-foot (9.1¬†m) American flag found by recovery workers in the early morning of September 12, 2001. It was hanging precariously from some scaffolding at a construction site next to Ground Zero. Because of safety reasons the flag could not be taken down until late October 2001. Charlie Vitchers, a construction superintendent for the Ground Zero cleanup effort, had a crew recover the flag. It was placed in storage for seven years.[\[109\]](#cite_note-dnainfo.com-109)

The flag has made a number of appearances across the country, including a Boston Red Sox Game, a New York Giants Home Opener, and the USS _New York_ Commissioning Ceremony. It also appeared on the CBS Evening News and on ABC World News Tonight "Persons of the Week."[\[110\]](#cite_note-110)

The flag began a national tour on Flag day, which was on June 14, 2009. It visited all 50 states where service heroes, veterans, and other honorees each added stitching and material from other retired American flags in order to restore the original 13 stripes of the flag. The flag now resides at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)
[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)
[\[113\]](#cite_note-113)

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for "learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future." The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor's POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)"To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001." (2)"To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered." (2)"To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: "This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them" The Flag of Heroes reads: " This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan's Inwood Hill Park September 8‚Äì12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks.[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)
 The flags were also featured on [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")

 and on [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")
 affiliate [WVEC](/wiki/WVEC "WVEC")
 in Norfolk, Virginia.[\[116\]](#cite_note-116)

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as _[Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life")

*   Celestial Requiem NYC (Second Life)[\[117\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-117)

> On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

9/11 Memorial in Israel

[![9/11 memorial in Israel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.israelpharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9-11-memorial.jpg)
We wanted to share something with you, something that is not widely known to many Americans (and not all Israeli‚Äôs either).  
In Israel we have a dedicated memorial to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Not only does it stand out poignantly on a hill in the middle of Israel, near Jerusalem, but the base is made out of 9/11 twin tower wreckage. It cost more than $2 million to make and was orchestrated by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).  
Unfortunately Israel knows how to build memorials and monuments. In this small country with so much turbulence, we know only too well the suffering of those who die needlessly in these terrorist attacks. This memorial is known simply as the ‚Äú9/11 Memorial Plaza‚Äù.  
Here are some interesting facts about the 9/11 Memorial Plaza.

*   The memorial Plaza was completed in 2009 for $2 million, by the JNF.
*   It sits on 5 acres of hillside, 20 miles from the center of Jerusalem, not a small monument at all. It overlooks Jerusalem‚Äôs largest cemetery, Har HaMenuchot.
*   The memorial monument is in the shape of a 30-foot, bronze American flag that has been built in the shape of a flame to commemorate the flames of the Twin Towers.
*   The base is made out of melted twin tower wreckage.
*   Surrounding the main monument are plaques listing the names of all the people who died as a result of the attacks. Even though the memorial stands in Israel and only 5 Israel citizens died as a result of the attacks the memorial lists ALL the victims who perished. It is the only memorial outside the US which lists ALL of those who died in the attacks.

Times are turbulent and the entire Middle East is going through vast changes. Some say the relationship between the US and Israel is in trouble‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ whatever happens, there will always be a special relationship between the US (in particular New York) and Israel.  
A powerful memorial‚Ä¶ so the world never forgets.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

[](https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newarab.com%2Fanalysis%2Fwhy-barcelona-reversed-its-decision-cut-ties-israel&title=)

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil‚Äôs Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)
 in May.

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council.¬†

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

> "The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from city councils around the world"

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona‚Äôs twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty‚Äôs alleged ‚Äúhate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state‚Äù.¬†

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight ‚Äúdiscrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens‚Äù.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity ‚Äì reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors ‚Äì the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

‚ÄúACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,‚Äù a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM‚Äôs sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel‚Äôs occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona‚Äôs city council and part of Ada Colau‚Äôs party ‚ÄòBarcelona En Com√∫‚Äô, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

‚ÄúThere is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience‚Ä¶ until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate‚Äù.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that ‚Äúwe can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system‚Äù.¬†He adds that ‚Äúwhat they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand‚Äù.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona‚Äôs ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni‚Äôs administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that ‚Äúthere has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region‚Äù.¬†

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona‚Äôs synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau‚Äôs decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,‚Äù they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. ‚ÄúI think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights‚Äù.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

‚ÄúCollboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,‚Äù he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party‚Äôs recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel‚Äôs far-right government is concerning. They added that, ‚Äúthese crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least¬†[219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona‚Äôs recent decision is that ‚Äúeverything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians‚Äù.¬†

**Bianca Carrera is a freelance writer and analyst specialising in Middle Eastern and North African politics, as well as environmental matters, at Sciences Po Paris. Some days later, the party also headed a [proposal to re-establish ties](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ca/mandat-2019-2023/accio-de-govern/el-consell-municipal/acords-del-plenari/35184)
 in a council plenary session. He made clear that the move was on his agenda, but associations claim they were not told it would be a priority within his mandate.¬†

The group that was behind Barcelona‚Äôs solidarity campaign with Palestine, ‚ÄòProu Complicitat‚Äô, or ‚ÄòEnough Complicity‚Äô, told _The New Arab_ that Collboni‚Äôs Socialist Party later met with the Palestine solidarity movement.

‚ÄúIn this meeting, they acknowledged that their reaction to the suspension was hasty and that they overreacted. \[Getty\]

**Pro-Israel interest groups and the Spanish right**

ACOM was founded in 2004 by businessman David Hatchwell, and is now presided over by the CEO of the international insurance company AmTrust Europe, Angel Mas."

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of ‚Äú[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")

Laporte invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against the Manchester United team as part of the European League and to give the embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

Protesters hold banners and wave Palestinian flags during an anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian rally in Barcelona on January 20, 2024 (LLUIS GENE / AFP)

Barcelona‚Äôs city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing alleged violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, called for an end to all official relations with Israel ‚Äúuntil respect for international law‚Äù and the ‚Äúbasic rights of the Palestinian people‚Äù are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with the liberal coastal city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organizer Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

Barcelona‚Äôs move came a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel‚Äôs military operations in Gaza amid the war sparked by the Hamas terror group‚Äôs devastating attack on October 7, 2023.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with representatives of the Israeli Embassy. This event occurred in February 2023, not September 2024. The evidence also confirms that Barcelona's city council voted to cut ties with the Israeli government in May 2024, citing the ongoing war in Gaza. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date and the context of the event.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, ‚ÄúBREAKING Netanyahu‚Äôs residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah ‚Äî Israel Hayom.‚Äù

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, ‚ÄúNetanyahu‚Äôs residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone‚Ä¶On target.‚Äù

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu‚Äôs home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, ‚ÄúWhy, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu‚Äôs taxes?‚Äù

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: ‚ÄúPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs private residence in Caesarea.‚Äù

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video‚Äôs title, translated from Hebrew, reads, ‚ÄúThe villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.‚Äù

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into ‚Äúsuspected abuse‚Äù of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas‚Äôs unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel‚Äôs retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in¬†[Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: ‚ÄúDo you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?‚Äù

The video‚Äôs Hebrew-language title translates to English as: ‚ÄúA year for the government: a survey of mandates‚Äù.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz¬†[reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

'Squad' member shares fake poll claiming most Israelis support rape of Palestinians
===================================================================================

by KRISTINA WATROBSKI | The National Desk

Updated Fri, August 9th 2024 at 3:36 PM

![UserWay icon for accessibility widget](/resources/defaults/news_3.0/icons/accessibility/userway-transparent.svg)

![FILE - Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")
 shared by users. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., also [condemned](https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962 "https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962")
 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X."

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls ‚ÄúSwords of Iron‚Äù ‚Äî the genocide of the last ten months and counting.¬†

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel‚Äôs mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers.¬†

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis¬† ‚Äúoppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,‚Äù even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution.¬†

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having ‚Äúhigh trust‚Äù in the reports of the military spokesperson ‚Äúthroughout the war in Gaza‚Äù ‚Äî an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn‚Äôt include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points.¬†

So this is yet another unbelievable data point ‚Äî gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it‚Äôs Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia).¬†

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about ‚Äúdisciplinary measures‚Äù here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here ‚Äî only ‚Äúbad behavior,‚Äù at worst.¬†

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture ‚Äî they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. In addition to wishing a ‚Äúregulated policy‚Äù of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù be ‚Äúexecuted according to law.‚Äù And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be ‚Äúhandled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.‚Äù

The survey asked the question:

> ‚ÄúRecently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?‚Äù¬†

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‚Äúthey should stand criminal trial‚Äù; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn‚Äôt know.¬†¬†

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B‚Äôtselem in their report ‚Äú[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.‚Äù High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. There is almost nothing they can do to Palestinians that the Jewish Israeli public would consider criminal, and hardly any Israelis would consider them ‚Äúhuman animals‚Äù for thinking like that.¬†

_Correction: The story originally incorrectly said that ‚Äú28% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‚Äòthey should stand criminal trial.'‚Äù The correct percentage is 21%. The story has been updated._

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, asked about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll's subject was different.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, did not ask the question presented in the image, but rather asked about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism. The claim is therefore demonstrably false.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) ‚Äì The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship‚Äôs visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney‚Äôs visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney‚Äôs port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
‚ÄúThe purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it‚Äôs to continue to build on our interoperability, it‚Äôs to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,‚Äù said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. ‚ÄúWe are indeed stronger together.‚Äù  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO‚Äôs premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a ‚Äúfree-play‚Äù portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, T√ºrkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
‚ÄúWhat we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,‚Äù says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. ‚ÄúThis really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That‚Äôs our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.‚Äù  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship‚Äôs corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships‚Äô medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year‚Äôs successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

German Reconnaissance Company

WASHINGTON¬†¬†‚Äì¬†¬†

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO¬†‚Äî¬†a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans ‚Äî and the world.¬†

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO ‚Äî still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance ‚Äî a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. ‚Äî with less than a third of the U.S. population ‚Äî lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany ‚Äî with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies ‚Äî primarily the U.S. ‚Äî answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general ‚Äî Britain's Lord Ismay ‚Äî said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations ‚Äî from Albania to Slovenia ‚Äî hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values ‚Äî and our willingness to stand up for them ‚Äî is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression ‚Äî knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 ‚Äî the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades ‚Äî NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation ‚Äî forcefully deposing a freely elected government ‚Äî then other neighboring nations may be endangered. ¬†"Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris¬†on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen." ¬†

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism ‚Äî of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide ‚Äî built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II ‚Äî remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match ‚Äî and that none should doubt."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS¬†_New York_¬†(LPD-21) and USS¬†_Oak Hill_¬†(LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

US bolsters military presence in Middle East as threat of regional escalation intensifies
=========================================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

Washington is bracing for Iran and its allies to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which Tehran blames on Israel

*   [See all our Middle East coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast)
    

The US military will deploy additional fighter jets and navy warships to the Middle East, the Pentagon said on Friday, as Washington braces for Iran and its regional allies to make good on a promise to respond to the killing of [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas)
 leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

After the back-to-back assassinations of [Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/31/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-death-raid-iran-home-israel-gaza-war)
 and top [Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says)
 the evening before, international diplomats have scrambled to head off a full-fledged regional war. Israel successfully [knocked down almost all of the roughly 300 drones and missiles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/14/how-irans-attack-on-israel-was-stopped)
 with the help of the US and other allies.

It is thought that the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon could present unique challenges to any efforts by the US to intercept drones and missiles given the group‚Äôs vast arsenal and immediate proximity to Israel.

On Friday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the country was ‚Äúin a state of very high readiness for any scenario‚Äù. Rising tensions have spurred a growing list of major airlines into cancelling flights to Tel Aviv or Beirut, including Lufthansa, Delta and Air India.

On Friday France urged its citizens to leave Iran and Cyprus said it had expanded plans to support a large-scale evacuation from the region if the war expands. The island nation helped tens of thousands of people leave during the 2006 war between [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 and Hezbollah.

The US defence secretary, [Lloyd Austin](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/lloyd-austin)
, approved sending the additional Navy cruisers and destroyers ‚Äì which can shoot down ballistic missiles ‚Äì to the Middle East and Europe on Friday and the US will also send an additional squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East.

‚ÄúAustin has ordered adjustments to US military posture designed to improve US force protection, to increase support for the defence of Israel and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies,‚Äù the Pentagon said in a statement.

The US military previously intensified deployments prior to 13 April, when [Iran launched an attack on Israeli territory](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/14/middle-east-crisis-visual-guide-to-irans-attack-on-israel)
 with drones and missiles. On Friday [crowds gathered in Qatar‚Äôs capital, Doha, to bury Haniyeh](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/02/hamas-leader-buried-in-doha-as-biden-says-killing-has-not-helped-ceasefire-efforts)
, a day after a prayer ceremony in Tehran for the Hamas leader, who was the group‚Äôs chief negotiator in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza.

The US president, Joe Biden, who has pushed hard for a ceasefire in recent months, said the killing was ‚Äúnot helpful‚Äù, in comments to journalists at a US airbase late on Thursday.

Biden added that he had a ‚Äúvery direct‚Äù conversation with Netanyahu about the need to reach a deal. He should move on it and they should move on it now.‚Äù

[The war in the Middle East is escalating fast ‚Äì and Biden has squandered too many chances to stop it | Mohamad Bazzi\
\
Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/02/gaza-israel-iran-joe-biden-middle-east)

On Friday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable.

‚ÄúI think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don‚Äôt want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an offramp here, and that is that ceasefire deal,‚Äù Singh said.

An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Netanyahu‚Äôs office said on Friday.

Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri commented on the announcement, telling Reuters: ‚ÄúNetanyahu does not want to stop the war and is using these empty statements to cover up his crimes and evade their consequences.‚Äù

US to send jets and warships as Iran threatens Israel

The US will deploy additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said.

Tensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Missile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was "ironclad".

Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed "harsh punishment" against Israel for the assassination of Haniyeh.

The Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. increase support for the defence of Israel, and ... Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in Gaza that has killed almost 40,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The circumstances surrounding Haniyeh's death are, as yet, still unclear.

On Saturday, [the Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/02/mossad-hired-iranian-agents-to-plant-bombs-haniyeh-rooms/)
 reported that Iranian agents hired by Israel's Mossad spy agency had planted bombs in a building where Haniyeh was staying.

The newspaper says that two agents placed bombs in three rooms of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp guesthouse in Tehran, which were detonated from abroad.

An earlier report by [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 said that the bombs had been snuck into the building two months earlier.

The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.

* * * Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented.

Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza war.

His death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed Fuad Shukr, the top military commander of Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.

A Pentagon statement said the new deployments would "improve US force protection... ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies".

The deployments would include additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, it said.

High alert
----------

On Tel Aviv‚Äôs seafront, the mood appears relaxed with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas.

But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full- scale war.

Israel is on high alert.

Several international airlines have suspended flights to the country.

Meanwhile, Israeli ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on communication infrastructure.

Earlier on Saturday, Israeli forces killed a Hamas operative in the West Bank.

Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed in strikes on Gaza in the last 24 hours - a reminder that Israel‚Äôs war in the region continues even as diplomats scramble to prevent its escalation.

The US military has stepped-up deployments before, on 13 April when Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles. Israel and its allies shot down almost all of roughly 300 drones and missiles that were fired.

Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Haniyeh. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered "crushing blows" to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of Shukr in Beirut.

He warned Israelis that "challenging days lie ahead... We are prepared for any scenario".

Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable.

"I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don't want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off-ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal," Singh said.

An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Mr Netanyahu said on Friday.

Hamas sparked the war with its 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. we have heard threats from all sides."

There had been speculation that the Pentagon might not replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group in the Middle East once it completed its ongoing deployment. Still, the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon could present unique challenges to any efforts by the United States to intercept drones and missiles given the group's vast arsenal and immediate proximity to Israel.

The image in the claim shows military ships at sea. However, the reverse image search reveals that the image was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea, and is related to the exercise Baltic Operations 2024. Therefore, the image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim is false.

The image is found on a website called DVIDS ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)) and a U.S. government website ([https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The USNI News article from August 2, 2024, reports that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean, potentially for non-combatant evacuation from Lebanon. The NPR article, published on August 3, 2024, states that the U.S. is deploying ships and fighter jets to the Middle East to defend Israel. The Guardian article from August 3, 2024, mentions that the U.S. military will deploy additional Navy cruisers and destroyers to the Middle East.

The articles discuss the U.S. increasing its military presence in the Middle East due to rising tensions. The articles can be found here: [https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel), [https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5062390/us-military-deployment-middle-east-israel-iran](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5062390/us-military-deployment-middle-east-israel-iran), and [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/us-bolsters-military-presence-in-middle-east-as-threat-of-regional-escalation-intensifies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/us-bolsters-military-presence-in-middle-east-as-threat-of-regional-escalation-intensifies). <image:12865>, <image:12883>, <image:12885>, <image:12888>, <image:12889>, <image:12890>


### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, the U.S. sent additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran, according to the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo)). The Pentagon also announced the deployment of additional Navy warships to the Middle East to increase support for the defense of Israel ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/)). The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower was mentioned in the Reuters article. <image:12897>, <image:12898>, <image:12899>


## Elaboration
The image in the claim shows military ships at sea. However, the reverse image search reveals that the image was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea, and is related to the exercise Baltic Operations 2024. Therefore, the image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim is false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. The image was taken in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not in August 2024 near Lebanon. The image is also not related to supporting the IDF. `false`

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, ‚ÄúDo not test our capabilities ‚Äî we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!‚Äù

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani‚Äôs Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him‚Äîyet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani‚Äôs role expanded after Qasem Soleimani‚Äôs 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran‚Äôs experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel‚Äôs use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani‚Äôs escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share‚§¥](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post references an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and another in civilian disguise, suggesting an escape tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025. The post also mentions that The New York Times claimed Qaani was killed, but his reappearance challenges that narrative. <image:57> is included in the post.

Afghan Officials: Iran‚Äôs New Quds Chief Likely Faked Identity in 2018

Print

Afghan officials say they are investigating a visit in 2018 of the new commander of Iran‚Äôs elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, to the province of Bamiyan where he claimed to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul.

Qaani, a 61-year-old brigadier general, became the chief of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), following the U.S. Esmail Qaani was in charge of QF operations in Central Asia while \[Soleimani\] himself was busy fighting the Americans, Israel and IS in Iraq, Lebanon and Levant.‚Äù

According to Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, Iran since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 has recruited thousands of Afghans into what is known as the Fatemiyoun battalion. killing of Qassem Soleimani Friday in an airstrike.

Shortly after his appointment, Afghan media circulated pictures showing him paying an official visit to Bamiyan province in July 2018, allegedly as Iran‚Äôs deputy ambassador.

The governor of Bamiyan, Mohammad Tahir Zuhair, who appeared in one of the photos giving Qaani a local tapestry, told VOA that Qaani introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat visiting the province to reiterate Iran‚Äôs support for the local government.

‚ÄúLet me emphasize again that no foreign delegation ever comes to this province without Kabul coordinating the visit. We were told by Kabul that an Iranian delegation would oversee the process of building a hospital in Bamiyan,‚Äù Zuhair told VOA.

The governor said officials in Kabul instructed the local government to provide Qaani and his team with security and logistics assistance.

‚ÄúThe Iranian delegation spent about 45 minutes in the hospital and then came to my office and we met. He said that they came to Bamiyan to tell the people that Iran liked to help them,‚Äù he told VOA.

At the time of his visit to Bamiyan, Qaani was serving as the deputy commander of the Quds Force under Soleimani.

**Why the visit?**

Afghan officials say that Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan, raising questions about the intentions of his visit to the predominately Shiite province in central Afghanistan.

‚ÄúWe are investigating the exact nature and date of his visit. At this point I can assure you that he was never the deputy ambassador in Afghanistan,‚Äù Idrees Zaman, Afghanistan‚Äôs acting foreign minister, said in a press conference Tuesday.

Some Afghanistan analysts like Jonathan Schroden, the director of Center for Stability and Development at Washington-based research and analysis organization CNA, are charging that Iran might have arranged for the alleged disguise to prevent the Afghan government‚Äôs monitoring.

‚ÄúIt is hard to say whether he was actually traveling under a false title in this case; it‚Äôs possible that Iran could have named him as a DCM, if even temporarily, in whatever travel documents he had, etc., in order to provide him official cover for his travel,‚Äù Schroden said.

He however expressed some skepticism over the alleged disguise, saying it is unlikely that Iran‚Äôs commander could hide behind a bogus identity given his high-profile status for years in Iran and the wider region.

**Recruitment**

Other experts say Qaani‚Äôs visit could be seen as an effort to mobilize Shiite people to support the Quds Force, given Iran‚Äôs previous efforts to gain influence among Shiites in Afghanistan.

Regional experts say it was Qaani‚Äôs duty to actively recruit for the Quds Force among Shia populations in Afghanistan.

Farzin Nadimi, an associate fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VOA that one of Iran‚Äôs main targets has been to establish a foothold in the Shiite areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He added that it is generally believed that ‚Äúhis \[Soleimani\] deputy, Gen."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is associated with Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. The image appears on a Nigerian forum, which discusses Qaani's disguise. A VOA article mentions Qaani using a fake identity. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the image's authenticity or the reason for the disguise.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it identifies Qaani in the image. However, the reason for the disguise, as stated in the claim, is not directly confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, in disguise. The post references an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes two images of Qaani, one in military attire and another in civilian disguise, suggesting an escape tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025. The post also mentions that The New York Times claimed Qaani was killed, but his reappearance challenges that narrative. <image:57> is included in the post.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article about Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, and mentions criticism from Trump and the US. The article also mentions unverified reports concerning Qaani's death. (<image:i>) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)

Another source from journalist.net lists journalists who cover Esmail Qaani. (<image:12902>) [https://journalist.net/journalists/by-people/esmail-qaani](https://journalist.net/journalists/by-people/esmail-qaani)

A Voice of America (VOA) article discusses Esmail Qaani's visit to Bamiyan province in Afghanistan in 2018, where he introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat. The article includes a photo of Qaani. (<image:57>) [https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is associated with Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. The image appears on a Nigerian forum, which discusses Qaani's disguise. A VOA article mentions Qaani using a fake identity. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the image's authenticity or the reason for the disguise.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it identifies Qaani in the image. However, the reason for the disguise, as stated in the claim, is not directly confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

A VOA article mentions Qaani using a fake identity. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the image's authenticity or the reason for the disguise.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it identifies Qaani in the image. However, the reason for the disguise, as stated in the claim, is not directly confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris‚Äôs actions labelled ‚Äòa disgrace‚Äô
*   Fears athletes can become ‚Äòvictims of political disputes‚Äô

Judo‚Äôs governing body is to investigate why Algeria‚Äôs Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel‚Äôs Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become ‚Äúvictims of broader political disputes‚Äù.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for ‚Äúsmartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight‚Äù.

One of the Algerian athletes‚Äô sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: ‚ÄúDris won everyone‚Äôs respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.‚Äù

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: ‚ÄúI think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria‚Äôs Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

‚ÄúFollowing the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,‚Äù the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.‚Äù

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) ‚Äî The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men‚Äôs 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

‚ÄúFollowing the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,‚Äù the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

‚ÄúWe believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,‚Äù the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli
=================================================================================================

             ![FILE - Victor Sterpu of Moldova, background and Tohar Butbul of Israel compete during their men's -73kg round of 16 judo match at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Monday, July 26, 2021.

‚ÄúI think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,‚Äù Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul‚Äôs third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel‚Äôs presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel‚Äôs offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France‚Äôs government have firmly backed Israel‚Äôs right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel‚Äôs first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel‚Äôs Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.‚Äù

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria‚Äôs fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

Sderot Mayor Alon Davidi tells residents to stay in their homes behind locked doors and not open them until instructed otherwise, as Israeli security forces work to find and apprehend an unknown number of Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated this morning from Gaza into Israeli communities and gunned down people in the streets and in their homes.

Davidi decries the ‚Äúmassacre of innocent civilians everywhere,‚Äù and calls for Israel‚Äôs leadership to deal a significant blow to Hamas.

‚ÄúWe need to take over Gaza and kill them, they need to be erased,‚Äù he tells Channel 12.

Sirens warning of incoming rockets are sounding in Kibbutz Be‚Äôeri in southern Israel where Israeli security forces and Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated into the kibbutz from Gaza are engaged in a gun battle.

The Barzilai Medical Center in the city was hit by a rocket launched from the Gaza Strip amid the ongoing, unprecedented attack on Israel.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

‚ÄúIn Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,‚Äù Germany‚Äôs Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. ‚ÄúThe federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.‚Äù

Germany‚Äôs authorities are also closely watching ‚Äúpotential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,‚Äù she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country‚Äôs regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

‚ÄúAt a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,‚Äù he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a ‚Äúvisible and systematic static presence,‚Äù and the use of soldiers from France‚Äôs Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

#### [Hamas official: Our attack has only just begun](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-official-our-attack-has-only-just-begun/)

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group‚Äôs onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the ‚ÄúAl-Aqsa Deluge‚Äù by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must ‚Äúleave our occupied lands.‚Äù

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that ‚Äúwe are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.‚Äù

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

By [AFP](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/afp/ "AFP")

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is ‚Äúvital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.‚Äù

Martin says he could ‚Äúsee tensions rising‚Äù during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today‚Äôs attack is ‚Äúquite shocking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúMy sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that‚Äôs why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúSo what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it‚Äôs a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today‚Äôs attack.‚Äù

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use ‚Äúall the power‚Äù of the IDF to destroy Hamas‚Äôs capabilities, and tells Gaza‚Äôs residents to ‚Äúget out now.‚Äù

Calling today‚Äôs events something ‚Äúnever before seen in Israel,‚Äù he vows to ensure ‚Äúit will never happen again.‚Äù

He begins by saying Hamas ‚Äúinvaded Israeli territory this morning,‚Äù and started a ‚Äúcruel and evil war,‚Äù targeting innocent civilians young and old.

‚ÄúWe will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúHamas wants to murder us all,‚Äù Netanyahu says, ‚Äúmurdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

‚ÄúIt is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,‚Äù an enemy ‚Äúthat massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision.

Israel will target Hamas everywhere ‚Äî turning the places it ‚Äúhides and operates‚Äù into ‚Äúcities of ruin.‚Äù

US President Joe Biden backs Israel‚Äôs right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

‚ÄúToday the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we‚Äôll make sure that they‚Äôll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,‚Äù Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

‚ÄúThe world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities‚Ä¶ Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It‚Äôs unconscionable.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsrael has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There‚Äôs never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration‚Äôs support for Israel‚Äôs security is rock solid and unwavering.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.‚Äù

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to ‚Äúmake sure Israel has what it needs.‚Äù

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

‚ÄúLet there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,‚Äù Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

‚ÄúHe was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else ‚Äî including today, on this tragic morning,‚Äù says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, ‚ÄúI unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population‚Ä¶ are in themselves an aggression,‚Äù Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a ‚Äúcolonial‚Äù entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

‚ÄúI am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúViolence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.‚Äù

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker T√ºrk, condemns the terror attacks.

‚ÄúI am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,‚Äù T√ºrk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN‚Äôs special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn‚Äôt been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

At the time, Goldberg-Polin‚Äôs parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn‚Äôt understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They‚Äôd last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

‚ÄúHe had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,‚Äù said Polin, who didn‚Äôt know anything specific about his son‚Äôs plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn‚Äôt usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son‚Äôs who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night ‚Äúnature party‚Äù near Kibbutz Re‚Äôim.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

‚ÄúOne list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,‚Äù Polin says. ‚ÄúBut he wasn‚Äôt at any of those places.‚Äù

Friends were at the couple‚Äôs home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven‚Äôt been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

‚ÄúThey think there‚Äôs still a bunch of people hiding in the area,‚Äù Polin says, adding that the mother of his son‚Äôs friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. ‚ÄúEvery time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There‚Äôs very little we can actually do.‚Äù

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas‚Äôs general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri (YouTube screenshot)

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group‚Äôs onslaught against Israel an ‚Äúopen battle‚Äù aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived ‚Äúdesecration‚Äù of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem ‚Äî known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims ‚Äî by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified ‚Äúnew reality‚Äù at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are ‚Äúabout to be freed,‚Äù anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are ‚Äúsenior officers.‚Äù He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians ‚Äúhumanely.‚Äù Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

‚ÄúWe have a plan for all stages of this conflict,‚Äù al-Arouri says, ‚Äúboth in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.‚Äù He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the ‚Äúbest scenario‚Äù for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his ‚Äúhope and trust‚Äù that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight ‚Äúto defend Al-Aqsa,‚Äù especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

‚ÄúWe entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,‚Äù he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon‚Äôs territory.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would ‚Äúdeal with security challenges alone‚Äù and in a manner that would allow ‚Äúsubstantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums‚Äù for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing ‚Äúfor any responsible and determined security action.‚Äù

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join ‚Äúa reduced, professional, emergency government‚Äù and says it would be impossible to manage a war with ‚Äúthe extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,‚Äù essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group‚Äôs massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

‚ÄúAt this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,‚Äù the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the ‚Äúgigantic failure‚Äù of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, ‚Äúat this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.‚Äù

The White House slams a Republican ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù campaign blaming the Biden administration for today‚Äôs Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

‚ÄúNot a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,‚Äù says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

‚ÄúThese funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,‚Äù she adds.

Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and S√©rgio Fran√ßa Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

‚ÄúIt is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,‚Äù Erdan writes.

‚ÄúIsrael expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas‚Äô war crimes and genocidal agenda.‚Äù

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

‚ÄúThe State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúWe will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.‚Äù

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be‚Äôeri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom‚Äôs Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife‚Äôs phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

‚ÄúI have seen my wife‚Äôs phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,‚Äù he told the Kan public broadcaster. ‚ÄúI contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.‚Äù

Israeli activists in the US launch a crowdfunding campaign to assist residents of southern Israel.

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

‚ÄúWe join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,‚Äù organizers say. ‚ÄúThis is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.‚Äù

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

The Israeli consulate in New York also says it is accepting all offers of help and support.

‚ÄúPrior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,‚Äù the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an ‚Äúemergency government‚Äù to manage ‚Äúthe difficult and complex operation ahead of us‚Äù after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

‚ÄúThe State of Israel is at war. It won‚Äôt be easy and it won‚Äôt be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven‚Äôt seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,‚Äù Lapid says in an announcement.

‚ÄúA short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I‚Äôm willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.‚Äù

Netanyahu, he says, ‚Äúknows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can‚Äôt manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúForming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,‚Äù says Lapid.

‚ÄúThe State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren‚Äôt managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won‚Äôt deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.‚Äù

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that ‚Äúthe offer is real, this isn‚Äôt a political thing. The offer is there.‚Äù

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

‚ÄúI think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse ‚Äî of their ending‚Äù ‚Äî that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. ‚ÄúEveryone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.‚Äù

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are ‚Äúnot even relevant anymore,‚Äù he says, and negotiations ‚Äúunder or over the table‚Äù will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel‚Äôs northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

‚ÄúEither they‚Äôre going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúStarting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties‚Ä¶ but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn‚Äôt go into a major ground operation, it‚Äôs the end of this government‚Äôs political life,‚Äù says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces‚Äô top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be‚Äôeri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is ‚Äúcompletely unified.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAll Israel‚Äôs citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no coalition and opposition now,‚Äù Gantz adds, ‚Äújust a single fist that will pound the enemy.‚Äù

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part ‚Äúwill be making a terrible mistake.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen‚Ä¶ and pray for the recovery of all the injured.‚Äù

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. ‚ÄúIsrael can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,‚Äù Gantz says.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group‚Äôs attack on Israel rises to more than 100, Hebrew-language media cite medical officials as saying.

The number is seen as certain to rise further.

Some 800 people have been wounded in the attacks, which have included hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

Ra‚Äôam‚Äôs Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra‚Äôam party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: ‚ÄúIn light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.‚Äù

‚ÄúI urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.‚Äù

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be‚Äôeri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing ‚Äúlots of gunfire‚Äù nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife‚Äôs phone ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt answer ‚Äî to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving ‚Äúfar more successful‚Äù from Hamas‚Äôs perspective than it would have expected, the TV station‚Äôs Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn‚Äôt know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran‚Äôs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a ‚Äúproud operation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,‚Äù Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

‚ÄúWe support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,‚Äù says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists ‚Äúuntil the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.‚Äù

Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúThe resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people‚Äôs struggle against the Zionists.‚Äù

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted ‚ÄúDown with Israel,‚Äù ‚ÄúDown with America,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWelcome Palestine,‚Äù according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire ‚Äî while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

Saudi Arabia calls for an ‚Äúimmediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint‚Äù amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‚Äòrepeatedly warned‚Äô of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its ‚Äúrepeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.‚Äù

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a ‚Äúcredible peace process‚Äù to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

‚ÄúToday we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day.

‚ÄúThe State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúI call upon the family of nations ‚Äì this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are ‚Äúmurderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople still don‚Äôt understand the numbers‚Äù and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many ‚Äúbodies on the ground‚Ä¶ terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.‚Äù

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

Here is the post in full:

‚ÄúHorrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

‚ÄúTerror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror‚Äôs victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

‚ÄúAnyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs right to self-defense is unquestionable.

‚ÄúAll details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

‚ÄúAll Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

‚ÄúTo support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

The European Union ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù condemns the ‚Äúterrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,‚Äù adding that it was ‚Äúterrorism in its most contemptible form.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsrael has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,‚Äù she adds.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: ‚ÄúThey are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.‚Äù

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how this is still going on. We‚Äôre in this situation since 6 a.m.,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFour people cannot fight them off alone

‚ÄúSend help, please,‚Äù she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources.

There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!‚Äù

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: ‚ÄúWith rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,‚Äù she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls ‚ÄúOperation Al-Aqsa Flood.‚Äù

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúdesecration‚Äù of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

‚ÄúToday, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,‚Äù he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel ‚Äúset the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.‚Äù

He further calls on the ‚ÄúIslamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon‚Äù ‚Äî countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran ‚Äî to ‚Äúmerge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,‚Äù and ‚Äústart marching towards Palestine now.‚Äù

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nations to join ‚ÄúOperation Al-Aqsa Flood.‚Äù

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: ‚ÄúHezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel‚Äôs Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.‚Äù

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah‚Äôs statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera‚Äôs Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group‚Äôs fighters had launched the missile ‚Äúto aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.‚Äù He also claimed it had struck a ‚Äúmilitary target.‚Äù

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:58> This image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, in July 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:58>)
web_search("Houthi attack Tel Aviv July 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:58>) appears in multiple articles. One article from LBC Group ([https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en)) from July 19, 2024, reports an explosion in a Tel Aviv building, with bomb disposal experts on the scene. Another article from India.com ([https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/](https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/)) from October 22, 2024, reports that Hezbollah fired 20 rockets at Tel Aviv. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/)) also includes the image in a live blog about the ongoing attacks.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack, claimed by the Houthi movement, targeted an apartment building. The drone was not intercepted due to human error. Another source mentions a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on the same date, also claimed by the Houthi militia, resulting in one death and four injuries. <image:58>
Additionally, the New York Times reports a missile attack in Tel Aviv in December 2024, launched by Houthi militants from Yemen.

## Elaboration
The claim is supported by the evidence. The image depicts the aftermath of an attack in Tel Aviv. The web search results confirm a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which aligns with the image's context. The reverse image search also links the image to articles about an explosion in Tel Aviv.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the aftermath of an attack in Tel Aviv, and the web search results confirm a Houthi drone attack on July 19, 2024. Therefore, the claim is factually accurate. `true`

## Summary

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats.¬†

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider.¬†

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their ‚ÄúUAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force‚Äù attacked ‚Äúone of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv‚Äù.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military‚Äôs chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

‚ÄúWe are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,‚Äù Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT ‚Äî¬†

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world ‚Äî one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don‚Äôt need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey‚Äôs military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community‚Äôs failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad‚Äôs use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he¬†has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria‚Äôs chemical arsenal with Russia‚Äôs cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad‚Äôs success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad‚Äôs success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\]¬†Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein‚Äôs regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt‚Äôs and, later, North Korea‚Äôs help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years‚Äîuntil it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime‚Äôs use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project‚Äôs methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users‚Äô calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government‚Äôs response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons‚Äô psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria‚Äôs use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government‚Äôs use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria‚Äôs experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in ‚Äúfalse flag‚Äù attacks, nonstate actors‚Äô lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad‚Äôs calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt‚Äôs main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government‚Äôs regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense‚Äîincluding DTRA‚Äîshould support the development of evidence collection technologies such as ‚Äúdrone sniffers‚Äù and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department‚Äôs CBW and DTRA‚Äôs Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA‚Äôs Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military‚Äîand psychological‚Äîeffects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors‚Äîincluding adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India‚Äîwould want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW‚Äôs Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

Content: "Tillerson: Russia 'ultimately bears responsibility' for chemical attacks in Syria
=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

U.S. ambassador to the [United Nations](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm)
 [Nikki Haley](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/nikki-haley.htm)
 joined Tillerson in his condemnation of Russia, releasing a paper statement that said, "This attack in Syria should weigh heavily" on Russia's "conscience."

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:61> appears in multiple sources. According to a VOA News article ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)), the image shows a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant's face at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on January 22, 2018. An article from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east](https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east)) also includes the image and mentions the same event.

An ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)) also features the image and discusses the U.S. stance on chemical attacks in Syria, mentioning a chlorine gas attack in east Ghouta. The ABC News article also includes images of destruction in Syria <image:5772> and of Rex Tillerson <image:5768>.


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant's face at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on January 22, 2018, according to VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)) and CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east](https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east)).

The claim that the image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024 is incorrect. The evidence indicates the image is from Syria and dates back to 2018.

The claim's description of the scene is not verifiable with the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is from Syria and dates back to 2018, not Gaza in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. Therefore, the claim is false. `false`

## Summary

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris ‚Äì from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekin√∂z√º in the Kahramanmara≈ü province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his ‚Äî and his nation's ‚Äî grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his ‚Äî and his nation's ‚Äî grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

CNN ¬†‚Äî¬†

It‚Äôs been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week‚Äôs tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

‚ÄúIt was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt save my daughter,‚Äù Hancer said.

‚ÄúLosing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,‚Äù he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,‚Äù she was crushed, he said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn‚Äôt have a chance of survival.‚Äù

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter‚Äôs body from the rubble.

‚ÄúWith my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn‚Äôt ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,‚Äù he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country‚Äôs disaster agency.

‚ÄúI also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,‚Äù Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother‚Äôs house, where his daughter was staying.

‚ÄúMy mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,‚Äù Hancer said.

Hancer‚Äôs home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to stay. ‚ÄúWe cannot enter our house because we don‚Äôt have the means. We are left outside.‚Äù

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government‚Äôs response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of ‚Äúnegligence‚Äù over building collapses due to last week‚Äôs earthquake.

 and Palestinian health officials.[\[b\]](#cite_note-12)
[\[11\]](#cite_note-13)
 The operation's objective was to recover hostages taken during the [7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel](/wiki/7_October_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")

 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. [Ynet](/wiki/Ynet "Ynet")
 reported that she also cooked at times with basic ingredients she was provided.[\[36\]](#cite_note-The_Times_of_Israel-2024c-38)

 (the militant wing of the Hamas movement) claimed that three other hostages were killed as a result of the raid.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera_Arabic-2024-24)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)
 They did not name any of them, or show photographs, but they claimed that one of the three was a US citizen and released a short video with text in Arabic, Hebrew, and English.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera_Arabic-2024-24)
 The video depicted three unidentifiable corpses with their faces obscured by censor bars.[\[42\]](#cite_note-44)
 The Brigades did not give details of how the hostages supposedly died, but said they were killed by the Israeli military.[\[c\]](#cite_note-46)

Videos taken at the scene of the attack on the UNRWA school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat showed twisted metal at the collapsed building. Emergency workers also tried to cover two bodies as they were quickly brought into the medical complex.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement that 50 injured Palestinians were taken to the hospital.

Israeli air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16

Shock and horror at scene of Gaza blast

**At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured.**

The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel said it had struck several Hamas ‚Äúterrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School‚Äù.

A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were "very, very serious" and should be investigated.

The attack comes as [hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3gvp5q9y2go)
, following months of false starts.

Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas.

It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to "pretty significant adjustments" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire.

A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war.

Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded.

Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.

The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter.

One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit.

"This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning," she said.

Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Many were women and children."

She added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated.

A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat [killed at least 35 people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crggq0jygq6o)
.

Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school.

After that attack, Israel‚Äôs military said it had ‚Äúconducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound‚Äù in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.

The head of the Unrwa described the June incident as "horrific" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was "shocking" but could not be confirmed.

Israel‚Äôs war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.

The organisation has rejected this.

In April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

At least 50 people were injured in the strike, Gaza officials say.

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken "numerous steps" to "mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence".

Hamas militants were using the location as a "hideout" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said.

"Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel," it added.

Hamas called the attack a ‚Äúmassacre‚Äù on ‚Äúdefenceless displaced civilians‚Äù.

Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel.

The IDF said it was "looking into the details" of the incident.

Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.

"We don‚Äôt have all the information yet. <image:2684>!Reuters People walk through the ruins of a school that was hit by an airstrike, killing at least 16 people. Since the war began, we have had more than half of our facilities hit," Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.

"Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted.

More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders.

Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, [said](https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1833976405149057277)
 the evacuation was a "highly complex operation" that was "completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together."

A WHO [report](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-09-2024-who-analysis-highlights-vast-unmet-rehabilitation-needs-in-gaza/)
