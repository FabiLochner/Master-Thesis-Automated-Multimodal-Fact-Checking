Useful result: From [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/26/middleeast/israeli-strikes-yemen-sanaa-houthis-intl): 
Content: The CNN article, published on December 27, 2024, reports on Israeli strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa and the western city of Hodeidah on December 26, 2024, which resulted in casualties. <image:5> The article also mentions a missile launched from Yemen that hit Tel Aviv on December 21, 2024.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While the U.S. was involved in strikes against Yemen in December 2024, the claim doesn't fully capture the context. The strikes were a joint effort with the U.K. and were in response to attacks on Israel, but the image's specific date and context are not fully verified by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
