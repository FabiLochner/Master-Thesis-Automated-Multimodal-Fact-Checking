Useful result: From [Source](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad): Found exact image on website with title: Ayman al-Zawahiri's Life in Jihad and Al-Qaeda After His Death
Content: The article, published on July 31, 2023, by Kyle Orton, discusses the life of Ayman al-Zawahiri and the current state of Al-Qaeda. It mentions that al-Zawahiri was killed in an airstrike in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022. <image:26> The article also mentions that the house where al-Zawahiri was killed was in the Sherpur area of Kabul. The article also mentions that the Haqqani Network, a group within the Taliban, is closely tied to the ISI, which means Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment knew where Al-Qaeda's leader was and tried to shield him from America.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. This is how a precision strike looks like: a single missile through the window, and only Haniyeh and his bodyguard are dead. Nobody else in the building is even injured.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is associated with the killing of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a US drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022, as reported by the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/)) and News18.com ([https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html](https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html)). The image depicts the building where the strike occurred, not the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.
