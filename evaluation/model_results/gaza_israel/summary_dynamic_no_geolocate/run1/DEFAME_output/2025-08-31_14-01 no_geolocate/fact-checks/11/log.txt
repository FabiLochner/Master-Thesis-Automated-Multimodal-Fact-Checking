The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, the IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, was not assassinated. A fact-check by Yahoo News, originally from USA TODAY, explicitly states that the claim is false and provides evidence, including photos of Halevi visiting the base after the attack ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-israels-defense-chief-not-213141242.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-israels-defense-chief-not-213141242.html)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
