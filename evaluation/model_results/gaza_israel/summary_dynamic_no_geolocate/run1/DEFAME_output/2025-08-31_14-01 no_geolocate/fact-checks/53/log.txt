Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, threatening those holding hostages in the Middle East. The post, made on July 25, 2024, does not mention Israel or Hamas by name, but warns of severe consequences if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025. <image:11568>, <image:11567>, <image:11569>.

The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an assassination attempt on him on July 13, 2024, the evidence, including a search result from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/)), does not support the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
