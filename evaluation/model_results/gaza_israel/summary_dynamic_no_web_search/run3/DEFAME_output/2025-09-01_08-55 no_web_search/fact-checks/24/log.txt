Content: The Canadian Press News article discusses the claim that UNRWA placed a black band on its social media profiles in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar. The article includes an image of the UNRWA logo. <image:14102>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996): 
Content: The DW article fact-checks a claim about UNRWA. The article includes a screenshot of an UNRWA X post from October 22, 2023, which does not show a black band. <image:14103>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. A search for the UNRWA X profile did not show a black band on the profile photo. A DW article fact-checking a related claim included a screenshot of an UNRWA X post from October 22, 2023, which did not show a black band, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
