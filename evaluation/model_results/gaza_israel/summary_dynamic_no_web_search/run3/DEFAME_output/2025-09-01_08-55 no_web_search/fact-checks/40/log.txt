The claim 'In June 1936, Columbia University expelled student activist Robert Burke for leading an anti-Nazi demonstration.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially verified. Evidence from [blurredbylines.com](https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/) and a New York Times article confirms Robert Burke's expulsion from Columbia University and his involvement in an anti-Nazi demonstration. However, the exact date of the expulsion in June 1936 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence, making the claim only partially verifiable.

So, the overall veracity is: false
