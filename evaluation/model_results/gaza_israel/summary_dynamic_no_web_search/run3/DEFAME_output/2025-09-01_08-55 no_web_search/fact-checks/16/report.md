One source from Samsung Mobile Press ([https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge](https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge)) shows the Samsung Olympic Games Pin ![image 14077](media/2025-09-01_09-01-1756717304-173939.jpg).

Another source from Samsung Newsroom ([https://news.samsung.com/global/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge](https://news.samsung.com/global/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge)) shows a boy holding a board with Olympic pins ![image 14078](media/2025-09-01_09-01-1756717305-256053.jpg). Olympics.com ([https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/paris2024/win-limited-edition-paris-2024-souvenirs-with-pinquest](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/paris2024/win-limited-edition-paris-2024-souvenirs-with-pinquest)) shows a box with the word "PARIS" on it ![image 14079](media/2025-09-01_09-01-1756717306-149993.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of synchronized swimmers and Olympic pins. One image shows synchronized swimmers spelling out a message, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts the Israeli Olympic team or that they were prohibited from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins. The evidence does not mention the Israeli Olympic team or the "Bring Them Home" pins.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to a lack of information.
