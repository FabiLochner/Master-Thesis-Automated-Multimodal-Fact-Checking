The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Iran launched missile strikes on Israel around October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland. In fact, a video from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/](https://www.theguardian.com/)) shows Netanyahu responding to the attacks, indicating he remained in Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
