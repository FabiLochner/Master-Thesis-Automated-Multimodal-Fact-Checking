The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While there is evidence of an assassination attempt on Donald Trump and the US provides financial aid to Israel, there is no evidence to support the claim that Jewish Americans orchestrated the assassination plot or that Israel wants American servicemen to fight Iran.

So, the overall veracity is: false
