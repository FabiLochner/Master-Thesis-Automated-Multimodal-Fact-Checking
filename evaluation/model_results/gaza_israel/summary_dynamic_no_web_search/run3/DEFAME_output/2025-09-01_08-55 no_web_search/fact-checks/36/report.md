## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after the alleged date of his death. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that Gallant postponed a visit to Washington, and NPR published an article with his image on November 5, 2024. Therefore, the claim that Gallant was killed on October 1, 2024, is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Yoav Gallant was alive after the date of the alleged attack. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that Gallant postponed a visit, and NPR published an article with his image on November 5, 2024. This contradicts the claim that he was killed on October 1, 2024.
