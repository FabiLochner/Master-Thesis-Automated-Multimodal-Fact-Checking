image_search("US warships Lebanon coast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows multiple military ships at sea. The image was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea during the BALTOPS 24 exercise. The USS Mount Whitney was also present in the exercise.

The image is available on the DVIDS website ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)) and on a U.S. Department of Defense website ([https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/)). ![image 55](media/86.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
Business Insider shows a U.S. Navy warship (![image 14329](media/2025-09-01_09-26-1756718803-327703.jpg)). The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including an image of a U.S. aircraft carrier (![image 14330](media/2025-09-01_09-26-1756718803-530947.jpg)). Fox News contains an image of a U.S. warship (![image 14331](media/2025-09-01_09-26-1756718803-666676.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The image in the claim shows a fleet of ships participating in the BALTOPS 24 exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, not en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim is therefore inaccurate regarding the location and the date. The image search results confirm the presence of U.S. warships in the Middle East in August 2024, but do not support the claim's specific details.


## Final Judgement
The image is from the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim misrepresents the location and date of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts a naval exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, as confirmed by reverse image search results from the DVIDS website ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)). This contradicts the claim that the image shows U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.
