## Claim
Claim: "![image 33](media/58.jpg) This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
geolocate(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (![image 14230](media/2025-09-01_09-15-1756718100-323018.jpg)). NPR also contains an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (![image 14231](media/2025-09-01_09-15-1756718101-000285.jpg)). Al Jazeera published aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (![image 14232](media/2025-09-01_09-15-1756718101-884482.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could be from Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation data. The image search results confirm that there has been destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim is from Gaza or that it was taken in December 2024.

To verify the claim, I would need to confirm the exact location and date the image was taken.


## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza December 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Vatican News published an article about airstrikes in Gaza in December 2024, which includes an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (![image 14233](media/2025-09-01_09-15-1756718125-663803.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article on December 31, 2024, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (![image 14234](media/2025-09-01_09-15-1756718126-004553.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was destruction in Gaza in December 2024. However, the images found in the search results do not match the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot confirm the claim's veracity. I would need to find the exact source of the image to verify its location and date.


## Final Judgement
The image search results confirm that there was destruction in Gaza in December 2024. However, the images found do not match the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While evidence from sources like Vatican News and Al Jazeera confirms destruction in Gaza in December 2024, the images found do not match the one in the claim.
