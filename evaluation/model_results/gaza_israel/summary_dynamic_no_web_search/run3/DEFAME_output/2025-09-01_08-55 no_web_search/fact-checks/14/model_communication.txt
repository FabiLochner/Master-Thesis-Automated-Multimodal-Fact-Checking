In a shocking incident in the National Capital Region, a young man, Ashu, suffered severe burns when his toilet exploded. His father, Sunil Pradhan, reported that Ashu sustained 35% burns and was hospitalized. Authorities suspect methane gas buildup from clogged drains as the cause, though the spark's origin remains unclear.

A bizarre and frightening accident took place in the National Capital Region of the country, when a usual visit to the bathroom turned into a nightmare for a young man who suffered some serious injuries as his home’s toilet exploded!Ashu’s father, Sunil Pradhan, described the horrifying moment, “The blast left Ashu with severe burn injuries to his face and body. He was rushed to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, where doctors confirmed he had suffered 35% burns,” said a TOI report. Importantly, he clarified that Ashu wasn’t using any mobile phone or electronic gadget at the time, ruling out some common theories like gadget explosions.While this might sound like something from a bizarre news column, this kind of accident could actually happen anywhere, especially in homes with aging or poorly maintained plumbing systems.

Poll

Do you believe that regular maintenance of plumbing systems can prevent accidents like toilet explosions?

Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessary

What really happened?  

------------------------

According to early assessments, the explosion was not triggered by electrical issues. The home’s air conditioning and all other appliances were functioning properly at the time. But the real reason behind this blast was the least expected but potentially dangerous cause, the methane gas buildup.The family suspects that methane may have accumulated inside the toilet bowl due to a clogged drain, and a spark might have ignited the gas, leading to the explosion, though the source of the spark is unclear.

![Representative Image](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms)

Local resident Harinder Bhati shared his concerns, saying, “Pipes here are not just old, but they haven’t been cleaned in years. Choked pipes can lead to the accumulation of gas, which can explode under pressure.” This sentiment was echoed by experts, including a chemistry professor, who explained that methane can indeed collect in sewer lines and confined bathroom spaces, particularly where ventilation is poor or drains are blocked.Despite the alarming nature of the incident, AP Verma, a senior manager of the Greater Noida Authority, stated, “The system is clean and functioning normally. It appears that the explosion might have resulted from some internal problem within the house.” However, he did not clarify what those internal problems could be.

Why could this happen anywhere?  

----------------------------------

This incident is a wake-up call about how aging plumbing, poor ventilation, and neglected sewage maintenance can create dangerous conditions even in modern homes. While such explosions are rare, it is advised that homeowners regularly inspect and clean their plumbing systems, especially in older buildings, to prevent dangerous gas buildup.

Montreal electronic traffic signs altered to display pro-Palestinian slogans
============================================================================

The message boards, which normally advise motorists of roadwork, were tampered with to display phrases such as "free Palestine," "escalate now," and "globalize the intifada." By the end of Wednesday morning, the original messages had been restored at the sites.

Group claimed responsibility online, saying act shows 'solidarity with Palestine'

![An electronic traffic message board reads, Free Palestine, Escalate now. ](https://i.cbc.ca/1.7274812.1721903270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/mtl-pirated-signs-20240724.jpg?im=Resize%3D780)

Some in Montreal’s Jewish community are looking for answers after electronic traffic signs at two different construction sites in the city displayed the political slogans “free Palestine” and “escalate now” in an apparent hack. (HO-Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs/The Canadian Press)

Montreal police are investigating after electronic message boards at two road construction sites in the city displayed pro-Palestinian political slogans Wednesday morning instead of usual traffic alerts.

The message boards, which normally advise motorists of roadwork, were tampered with to display phrases such as "free Palestine," "escalate now," and "globalize the intifada." By the end of the morning, the original messages had been restored at the sites.

Intifada, which means "shaking off" in Arabic, was coined to describe an uprising against Israel's military occupation that erupted in 1987. What became known as the first intifada was marked by widespread Palestinian protests and a fierce Israeli response.

In the second uprising, which began in 2000, Palestinian militants carried out deadly suicide bombings on buses and at restaurants and hotels, eliciting crushing Israeli military reprisals.

Eta Yudin, Quebec vice-president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the messages on the traffic signs an incitement to violence against Jews because she said "intifada" refers to terror attacks.

Her organization wants police to investigate what happened and measures to be put in place so it does not happen again. She said "hijacking" signs that are meant to provide safety information to drivers with any kind of political message "raises huge alarm bells as to what these people are willing to do."

*   [ICJ says Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal](/news/world/icj-israel-occupation-ruling-1.7266424)
    

The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. It said the signs in question belong to a private contractor hired by the city and are the responsibility of the contractor.

City spokesperson Gonzalo Nunez said in an email that padlocks on the signs were broken, allowing someone to program the unauthorized messages. He said that soon after it was noticed, the original messages were restored.

A group called Clash Mtl has claimed responsibility, writing on Instagram that it carried out the act during the night with the goal of showing "solidarity with Palestine." The group did not respond to a request for comment.

A Montreal police spokesperson said by email that they are aware of the situation and are investigating. The city administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Not a call for violence
-----------------------

Niall Clapham Ricardo with Independent Jewish Voices disputed that the messages are a call for violence, saying the slogans refer to a desire to end the violence and dispossession of Palestinians in the occupied territories as Israeli strikes continue to claim thousands of lives in Gaza.

Clapham Ricardo says part of the problem is that many wrongfully associate all Palestinian resistance with suicide bombing.

"We have to get out of this binary of freeing Palestine means violence against Jews. It doesn't, and as long as we see it in that binary, there's always going to be more violence. There's always going to be more war," he said.

McGill University political science professor Rex Brynen also says the Arabic word "intifada" does not inherently imply violence or non-violence and should therefore be understood as more of a rallying cry for protest.

Montreal police are investigating after electronic message boards at two road construction sites in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian political slogans Wednesday morning instead of usual traffic alerts.

The message boards that normally advise motorists of roadwork were tampered with to display phrases such as “free Palestine,” “escalate now,” and “globalize the intifada.” By the end of the morning, the original messages had been restored at the sites.

Intifada, which means “shaking off” in Arabic, was coined to describe an uprising against Israel’s military occupation that erupted in 1987. What became known as the first intifada was marked by widespread Palestinian protests and a fierce Israeli response.

In the second uprising, which began in 2000, Palestinian militants carried out deadly suicide bombings on buses and at restaurants and hotels, eliciting crushing Israeli military reprisals.

Eta Yudin, Quebec vice-president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the messages on the traffic signs an incitement to violence against Jews because “intifada” refers to terror attacks.

Her organization wants police to investigate what happened and measures to be put in place so it does not happen again. She said “hijacking” signs that are meant to provide safety information to drivers with any kind of political message “raises huge alarm bells as to what these people are willing to do.”

The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. It said the signs in question belong to a private contractor hired by the city and are the responsibility of the contractor.

City spokesperson Gonzalo Nunez said in an e-mail that padlocks on the signs were broken, allowing someone to program the unauthorized messages. He said that soon after it was noticed, the original messages were restored.

A group called Clash Mtl has claimed responsibility, writing on Instagram that it carried out the act during the night with the goal of showing “solidarity with Palestine.” The group did not respond to a request for comment.

A Montreal police spokesperson said by e-mail that they are aware of the situation and are investigating. The city administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Niall Clapham Ricardo with Independent Jewish Voices disputed that the messages are a call for violence, saying the slogans refer to a desire to end the violence and dispossession of Palestinians in the occupied territories as Israeli strikes continue to claim thousands of lives in Gaza.

Clapham Ricardo says part of the problem is that many wrongfully associate all Palestinian resistance with suicide bombing.

“We have to get out of this binary of freeing Palestine means violence against Jews. It doesn’t, and as long as we see it in that binary there’s always going to be more violence. There’s always going to be more war,” he said.

McGill University political science professor Rex Brynen also says the Arabic word “intifada” does not inherently imply violence or non-violence and should therefore be understood as more of a rallying cry for protest.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, which was the result of a hack and considered vandalism by the city, as reported by [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809) and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/). The claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images of synchronized swimmers and Olympic pins. One image shows synchronized swimmers spelling out a message, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts the Israeli Olympic team or that they were prohibited from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins. The evidence does not mention the Israeli Olympic team or the "Bring Them Home" pins.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to a lack of information.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Another source from Samsung Newsroom ([https://news.samsung.com/global/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge](https://news.samsung.com/global/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge)) shows a boy holding a board with Olympic pins <image:14078>. Olympics.com ([https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/paris2024/win-limited-edition-paris-2024-souvenirs-with-pinquest](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/paris2024/win-limited-edition-paris-2024-souvenirs-with-pinquest)) shows a box with the word "PARIS" on it <image:14079>.


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of synchronized swimmers and Olympic pins. One image shows synchronized swimmers spelling out a message, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts the Israeli Olympic team or that they were prohibited from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins. The evidence does not mention the Israeli Olympic team or the "Bring Them Home" pins.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to a lack of information.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image of synchronized swimmers spelling "Bring Them Home Now" is not from the Olympics. The claim that the Israeli Olympic team created the image at the 2024 Olympics because they were not allowed to wear "Bring Them Home" pins is false.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

Content: The search result from Ynetnews.com contains an image of synchronized swimmers. <image:763>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss the Samsung Olympic Games Pin and other Olympic souvenirs. One source from Samsung Mobile Press ([https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge](https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge)) shows the Samsung Olympic Games Pin <image:14077>.

Another source from Samsung Newsroom ([https://news.samsung.com/global/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge](https://news.samsung.com/global/paris-2024-samsung-puts-a-new-spin-on-a-long-standing-tradition-with-the-samsung-olympic-games-pin-masters-challenge)) shows a boy holding a board with Olympic pins <image:14078>. Olympics.com ([https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/paris2024/win-limited-edition-paris-2024-souvenirs-with-pinquest](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/paris2024/win-limited-edition-paris-2024-souvenirs-with-pinquest)) shows a box with the word "PARIS" on it <image:14079>.


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of synchronized swimmers and Olympic pins. One image shows synchronized swimmers spelling out a message, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts the Israeli Olympic team or that they were prohibited from wearing "Bring Them Home" pins. The evidence does not mention the Israeli Olympic team or the "Bring Them Home" pins.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to a lack of information.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu- X

**Washington:** President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end.

Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month.

“I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,” Trump told reporters on Monday.

[![MS Teachers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20336%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](//forms.gle/Ra71M9QCEdsnn5uP8)

The leaders’ talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalisation deal and concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda.

Netanyahu’s arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump’s second term comes as the prime minister’s popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centres on allegations he exchanged favours with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a “witch hunt”.

Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu’s standing.

It’s Netanyahu’s first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defence minister and Hamas’ slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The US does not recognise the ICC’s authority over its citizens or territory.

Netanyahu and Trump’s Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement.

Netanyahu said in statement that the meeting with Witkoff and US National Security Adviser Michael Waltz was “positive and friendly”.

[![Germanten Hospital](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20336%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](//www.germantenhospitals.com/?ref=siasat.com)

The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel’s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week.

Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu’s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn’t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections.

Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces’ full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.

Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may “have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.”

“The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That’s what he got,” Resnick said. “He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.”

Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement.

Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

“I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,” said Zangauker, who travelled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. “We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.”

Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the US provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu’s government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.

Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu’s desire to land a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.

The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

“This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,” Telhami said. “It’s hard to see the Saudis going along with it.”

Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel.

The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran’s air defences. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran’s nuclear programme.

“This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,” said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on US-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. “What’s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.”

Following a recent boxing match between Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, a widely shared photo surfaced showing Tyson posing with a Palestinian flag before the fight. This image garnered significant attention and commentary on social media. However, Fact Crescendo’s fact-checking team revealed that the photo circulating on Facebook was generated by artificial intelligence.

**Social Media Claim**

An image of American boxing legend Mike Tyson alongside the Palestinian flag has been widely shared on social media recently, suggesting he supports the Palestinian people.

Below is a screenshot of a Facebook post from November 16, 2024, with a caption in Khmer stating, “Mike Tyson poses with the Palestinian flag before a fight.”

**Fact Check**

Fact Crescendo verified these images using Google Reverse Image Search and AI verification tools. Then, we discovered the following facts.

By running an AI-generated image detector, we discovered that the photo was not authentic. It was created by artificial intelligence (AI) rather than being a real photograph of an actual event.

The findings revealed that the image shown in the photo was entirely generated by AI technology, rather than being captured in reality.

 | [Archived Link](https://archive.vn/6sQc8)

Fact Crescendo also searched Getty Images, a reputable source for authentic photos, and found several images of Mike Tyson before and during the fight. None of these photos showed Tyson holding a Palestinian flag.

This further disproves the claim, as it suggests that no legitimate images from the event feature Tyson with the flag. This reinforces the fact that the original photo shared on social media was not genuine.

The Fact Crescendo team, a group dedicated to verifying and fact-checking claims, also watched the livestream of the highly anticipated fight between Jake Paul, a well-known social media personality turned boxer, and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. This event, which took place on November 16, was reportedly streamed on Netflix, a popular streaming platform known for airing documentaries and films, though typically not live sports events. 

After carefully reviewing the stream, the team observed no instance where Mike Tyson, the legendary boxer, was seen wearing a Palestine flag, contrary to certain claims that circulated online. The Fact Crescendo team has found no evidence or visual confirmation that Tyson posing that at all.

Carlos María de Cerón y Castro. Kiev, Ukraine.

Five years ago I was blessed with my first field assignment with the United Nations. Since then I have devoted myself to the humanitarian efforts that exemplifies the best aspects of the UN.

Over the last months I have had the opportunity to be part of numerous field visits to Ukraine. It was during those memorable visits that I fell in love with the country and its people. It suddenly became a burning desire to be assigned to Ukraine on a more permanent basis.

Today, the OSCE has deemed me professionally and personally capable of undertaking a new assignment in the Ukraine.

I look forward to this new challenge and I thank the Ukrainian people for welcoming me to their wonderful country.

I hope to see you all soon and welcome you to visit me in the Ukraine!

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote in "[The Natural Consequences Of](https://www.63rdfloor.com/post/the-natural-consequences-of-hamas-attack)
 Hamas' [Attack](https://www.63rdfloor.com/post/the-natural-consequences-of-hamas-attack)
" that the despicable terrorist attack of Hamas preordained the Israeli bombing and incursion into Gaza. Even with time to think and to hear a contrary view from someone whose motives and heart are pure, I stand by every word I wrote. The blood of every Gazan who has died is on Hamas' hands.

  

But one thing she brought to my attention demanded serious consideration. What should Israel do next?

  

Whatever the answer, the overriding imperative should be a just peace with full security guarantees. Without peace, it will be next to impossible for Israel to continue as a democratic Jewish homeland. If the goal, out of an understandable desire for vengeance, is only to destroy Hamas, then Israel should heed the warning from the great Chinese philosopher Confucious - “Those who seek revenge must dig two graves."

  

![Gravestone with outline of Israel](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_c5e3da143e32495d83547b520e5f5cf0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_103,h_116,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_c5e3da143e32495d83547b520e5f5cf0~mv2.jpg)

  

Before answering, I need to lay out my ground rules. My paramount interest is what is good for Israel and for Jews. How it affects Hamas, Hezbollah, and their fellow travelers is of no concern to me. Their fate is irrelevant. Nor are the historic grievances of Palestinians my concern. Yes, they have been mistreated by everyone, including Israel, and have been used as political footballs by Arab leaders to distract their citizens from rightful grievances. But Jews have lived in the Land of Israel for millennia, and there has never been a Palestinian State. Additionally, the beliefs or positions of other Arab countries hold no moral authority; they have rejected a two-state solution too often.

![Map of UN 1948 Partition Plan Rejected By Arab Countries](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_42d551fd1dde4c369b61ee112a0cdde2~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_94,h_164,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_42d551fd1dde4c369b61ee112a0cdde2~mv2.jpg)

Palestine in yellow)

  

But most of all, I give no credence to the opinions of those who are quick to condemn Israel with such vitriol and to ignore the evil of others. They were silent when the Syrian Government of Bashar al-Assad attacked its own citizens with chemical weapons. [Estimates of the death toll ranged from 281 people to 1,729.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack)
 They were silent when a Saudi Arabia-led coalition invaded Yemen. That war has killed an estimated 377,000 people, has contributed to the [famine in Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_Yemen)
, which has threatened over 17 million people, and caused an [outbreak of cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Yemen_cholera_outbreak)
 that has infected hundreds of thousands. They were silent when, in 1991, 287,000 Palestinians were forced by the [Kuwaiti security forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_Military_Forces)
 to leave Kuwait.

  

Apparently, the deaths of citizens of Syria or Yemen do not matter. Nor do the lives of Palestinians seem to matter if Israel is not involved. Or maybe they are only incensed when it is Jews doing the killing or expelling?  

There are only two intertwined interests that need to be considered - the State of Israel and, by necessity, the Palestinians. There is an old saying that “If my Grandmother had wheels, she’d be a bicycle.” You deal with the world as it is, not as you hope it to be. Put another way, Israel cannot act as if the Palestinians do not exist.

  

Israel is situated in a dangerous neighborhood, and that is not going to change soon. The historic grievances against Israel, whether justified or not, are not going to disappear. There is no chance that without some monumental change, anyone will ever just let ‘bygones be bygones'. Even if Israel kills every member of Hamas, without change, there will be another terrorist organization to take its place.  

What is next after the attack on Hamas needs to be at the forefront.

  

When considering alternatives, I am drawn to thoughts attributed to four individuals. The first is Confucious ' warning to those who seek vengeance.

  

The second is the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin was no peacenik. When faced with the Intifada in 1987, he instructed Israeli soldiers to break Palestinian arms and legs. Yet, when asked why he was entering into an agreement with the PLO and Yasser Arafat, he responded,

> “You don't make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies.”

  

The third is Ben Franklin, who observed that “Out of Adversity Comes Opportunity.”

  

The last, and the most important, is the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. Upon meeting Egyptian President Anwar Sadat when he arrived in Israel, she said,

> “I can forgive you for killing my boys, but I can never forgive you for making our boys kill yours.”

Prime Minister Meir recognized that for each death that a soldier causes, no matter how subjectively justified, a little of the soldier's soul also dies with the heart commensurately hardening. Being a warm, caring, and compassionate person is not conducive to being able to engage in even a fully justified war. These characteristics are antithetical to war’s goal – kill the enemy.

![ree](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_9087b13c69414aeebde564ed35e6f087~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_96,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_9087b13c69414aeebde564ed35e6f087~mv2.jpg)

  

The same is true for nations. Although not made of skin and bone, nations also have souls. This idea goes back to Plato, who, in The Republic, opined that a state is infused with a soul that resembles that of its citizens. How just a state acts, how it treats outsiders, who it treats as important, what values it cherishes, and what it considers evil are all considerations defining the soul of a nation. For every country, there is hopefully a constant fight for what the historian [Jon Meacham](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38385947-the-soul-of-america)
 calls the battle for our better angels.

  

That battle is difficult enough when the nation is at peace and not faced with war or another existential crisis. Nations, like people, have survival instincts. Especially nations that have been at war since their founding are surrounded by countries who have pledged to push them back into the sea and were founded partially as a refuge for survivors of Hitler’s Final Solution. It becomes too easy for a national response to a brutal and unjustified attack to focus on the short-term imperative of rescue or prevention without taking into account long-term implications. When it is believed that your very survival is threatened, your vision becomes myopic and focused on the here and now.

  

For Israel, the short-term goal must be determined with the long-term in mind. I do not doubt that Israel wants to live peacefully with its neighbors. The terms of that peace may be debatable, but those who think otherwise ignore the treaties Israel has signed and lived up to with past perennial enemies, Egypt and Jordan. Whether the desire comes from altruism or cold calculations is irrelevant.

  

All but the most hardened rightists understand that the Palestinians are not going anywhere. Indeed, other Arab nations will not welcome them. The West Bank was under the control of Jordan for almost 20 years, yet no Palestinian state was formed. Egypt exercised identical control of Gaza. Palestinians have nowhere to go. They are Israel's problem.

  

Without a viable peace between Israel and Palestinians, Israelis will live on a continual war footing with all that this means for their economy and nation's psyche. Israel is not looking to occupy Gaza with a continuous military occupation. This is why they unilaterally left Gaza in 2005, along with the forced dismantling and evacuation of 21 Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. Eight thousand Jewish settlers from the 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip were forcibly relocated.

  

![Israeli Soldiers, in 2005, forcibly removed settlers from Gaza](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_d44ce4ead22d46569f5d8c5286a722c7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_30,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_d44ce4ead22d46569f5d8c5286a722c7~mv2.jpg)

Israeli soldiers, in 2005, forcibly removed settlers from Gaza.

  

Their rationale for leaving was calculated and not based on what was good for Gazans. A primary reason was an understanding of demographic realities and the costs of a continued occupation. Then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in an address on the day that Israel ceded control of Gaza, stated,

> "It is no secret that, like many others, I had believed and hoped we could forever hold onto \[the settlements of\] Netzarim and Kfar Darom. But the changing reality in the country, in the region, and the world required of me to reassess and change of positions. We cannot hold on to Gaza forever. Over 1 million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers with every generation.”

  

At the same time, then Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres confirmed that

> “We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography.”

  

Israel's dilemma was that it could not occupy Gaza without an occupation that would require brutality that the nation was not willing to undertake. Nor was Israel willing to change its character as a Jewish State by making a million predominantly Muslim Arab citizens. The choice was between maintaining Israel as a democracy or a Jewish State. Faced with equally unacceptable alternatives, even a hawk, like Prime Minister Sharon knew there had to be a third way. Israel just had to leave.

  

Almost twenty years later, Israel is on the verge of forgetting why it left Gaza. Hamas has given no indication that it is going down easily, and Israel has at least publicly committed itself to stay in Gaza for as long as it takes to destroy Hamas. Even if it takes years. In those years, Israel will correctly be viewed by Gazans as an occupying force. Israel will be responsible for the feeding, housing, and medical care of every Gazan. Israel will be held accountable for all that is wrong, regardless of genuine fault. If anyone doubts who will be blamed, remember how quickly most of the world wrongly accused Israel of the explosion at Gaza City’s Ahli Arab Hospital.

  

The author, Thomas Friedman, published an [interesting opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/opinion/biden-speech-israel-gaza.html)
 in which he pleaded with the Israeli Government to pair its incursion into Gaza with an honest and public diplomatic pursuit of a two-state solution. Friedman feared that the situation would quickly spin out of everyone’s control, endangering Israel's relations with Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, dooming treaties with other Arab nations, and, at the same time, irreparably injuring American interests.

  

I do not always agree with Friedman, but this time he is right. Which brings me to Ben Franklin and Confucius as representatives of the possible polar outcomes. Franklin's statement that “out of adversity comes opportunity” is the more optimistic. Any optimism flows from the realization that the Arab / Muslim world is not monolithic, and there was a real possibility before the Hamas attack that Israel would normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and others. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank are reluctant allies if they are allies at all. Hamas is primarily a Sunni Muslim organization. Iran has funded and armed Hamas despite their religious differences to destabilize the region.

  

The lack of a unified Arab response was highlighted when, on November 11th, a joint summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League unsurprisingly condemned Israel but was unable to agree on any sanctions. [The objections of four major countries prevented the imposition of any concrete measures to back the condemnation.](https://www.newarab.com/news/disagreements-led-joint-arab-oic-gaza-summit-riyadh)
  

Hezbollah, which controls Israel’s northern border, is Shiite Muslim and backed by Shiite Iran. In a recent address, the leader of Hezbollah spewed the usual rhetoric that one would expect but stayed clear of any commitment to any meaningful widening of the conflict. However, Hezbollah has fired dozens of rockets at some Israeli positions in a disputed area near the border. There have also been limited infiltrations of Hezbollah forces reported. Thankfully, there have only been minimal causalities on both sides.

  

What can bring these disparate interests into a firm alliance and widen/worsen the conflict in other parts of Israel is the inability of Israel to envision an end game other than revenge or punishment for the Hamas terrorist attack.

  

The situation has not been made any better by reciprocal escalation on the Israeli side. Militant Israelis on the West Bank have used the Hamas attack as justification for attacks of their own. [According to the United Nations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/west-bank-settlers-palestinians-violence.html)
, since October 7th, attacks on Palestinians have left 115 dead, more than 2,000 injured, and nearly 1,000 others removed from their homes. Israeli hardliners will also use the Hamas attack to bury even the slight chance for a two-state solution.

  

When Israel pulls its troops out of Gaza, it will not matter that they have killed every member of Hamas if the conditions that helped spawn Hamas are still present or have even worsened. An insightful [article by Anthony Cordesman](https://www.csis.org/analysis/war-gaza-and-death-two-state-solution)
 of the Center for Strategic & International Studies discussed the potential difficulties that Gaza faces. Cordesman observed that

> “\[t\]he present levels of poverty and unemployment in Gaza have made popular support of Hamas and violence all too serious. Israel's future wartime and postwar security efforts will almost certainly make this situation far worse.”

If the same poverty and violence that preceded Hamas outlives their destruction, all that Israel will have gained is a name change for their enemy.

  

The destruction of Hamas needs to be paired with a political solution and meaningful international aid conditioned on Palestinian non-violence; guaranteeing Israel’s security and oversight to ensure honest and effective use of the aid will be necessities. This requires the wealthy Gulf states to seriously step forward, write large checks, and take responsibility for how the funds are used. The United States needs to play a large role, but without significant and continued support from Arab countries, it will not be seen as an honest broker by Palestinians.

  

Israel will need to stop, and even pull back, from new settlements in disputed land. They must also reaffirm their commitment to a two-state solution. Arab countries and Palestinian organizations must unconditionally affirm Israel’s right to exist. The use of slogans such as "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" must end, along with antisemitic acts and statements. Just as Israelis must accept that the majority of Gazans do not share their views of Hamas, Palestinians must acknowledge that just because their words can be spun not to have antisemitic overtones does not make it so.

  

All this may be just a pipe dream of an uniformed and naive westerner who the Palestinians would dismiss as just another Zionist and by the Israelis as a Jew that does not understand. I am a Zionist and a firm supporter of Israel. The Israel I love is a homeland for the Jewish people and a democracy. And I loathe the Netanyahu government's attempts to eviscerate democratic checks and balances. I take pride that Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East and that Arabs of various religious beliefs make up 20% of the Israeli population. I am proud that Arab citizens have equal civil rights, and there are currently 10 Arab members of the Knesset.

  

Sharon, Peres, and Rabin were correct that Israel needs peace and that "You don't make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies." The logic behind the 2005 decision for Israel to leave Gaza has more resonance today. Sharon, whom Palestinians blame for starting the Intifada when, as the leader of the Likud, he and his supports "[stormed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/28/palestinian-intifada-20-years-later-israeli-occupation-continues)
" [the Temple Mount](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/28/palestinian-intifada-20-years-later-israeli-occupation-continues)
 and who was vilified for allowing the massacre at the [Sabra and Shatila massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre)
 to occur, understood that math was not on Israel's side. When he decided to leave Gaza, he publicly recognized the impossibility of a continued occupation of an area with one million Muslims. He also lamented that Israel could not wait to act because '\[o\]ver 1 million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers with every generation." By 2020, the Gaza population exceeded 2 million.

  

![Population growth in Gaza](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_c2d43589d6214d2f9a1bbc635138cbf5~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_99,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_c2d43589d6214d2f9a1bbc635138cbf5~mv2.jpg)

Population growth in Gaza

Franklin's parable can become a reality with Hamas gone or critically weakened. Opportunity will exist. But so many other times, it has existed and been squandered. One need only remember the euphoria and promises made when Rabin and Arafat signed their agreement at the White House. If the present opportunity is squandered, Israel will have gained nothing but revenge for the horrendous acts of Hamas. Maybe for a few years, things will be peaceful. But, in the long run, it will only be a temporary respite.

  

The Confucian prophesy will become too real if the revenge cycle spins out of control. What most Israeli proponents ignore is that in Gaza, Hamas is not considered an outlaw terrorist organization. It came to power and displaced the Palestinian Authority not through violence but through the ballot box. Sharon, in 2005, recognized that Gazans

> "live in incredibly cramped refugee camps, in poverty and squalor, in hotbeds of ever-increasing hatred, with no hope whatsoever on the horizon."

The Palestinian Authority did almost nothing to improve their living conditions.

  

It was not Hamas' desire to destroy Israel that led to their electoral victory but the rejection of the corruption and ineptitude of the Palestinian Authority. Conditions in Gaza did not become bright once Hamas came to power. But, the Israeli economic and security restrictions gave Hamas a built-in excuse that Gazans are very willing to accept.

  

The current Israeli incursion, while justified, only makes things worse for Gazans. Smart bombs are not yet smart enough to only blow up the homes of those who support Hamas. When a power plant is destroyed, it affects all who the plant supplied power without regard to their political positions. In the same manner that the barbarity of the Hamas murder of Israelis galvanized Israel and produced an immediate and overwhelming response, the response of the Gazans to what they see as an unjustified killing of their friends and loved ones will not be any less intense.

  

A major difference is that Gazans lack the military capabilities of Israel. But what they do have is the terrorism of organizations like El-Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Abu-Nidal, and Black September. What these organizations have in common is that Israel destroyed them. Yet their demise did not end terrorist attacks on Israelis.

  

Palestinian terrorist organizations resemble the immortal phoenix, and no matter what Israel does, they cyclically regenerate or are otherwise born again. The only thing that will stop the cycle is to remove the birds' food source. In this case, it is the millions of Palestinians who believe, whether justified or not, that an unjust occupier controls their lives and those of their children. Sharon recognized that Gazans live "in hotbeds of ever-increasing hatred, with no hope whatsoever on the horizon." As long as these conditions do not change, nothing else will.

  

The hope that things will change and eventually get better is critical for any meaningful chance for peace. For Jews and Israel, the lessons of surviving the Final Solution is not only "Never Again." It is also that a key to survival in the death camps was hope. Nobel Laureate Ellie Weisel, a survivor of Auschwitz, found hope to be an essential ingredient.

> "Just as man cannot live without dreams, he cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future."

Nations also require hope to move forward and institute significant change. That must be a belief that change will create something better than what is in the present. Otherwise, why take the risks that change will bring? The status quo may be untenable, but at least it is a situation you are aware of.

Both sides have lived through periods of hope that ended with disappointment. Perhaps the greatest danger is that the October 7th terror attack and the Israeli reaction will be the last nail in hope's coffin. If that is so, then the second grave needs to be dug.

‘How can anyone be allowed to paint a swastika on the statue of Marianne, the goddess of French liberty, in the very center of the Place de la République?”

That was what the chairman of one of France’s most celebrated luxury brands was thinking last July, when a tall man in a black shirt and a kaffiyeh leapt to the ledge of Marianne’s pedestal and scrawled a black swastika. All around him, thousands of angry demonstrators were swarming the square with fake rockets, Palestinian and Hamas flags, even the black-and-white banners of ISIS. Here, barely a mile and a half from the Galeries Lafayette, the heart of bourgeois Paris, the chants: “MORT AUX JUIFS! MORT AUX JUIFS!” Death to the Jews. It was Saturday, July 26, 2014, and a pro-Palestinian demonstration turned into a day of terror in one of the most fashionable neighborhoods of the city.

“Do something! Do you see what is happening here?” the chairman said to a line of police officers watching the demonstration build to a frenzy. “What do you expect us to do?” one officer said, then looked away. For years, the chairman, a longtime anti-racism activist, has turned up at rallies like this one to see which politicians and which radical groups were present. (For reasons of personal safety, the chairman asked not to be identified for this story.) France’s endless demonstrations are a mainstay of the republic, a sacred right rooted in the legacy of Voltaire. But hate speech is a criminal offense—people may express their opinions, but not to the extent of insulting others based on their race, religion, or sex. The protest—against Israel’s Gaza policies—had been banned by the government, fearful of violence, following flare-ups in the preceding weeks. But if the police were to move in too quickly, the riots might continue all summer long—suburbs in flames, mobs in central Paris.

Photographs and videos of the swastika and its perpetrator, of protesters chanting “Kill the Jews,” and of the Palestinian, Hamas, and ISIS flags were sent in a rush to various groups in the Jewish community who assess threats. By early afternoon, some of these reached Sammy Ghozlan, a 72-year-old retired police commissioner who has spent his career working the _banlieues,_ the belt of working-class, racially mixed suburbs that surround Paris. Ghozlan is a folk hero of the _banlieues_ and has a nickname that is impossible to forget: _le poulet cacher_—“the kosher chicken.” (_Poulet_ is slang for cop.) For 15 years, he has overseen France’s National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism—known by its French abbreviation, B.N.V.C.A.—a community hotline he founded that is funded by his police pension and whatever small donations he can come by. Its purpose is nothing less than to protect the Jews of France.

    By Roberta Mercuri
    

This past year, Ghozlan’s frequent bulletins—detailing attacks in parks, schools attacked, synagogues torched, assaults on the Métro—have clogged the in-boxes of reporters at _Le Monde, Le Figaro,_ and _Le Parisien,_ and of thousands of Jews throughout the _banlieues._ Ghozlan’s bulletins sometimes come twice a day, with claims that have also been backed up by hard numbers: according to a watchdog group, the Jewish Community Protection Service, or S.P.C.J., which reports statistics collected by the country’s Interior Ministry, there were 851 recorded anti-Semitic incidents in France in 2014, more than doubling the total from 2013. Ghozlan and his 19 volunteers are on the front lines in the most troubled areas, documenting, trying to confirm, hoping to get a reporter or a police prefect or a court to take action. There has been such an uptick, and such a flurry of alerts from Ghozlan over the past year, that there’s always a risk that his efforts will be shrugged off as yet another nuisance.

Just two weeks before the July 26 riot, Ghozlan’s texts and messages did not stop. It was Bastille Day weekend, and, on Sunday, July 13, he tracked the hundreds of protesters who rushed into the Marais, Paris’s historic Jewish quarter, stopping briefly at an empty synagogue on the Rue des Tournelles, near the Place des Vosges, and then racing, reportedly with iron bars, axes, and flags, toward the Rue de la Roquette, a boutique-and-café-lined street a few blocks from the apartment of Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Their destination was the Don Isaac Abravanel synagogue. Inside, the 200 worshippers—including the chief rabbi of Paris—heard the howls from the crowd, estimated to number about 300: “Hitler was right!” “Jews, get out of France!” Audrey Zenouda, a policewoman who happened to be inside the synagogue, called her father, a retired policeman who works with Ghozlan at the B.N.V.C.A. “Do something. We are terrified here.”

“I knew that if anyone could get the police to take action it would be Sammy and the B.N.V.C.A.,” Zenouda later told me. Only six police officers were assigned to be on demonstration duty that day. “We are waiting for the assault police to arrive,” one told a reporter at the scene. After an hour, a counterterrorism force rescued the chief rabbi, but everyone else was left inside, behind doors barricaded from the inside with chairs and tables. Outside, members of a special security patrol and a dozen members of the self-trained Ligue de Défense Juive began chasing off the demonstrators with chairs and tables from nearby cafés, working with a small unit from the security force. Together, it took them three hours to disperse the crowd and safely evacuate the synagogue.

Almost immediately afterward, the reports of the July 13 demonstration would be challenged and debated. The numbers would be skeptically parsed—were there really so many?—and questions would be asked about actions that might have provoked the violence, as if carrying iron bars and axes around central Paris might be normal. In some circles, there were even accusations that the Jews “brought on the behavior,” as they always do.

In the crowd—and many others that would turn the summer of 2014 into a summer of hate in Paris—were representatives of France’s political parties, both left and right. France’s Muslim population is estimated to be around 5 million, a potential voting bloc in a country of 66 million. (The Jewish population of France is in the neighborhood of 500,000.) Shimon Samuels, the director for international relations at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Paris—which combats anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and extremism, and, through a foundation, helps to fund Ghozlan’s hotline—witnessed some of the events of July 13. Among those he recognized in the crowd were a local concierge and bank teller, along with members of the current Socialist government.

Monitoring the footage later, Ghozlan was sickened to see the faces of political allies he had worked with for decades, mostly in what is known as Le Neuf Trois (“9–3”), the area of northern Paris suburbs that he once presided over as a commissioner of police. Le Neuf Trois is the rap name for this district, which has the honor of being, by reputation anyway, the most violent in France. (The name derives from the area’s postal codes, which all begin with “93.”) It is also where Ghozlan lived for 30 years in a spacious house surrounded by hedges on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in the relatively calm community of Le Blanc-Mesnil.

For Ghozlan, July 2014 was the tipping point, after years of escalating anti-Semitic violence: “There was no debate in our family. We all knew—it is time to go. Leaving is better than running away,” Ghozlan later told me. He would ultimately come to think of the summer riots as the predictors of the catastrophes that would play out six months later in the terror attacks at the offices of the satirical weekly _Charlie Hebdo,_ three quarters of a mile from the Place de la République, on January 7, 2015, and then, two days later, at Hyper Cacher, a kosher grocery store in the Porte de Vincennes neighborhood of eastern Paris.

By then Ghozlan’s classified ad—one nobody who knows him could ever have thought possible—had already been posted: “Renting a house, 4 rooms, 2 bathrooms, a veranda, a garden with 50 m. square.” Two days before the _Charlie Hebdo_ attack, Sammy announced what, to many, including me, was unthinkable: Sammy Ghozlan, proud Frenchman and the dean of Paris’s anti-Semitic crime-fighters, had joined the thousands of French Jews moving to Israel.

**The Sephardic Columbo**
-------------------------

More than a decade ago, I spent weeks with Ghozlan at the height of the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began in September of 2000 and lasted more than four years. Ghozlan had recently started the B.N.V.C.A. hotline and was working from a crammed back room in a synagogue in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais. When I first met him, in the fall of 2002, Ghozlan carried a white plastic binder bulging with one-page reports written up from the calls he’d received from tipsters. All day and all night his phone would ring. It never left his hand. More than 300 reports were in that binder: Molotov cocktails thrown at Jewish schools, students called _sale Juif_ (“dirty Jew”), arsons, desecrations, a Jewish woman beaten in a taxi. The attacks on the Jews of France had yet to catch the attention of the international press, and Ghozlan could get almost no one in Paris to take him seriously.

Now, 12 years later, Ghozlan’s binder is one of 50 that fill the shelves of his office in central Paris. I went to see him again last spring, when he was back in the city, having undergone surgery to repair a tendon in his leg. The B.N.V.C.A. was still operating, with Ghozlan monitoring from Netanya, a seaside town near Tel Aviv, where as many as 2,000 French Jews immigrated to in 2014, and where Ghozlan moved last December, coming back to Paris every six weeks or so.

The base of the Statue de la République is defaced with a swastika as a protest in support of Palestinians turns anti-Semitic, Paris, July 26, 2014. By Etienne Laurent/EPA/Corbis.

Ghozlan resembles a beat-up version of Yves Montand, and the decade since we had seen each other only heightened the effect. Otherwise, not much had changed. He still wears the neat blazer and open shirt that suggest his native North Africa. (He was born in Algeria.) And he was still constantly on the phone, issuing directives to investigate allegations of anti-Semitism. He dispatched volunteer lawyers to the courts to try to stop marauding anti-Israel protesters who stripped kosher and Israeli products from supermarket shelves. And he was entrenched in a longtime legal battle against the anti-Semitic, Holocaust-denying comedian Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, who was recently convicted in Paris of condoning terrorism. “This case obsesses me,” Ghozlan told me. “I have been filing against him for 10 years.” On his iPhone, he shows me dozens of pictures of Dieudonné’s fans in front of the Hyper Cacher, after the bloody hostage crisis of January 9, making the sign of the “_quenelle,_” a Nazi-style salute that Dieudonné created and popularized.

It had been two months since that attack, and Ghozlan was fixated on trying to make sense of what had happened inside the Hyper Cacher, where a 32-year-old terrorist named Amedy Coulibaly, who had grown up in a Paris suburb with his Malian parents, massacred four people in a quiet area of bobos and professionals in Porte de Vincennes. He wore a GoPro video camera strapped to his torso to record the slaughter. He reportedly announced to his hostages: “I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State.” By the time the siege was over, four French Jews were dead, including one young man who grabbed a gun that Coulibaly had left on a counter because it had jammed. The day before, Coulibaly had killed a policewoman who was investigating a traffic accident in the suburb of Montrouge.

When news flashed of the Montrouge shooting, Ghozlan was following the situation from Netanya. He had an instinct and contacted a close friend in another Jewish organization who lived nearby. “This morning attack in Montrouge,” he wrote. “Can you check to see if this was near the \[Jewish\] school?” The answer came: “You are right. The school is close. There are rumors, but you are wrong. We are there and the school is not the target.” Later reports indicated that a Jewish school in Montrouge may actually have been Coulibaly’s original target. In Netanya, Ghozlan had yet to unpack his furniture, but he was already making plans to get back to Paris.

Moving back permanently was out of the question, but it hasn’t been easy for Ghozlan to disconnect. “I am deeply French,” he told me. “I did my military service in the air force. I love France’s values, its culture, its history, its cuisine, philosophers, and artists. I never imagined that I would someday leave. I led the fight for 15 years and all our warnings made no difference.” In 2014, about 7,000 Jews left France for Israel, and this year the anticipated exodus is between 10,000 and 15,000. The Jewish Agency for Israel recently reported that, in 2014, 50,000 French Jews made inquiries about moving to Israel, an astonishing number. In many of France’s public lycées, Jewish students are insulted, classrooms are vandalized, books are defaced, and fights break out in the classroom with any attempt to teach the Holocaust. After the _Charlie Hebdo_ and Hyper Cacher attacks, there were reports that classes were disrupted when some Muslim students refused to participate in any memorial for the victims. According to Shimon Samuels, about 40 percent of France’s Jewish students are now in Jewish schools and 35 percent in Catholic schools. “This is an unprecedented situation,” Ghozlan tells me. “We are in new territory here.”

Ghozlan’s phone rings. When he hangs up, he tells me of two unidentified Muslim men who have swept into a Jewish school in Paris’s well-heeled 16th Arrondissement. (Earlier that week, there had been an incident at another Jewish school, in the 11th Arrondissement, an area of professionals, politicians, and writers.) “How did these thugs get into the school?” Ghozlan asks. “They walked around as if they were staking it out.” The school in the 16th was evacuated and the bomb squad deployed. None of this will appear in the press, Ghozlan says. There is a fear in the schools that they will lose more students.

Ghozlan’s voice is the first thing that commands attention—his inflection is almost musical. A part of Ghozlan’s celebrity in the _banlieues_ is his reputation as a former bandleader who played three instruments and oversaw orchestras that worked the Jewish-wedding and Bar Mitzvah circuit in Paris, advertising “Groove, Funck, Hassidiques, Israélien … Oriental.” He learned his limited English by lip-synching to Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive.”

Like 70 percent of France’s Jewish population, Ghozlan is Sephardic, part of the group from North Africa called _pieds-noirs_ (“black feet”). He lived in the Algerian city of Constantine until 1962, when, at age 20, he fled the country with his family in the wake of the Algerian war, taking with him just “a sandwich and a suitcase,” a commonly used _pied-noir_ expression. With his wife, Monique, a petite kindergarten teacher he met when they were both in a Jewish youth group in Algeria, he lived in the house in Le Blanc-Mesnil. There were bedrooms for his three daughters and one son, and his mother, who never missed an episode of _NYPD Blue._ When I first met Ghozlan, he struck me as a Sephardic Columbo. Early in his police career, he managed to negotiate order in a part of the _banlieues_ that was so violent it was nicknamed Chicago. His method was to offer judo classes to the immigrant populations—many of which spoke Arabic, as Ghozlan does. He was assigned to take care of juvenile offenders, who seemed to respond to his direct style and lack of hyperbole, which he had learned, he told me, from his father, a former chief of detectives in Constantine.

Ghozlan made his counterterrorism reputation when the synagogue on the Rue Copernic was bombed in 1980, an attack that killed 4 people and injured more than 40. Ghozlan learned that the perpetrators were Palestinian sympathizers, not the neo-Nazis the police first suspected. He was made special commissioner to investigate the next major anti-Semitic attack, on Chez Jo Goldenberg, a landmark Jewish restaurant in the Marais, where 6 people, including two Americans, were killed, and another 22 wounded, in 1982. Ghozlan’s police career—always running alongside his Bar Mitzvah shows—eventually brought him to head the department in Aulnay-sous-Bois, in Seine-Saint-Denis. He retired in 1998 and in 2000 started the B.N.V.C.A., finding himself almost alone in his fight to protect the Jews of the _banlieues._

Ghozlan has been awarded the Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest tribute. But his urgency has always made him an outlier, an annoyance to the assimilation-conscious, largely secular Jewish establishment concentrated in Paris’s preferred arrondissements, who still view him as a publicity hound from the _banlieues,_ a Jew who does not know when not to react. However noble Ghozlan’s motives, he makes a nuisance of himself with his incessant press releases, I was told a decade ago. That sentiment hasn’t changed in some quarters.

When I originally met Ghozlan, he railed that his jerry-rigged detective agency had to deal with a rigid French justice system. To register a hate crime in France—which comes with a higher level of punishment than an ordinary crime—he would have to appear in front of a magistrate, who was generally loath to call the beating of a rabbi in the Métro an act of anti-Semitism. For them, Ghozlan said, it was a “simple assault,” usually committed by an unemployed French Muslim acting out of frustration. This enraged Ghozlan. “I wanted to start a Jewish defense force,” Ghozlan told me. Judge after judge told him, “There is no anti-Semitism charge applicable unless someone dies.” The party line of the Establishment Jewish organizations in Paris was always “Sammy, stop rocking the boat.” Back then, even David de Rothschild, the banker, told _The\*\*Jerusalem Post_ that the wave of attacks was likely coming from “neo-Nazis, a hostile, aggressive, antisemitic, right-wing population … ” He soon changed his mind.

**Foreigners Again**
--------------------

Twelve years later. It feels like an eye-of-the-storm moment in Paris, as the government of François Hollande tries to restore calm after last summer’s riots and the January terror attacks, amid a faltering economy and plunging euro. When I landed, in March, the rise of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the right-wing National Front, was in the headlines, as Paris was still struggling to recover from the terrorist attacks of January. Mounds of flowers and posters could be seen on the streets. There were swirls of tourists at the Louvre, as always, but there were more soldiers with automatic weapons at every Jewish school and institution, even in the dining room of a Rothschild-foundation nursing home. In the lobby of the synagogue on Rue Copernic—the one damaged by the bomb in 1980—schoolchildren walked in proximity to machine guns. The optics were unnerving.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls—taking the risk that he might antagonize his Socialist Party base, which leans pro-Palestinian—was issuing a series of muscular statements seeking to stop the flood of Jews leaving France. Among them: anti-Zionism is “an invitation to anti-Semitism.” An increase in prejudice is “growing in an insufferable manner in our country,” he said, and pledged 100 million euros toward combating “racism and anti-Semitism.” Ten thousand soldiers were deployed throughout the country. Parts of the _banlieues_ have resembled war zones, including, at times, Créteil, east of Paris, where Valls made his pledge. Last December, Créteil endured the brutal case of a 19-year-old woman whose apartment, which she shared with her boyfriend, was broken into. One of her assailants allegedly said, “You must have cash here because you are Jews.” They then gang-raped her. In April, Valls announced that French police had foiled five terrorist attacks in recent months amid stepped-up security. One involved an Algerian who allegedly shot himself by accident and then called an ambulance. “The threat has never been so high,” Valls said. “We have never had to face this kind of terrorism in our history.” (In June, the Anti-Defamation League was preparing to release a survey suggesting that the French population has become increasingly aware of the problem of anti-Semitism.)

More than a million people rally to honor those killed in the _Charlie Hebdo_ and Hyper Cacher terrorist attacks, Place de la République, Paris, January 11, 2015. By Nicolas Gouhier/Abaca Press/SIPA USA.

The former foreign minister, 92-year-old Roland Dumas, once convicted of accepting illegal gifts from a mistress who was a lobbyist for a French oil giant—the conviction was later reversed—criticized Valls, even though they are both in the Socialist Party. “He has personal alliances. That means he has prejudices. Everyone knows he is married to someone … who has influence on him,” Dumas said on a news show. Valls’s wife is the Jewish violinist Anne Gravoin. Immediately, the Wiesenthal center called on President Hollande to strip Dumas of his Légion d’Honneur, as the British designer John Galliano had been when he lashed out against the Jews. Its campaign was unsuccessful.

France has the largest population of Jews in Europe (and the third largest in the world, after Israel and the United States) and has always been seen as the laboratory to understand what is happening on the Continent. But Jews make up less than 1 percent of the French population. Even so, according to the S.P.C.J., they are the target of 51 percent of all racist acts in France. The country has become Israel’s biggest source of immigrants.

There are those who question the dire statistics. “Can you believe that a philanthropist from New York was here last week and told us he had come to offer us humanitarian aid?” said Sacha Reingewirtz, the president of the Union of French Jewish Students, which won a court case against Twitter in 2013, forcing Twitter to identify authors of anti-Semitic tweets in France. Reingewirtz, with degrees from Oxford and the Sorbonne, tries to minimize the fact that swastikas have appeared on university campuses. The Jews of the Paris establishment have long lived a form of double life; religion in France is traditionally a private matter. “There is still a sense of downplay among the upper middle class,” said the author Clémence Boulouque, a former literary critic for _Le Figaro_ who now lives in New York. “There is a sense of pride. There is a reluctance to share our feelings and fears.”

It’s precisely this attitude that Ghozlan has been battling for decades, one that is fiercely resilient given the current mood in Paris. The country’s counterterrorism forces are now desperately trying to cope with what is commonly called the “third wave of anti-Semitism” in modern France. The first wave, coming from the far right, morphed into the neo-Nazi crusades of the 1990s, which targeted not only France’s Jews but also the growing Muslim population isolated in projects on the outskirts of the cities. The second wave came from the far left—rooted in pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel attitudes—and erupted during the first and second intifadas, with flare-ups in the 1990s and early 2000s. The third wave has been propelled by the recent rise of ISIS, has metastasized via thousands of Web sites and social media, and, in France, has become homegrown and home-schooled among a vulnerable population of young Muslims. One Jewish-American expat, living with his young family in a quiet part of Le Neuf Trois, just over the Boulevard Périphérique from Montmartre, told me, “It can feel like there are two choices for a young man in the projects: sell drugs or turn to Islam.”

French Muslims who are as assimilated as French Jews speak privately of suddenly being trapped into the identity of Islam, whether they are religious or not. Sartre once wrote of the Jews, “It is the anti-Semite who creates the Jew.” The same can be said about Muslims, as the documentary-film maker and novelist Karim Miské—who was born in Ivory Coast and was not brought up Muslim—wrote in _Le Monde:_ “It is the Islamophobe who makes the Muslim.” Recently, Miské, winner of an English PEN award for his novel _Arab Jazz,_ set in the checkerboard world of the 19th Arrondissement, was in the Marais with his 12-year-old daughter when a well-dressed man looked at him menacingly and said, “Boom.” “The tragedy is that we are now trapped in an identification with religion,” he told me. “Frankly, it is racist.”

I went to visit a Jewish family in the Sixth Arrondissement, where life is as assimilated and as privileged as it gets for Jews in Paris. The 18-year-old daughter, a high-school senior making plans to attend university in England, asked me, “Is it true that if I lived in America I could wear a tiny Star of David necklace or a sweatshirt from Technion university?”

“What would happen if you wore it in this neighborhood?” I asked. “Do you think you would be physically attacked?”

“I would be made to feel _angoisse,_” she said, meaning uncomfortable, filled with anxiety or angst. This teenager was certain there would be looks and harassment, perhaps even a physical altercation. I heard the word _angoisse_ frequently in Paris. However established you have been as a Jew in France, I was told, you no longer have the luxury of feeling invisible. It is as if the Jews of France are being forced yet again into a ghetto of cultural identification. This, despite France’s profound traditions of liberty, equality, and fraternity, not to mention _laïcité_—the stubborn commitment to strict secularism. As a member of an established Jewish family recently told the _Telegraph_ columnist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, “When did we become foreigners again?”

**“No One Else Will Die”**
--------------------------

On the ninth of January, the day of the Hyper Cacher attack in Porte de Vincennes, the sirens of Paris did not stop. Ghozlan’s niece, a lawyer, was on her way to the Hyper Cacher when she ran into a friend just outside the store. It was one P.M. They stopped to talk. Suddenly, a muscular African rushed past her with his knapsack. He knocked her in the shoulder. A few moments later she heard gunshots. She called her uncle immediately. Ghozlan happened to know the store owner. He texted him and started calling everyone he knew in the Paris police.

Only 12 days before, on December 28, Ghozlan had had an ominous feeling and sent out another of his warnings: “The next attack is going to come at an unguarded Jewish business or store. The B.N.V.C.A. demands 24/7 security on Jewish stores.” An associate told him, “You are going too far, Sammy.”

In news reports of the Hyper Cacher attack, one man is called the Unidentified Hostage. I met him in Paris in March, several weeks before French judges placed a gag order on the hostages. His story has never been told publicly. In the five hours that Coulibaly held 19 people hostage, André, as he insists on being called, was the only one alone with the attacker for long stretches of time. When he was finally rescued with the other surviving hostages, he spent hours briefing the counterterrorism squad, was congratulated for his sangfroid, drafted a 10-page statement, and met Prime Minister Valls at a reception. Soon after, André took leave from work, afraid for his life.

André is 43, a computer tech with clients that include law firms and banks. He is Jewish, but non-observant, and does not keep kosher. He had heard of Sammy Ghozlan but never paid particular attention to the B.N.V.C.A. Like everyone in Paris, he was badly shaken by the terrorist attack at the offices of _Charlie Hebdo,_ and on Friday, January 9, he and his girlfriend made the decision to stay in for the weekend. The Hyper Cacher is known for its appetizers—tabbouleh, hummus, freshly prepared every day. Moments after they entered the shop to buy some snacks for the weekend, they heard gunshots and raced downstairs to the basement with others to hide. A few minutes later, a fellow customer rushed down and told them, “He will kill us all if you do not come up.” André and his girlfriend followed a group upstairs to a scene of bodies, blood pooling on the floor, and an angry Coulibaly: “Does anyone here know anything about computers?”

For André, the smooth-faced African was obviously “a boy of the _banlieues._” He was struck by what seemed to be a split in Coulibaly’s personality. He seemed equal parts insecure student and newly trained terrorist, as if he were taking cues from the ISIS playbook, which inspires working-class would-be jihadists to morph into monsters capable of beheading. “It is a form of empowerment,” André said. It became clear to André that, for all his training, Coulibaly did not possess the tech skills needed to perform what was evidently an essential task: the uploading of his GoPro footage of the carnage, in which four people were slaughtered in the first moments of the attack. “He needed it for instant replay on jihadi sites,” André said. Just as urgently, Coulibaly wanted to get online to monitor the news. “What was urgent is that his footage was expected to be uploaded while he was in the store to incite other attacks in Paris.”

Coulibaly had raced into the store with at least one Kalashnikov rifle, a Scorpion submachine gun, two Tokarev pistols, knives, ammunition, and a silver laptop, with instructions on how to upload his footage and what to say to the news media. What he did not bring, however, was any equipment to make it work without Wi-Fi. The Hyper Cacher had no Wi-Fi. In addition, Coulibaly forgot to bring his charger cord, and his laptop was running out of power. In the office of the small store, his frustration was mounting. “He was desperate to get online,” André said. André volunteered to help. For the next five hours, he was in and out of the office of the Hyper Cacher as Coulibaly ricocheted between rage and calm. At one point, Coulibaly questioned the hostages and learned that André had never been inside the Hyper Cacher before. “Wow, that is bad luck,” Coulibaly said.

André is a slight man, with delicate hands and large expressive eyes. It was easy to understand how Coulibaly would not have found him threatening. His size, however, masked his physical strength and discipline. On the day we met, he wore purple suede running shoes and a gray silk scarf knotted around his neck. His first task was to get Coulibaly online. “Are you sure you know what you are doing?” Coulibaly said, and hovered over him with the guns. “I just focused,” André said. “I told him what I was doing as I was doing it. And at all times I called him ‘mister,’ and I used the formal _vous,_ as a way of showing my respect. I wanted to keep him calm. I knew that already he had killed four people, and I made it my mission: No one else will die. ‘We don’t need Wi-Fi,’ I told him. ‘I can get you online.’ ” André grabbed a cable from the Hyper Cacher’s printer, used it to connect Coulibaly’s laptop to the store’s Internet hookup, and opened a Web browser on Coulibaly’s desktop. He could have used an application that would have left no footprint—like Tails, the choice of Edward Snowden—but a browser, André knew, is easily trackable.

Soon, the news was up on the three channels Coulibaly had requested, France 24, Canal+, and BFMTV, the country’s leading news network, which Coulibaly was determined to contact. André remained near him. “Connect me to the newsdesk,” Coulibaly snapped, but he kept his laptop angled so André could not see directly onto the screen. What he did manage to see was a complex set of instructions that Coulibaly had downloaded and was trying to follow. On the telephone finally with BFMTV, Coulibaly began to free-associate a rambling statement about his mission to avenge the Prophet and kill the Jews. When he hung up, he continued to speak to André, and, from time to time, others in the store. He allowed the hostages to have lunch. “I will serve you,” André said, which angered Coulibaly. “I have not given you that order,” Coulibaly said.

Some of what Coulibaly talked about that day was tracked by authorities when they were able to monitor a Samsung Galaxy phone Coulibaly had borrowed from one customer, but much was not. To André, he admitted that he had killed the policewoman in Montrouge and that he was working with Cherif and Said Kouachi, the brothers responsible for the _Charlie Hebdo_ massacre. “He said, ‘There are many people like me who are now preparing in Arab countries.’ He told me, and others too, ‘I am not crazy. We understand the Koran. We understand the good and the right way.’ ” Coulibaly’s French sounded unsophisticated to André, without subjunctives. On the telephone, however, with French media, he spoke a more academic French, as if he had been tutored with a formal script.

What André never revealed to Coulibaly was that, in his early career, he had, in fact, been a teacher in a very tough suburb. “It was a different France then,” he told me. “In the 1990s we had no problems. I had students that reminded me of Coulibaly. They were operating out of the system. We were trained in how to work with them.” The first step, he said, was to always show them respect. “I knew to listen and not to argue. I knew, ‘Do not use the familiar _tu_—that only came at the end.’ I used the word _vous_ until he began saying ‘_tu_’ to me.”

André did not tell Coulibaly another essential fact of his life. On the roster of his tech clients were some with high security clearances at foreign embassies. From a cold-storage room in the basement of the Hyper Cacher, he had texted his contacts. The French counterterrorism squad still has his phone, he said, but André re-created a version of what he sent: “It is very urgent. There is a terrorist attack at Hyper Cacher. He has already killed.” He noticed that he had only two bars on his own Samsung Galaxy and worried that it would not go through. He quickly sent another: “I am downstairs in the refrigerator room.” And one more: “I am in the Hyper Cacher of Porte de Vincennes. There is someone with a weapon and he has already killed.”

Several times that afternoon, Coulibaly, finally calm, asked André, “Do you understand why I am doing what I am doing? Do you understand what I am doing here? I am here because the Prophet has given me an order. I am here to stop the war in the Arab countries.”

“I said, ‘I can understand what you are saying.’ I went into a neutral state, like a teacher. I wanted him to see into my eyes and know that I was not angry. I said, ‘I am here and I will try to help you.’ ” He was, André believed, hoping for a glimmer of mutually understood truth or to hear perhaps the ultimate French compliment of agreement: _exactement!_

Reliving it, André starts to tremble slightly. He has been in therapy since January, as has his girlfriend, who still cannot get on the Métro. His fear is that he will be identified, and his life will be threatened. “Again and again he said, ‘This is not my fault. I have to do this. It is not against you personally.’ He wanted me to acknowledge in some way his point of view. And what had brought him to what he had to do. He needed to be understood.”

**Au Revoir, Paris**

The most troubling question in the French Jewish community is also the most obvious one: “Is it time to leave?”

I asked Roger Cukierman, the head of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France, or CRIF, the umbrella group for secular Jewish organizations in France. I expected him to equivocate, but, by way of an answer, he quickly reeled off some of the horrors that have plagued the Jews of Europe during the last decade: the case of Ilan Halimi, a cell-phone salesman kidnapped, brutally tortured, and killed in the Paris suburbs by a gang in 2006 for being Jewish; the 2012 murders of three small children and one adult at point-blank range at the Ozar Hatorah school, in Toulouse, by Mohamed Merah; the 2014 slaughter at the Brussels Jewish Museum; the deadly attack at the synagogue in Copenhagen in February of this year. This March, Merah’s stepbrother was pictured in the _New York Post_ in his camouflage ISIS togs pronouncing a death sentence, as a pre-pubescent boy beside him pulled the trigger in the videotaped execution of the 19-year-old Israeli Arab Muhamed Musalam. Then there are the riots. As Cukierman told _The Telegraph_ last summer, “They are not screaming ‘Death to the Israelis’ on the streets of Paris. They are screaming ‘Death to the Jews.’ ”

To get a better idea of why Ghozlan decided to leave, I went to visit his friend and colleague Yossi Malka, a retired businessman who works for the B.N.V.C.A. Malka met me at the commuter rail station at Stains, a suburb in Le Neuf Trois. If you didn’t know better, you could be in parts of Queens or the Bronx. Here are the same gray projects, laundry flung over the balconies.

Malka wore a worn brown leather jacket, a natty tie, and a fedora—what I think of as the uniform of the _banlieues_—and drove me to Sarcelles, 20 minutes away and part of what is called the Red Belt, a string of suburban towns, many with Communist or Socialist mayors historically but, now, an expanding National Front. “This is not the Paris of Woody Allen,” Malka told me as we approached a small synagogue ringed by low apartment buildings topped with satellite dishes. “That Paris no longer exists.”

Sarcelles, which borders Le Neuf Trois, is an extended area of small apartment houses, shopping centers, projects, and markets, the first stop for middle-class Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians, who, like Ghozlan’s family, immigrated to France in the 1960s. For decades these neighborhoods were peaceful, a vibrant mix of French citizens and immigrants, all trying to make their way in a country with little regard for their special identities.

“Welcome to the most endangered synagogue in France,” Malka said as we entered a small driveway in Garges-lès-Gonesse, a suburb next to Sarcelles. “Look at that,” he said, pointing out through the windshield. “All day, they throw things—melons, garbage, rocks, and bottles.” Parked in front was a large silver van from France’s counterterrorism force, Vigipirate.

In Garges last July, a week after the violence on the Rue de la Roquette, a highly visible billboard advertising lollipops was modified with a large scrawl: PALESTINE WILL LIVE, PALESTINE WILL OVERCOME. COME WITH: MORTAR, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, BATON. DEMONSTRATION AT THE GARGES-SARCELLES TRAIN STATION. COME OUT IN NUMBERS! FOLLOW TO THE JEWISH QUARTER.

French authorities took action, and the pro-Palestinian demonstrations planned for the weekend, which clearly promised another wave of anti-Semitic violence, were forbidden. Yet nothing was done to stop them. On Saturday, July 19, thousands appeared in and around Paris, burning cars, attacking buses. By two P.M. the next day, a mob of hundreds crowded the narrow street by the Garges synagogue, and the first rocks had shattered the Star of David window. Hammers were taken to the lock at the gate; the marks were still visible when I visited in March. The police refused to move in. Ghozlan was alerted immediately but could hardly hear over what had become the standard rallying cry: “MORT AUX JUIFS!” Their next destination: the shopping center in Sarcelles and its large synagogue, two blocks away, another stop on Malka’s grim tour.

Ghozlan sent out a blast via text message: “Big emergency in Sarcelles. Stores are being attacked. Synagogue is being held by demonstrators. Police are not going in Sarcelles.” Within the hour, a pharmacy was in flames. Then hundreds raced through the central plaza toward a Jewish market and that too went up in flames. Then on to the synagogue. Ghozlan was furiously texting for every member of the Ligue de Défense Juive in the area to get to the synagogue and protect it, while advising the general public to “stay out of Sarcelles.”

News footage showed French police standing inert for almost two hours until reinforcements arrived with tear gas. (The previous day, the police had used tear gas and made 38 arrests.) With the help of the Ligue, they were able to push back the mob. Later, they would say they were waiting for authorization: France’s police are under strict instructions not to intervene without actual threats of violence. When the young people of the synagogue came outside, they began to sing “La Marseillaise” to thank the police for their rescue. Standing in the crowd, Malka saw several French police officers crying. “This should not be happening ever again in France,” one of them told Malka. Earlier that afternoon, Prime Minister Valls had laid a wreath during a commemoration of the 72nd anniversary of the roundup that sent more than 13,000 Jews from Paris to the Nazi death camps.

When I asked Ghozlan about this day, his eyes moistened. “I relived my childhood. In Algeria, the French said they would protect us. Then the mobs came and torched Jewish businesses and we had to flee.”

The first things Ghozlan packed last November were his musical instruments, two violins and a piano. Then he sorted through hundreds of family photographs and letters. He shipped a Louis XVI commode and a writing desk but left most of the furniture for the tenants, an immigrant family who were the first to answer the ad for the house on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in Le Blanc-Mesnil that Ghozlan had built in the 1970s. Today, few of the Ghozlans’ Jewish neighbors remain; two-thirds of the members of his synagogue down the street have departed. His three daughters have already moved to Israel.

Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, in a still from a video he recorded before the Hyper Cacher attack. From Polaris.

What surprised many was Ghozlan’s determination to leave. He resisted encouragement from a friend and neighbor, Hassen Chalghoumi, the imam of Drancy, who moved to that suburban town, the next one over from Le Blanc-Mesnil, from Tunisia in 1996. He has been an ally of Ghozlan’s for most of the past decade, attending his rollicking Shabbat dinners and hosting Ghozlan for lunches at his mosque. “I told him again and again, ‘You cannot leave,’ ” Chalghoumi told me. “Sammy would not engage in the conversation.”

Chalghoumi is tall and commanding, with an exuberant personality. “The world changed on 9/11,” he said. “At the airport I am often pulled out of the lines.” But the imam reacted strongly when I referred to “Islamophobia.” “I will not use that word,” he said. “That plays into a sense of victimization.”

Chalghoumi gave a speech at the Shoah Memorial in Drancy in 2006. Not long after, his house was vandalized, the contents damaged or destroyed. At a prayer service in 2009, Chalghoumi talked about the need to respect the Jews and their centuries of culture. The next day, around 200 protesters collected outside his mosque, confronting anyone who tried to enter. Many of the protesters waved signs: PUPPET OF THE JEWS. With members of a Jewish organization, he toured Israel with 20 imams in 2012. When he returned, there was a mass of demonstrators at the airport. In 2013, he was in Tunisia with his family when he was assaulted near a mosque. His daughters were with him and have yet to get over it. He spent days in the hospital.

I met Chalghoumi in a private room at a Hilton, given to him, he said, by “Jewish friends”—the hotel owners. With him were three bodyguards. His next appointment was with the grand rabbi of Brussels, and soon, Chalghoumi said, he would be on his way back to Israel. His phone rings as frequently as Ghozlan’s. One of the calls that day was from someone informing the imam that the French government would start shutting down a few Islamist Web sites that were advocating terrorism. “Bravo,” he said. “It’s a start.”

He pulled out his iPhone and showed me dozens of racist sites, many naming him as a target. Suddenly, I heard shouts from the speaker. The images on the screen were of demonstrators massed against him in Drancy. The problem in France, Chalghoumi believes, “is the foreign funding of mosques where imams are often imported from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Why won’t the government put a stop to it? No one is monitoring what is going on. All of the imams here should be trained in France.”

When Ghozlan was in the hospital, Chalghoumi made sure to visit—the only one of his friends, Ghozlan later told me, who made the effort. The imam thinks he might still have a shot at getting his friend to move back to Paris. “I am not giving up,” he told me. “I am going to make him change his mind.”

Throughout the second half of 2014, Ghozlan and the B.N.V.C.A. were in overdrive amid a flurry of new reports: signs in Le Neuf Trois that said, HITLER WAS RIGHT; a 16-year-old Jewish student hospitalized when four Africans jumped him; groups making Nazi salutes at the Shoah Memorial; the robbery and rape in Créteil. A new white plastic binder had to be started.

On Christmas Day, Ghozlan received word that an air rifle had been fired at a kosher fast-food restaurant in the 19th Arrondissement, just a few days after a synagogue had been similarly attacked. Then, the following day, a nearby synagogue and a printer’s shop. Ghozlan insisted on cranking out a press release. Then he sent out the alert predicting further attacks on Jewish stores, 12 days before Coulibaly entered the Hyper Cacher.

On that January day, the chairman of the luxury-goods company who witnessed the defacing of Marianne with a swastika last July got a hysterical phone call from his daughter. She had learned on Facebook that one of her father’s cousins was trapped inside the store. Her father was already in a garage off the Champs-Élysées, getting on his motorcycle to try to get through the police lines in Porte de Vincennes.

Inside the office of the Hyper Cacher, Coulibaly was desperate to connect to the police. He demanded that André dial the number. Coulibaly heard the recording: “ ‘If you need this office, press 1. If you need that office, press 2,’ ” André told me. “Coulibaly said, ‘What bullshit. Nothing in this country works.’ ” He had managed to get through to French TV but was still having other problems. He needed to upload his GoPro footage, but, André said, “his program was a very old Adobe Flash Player. Maybe if the Flash Player would have been working, I would never have been in that office all that time. At one point, he asked all of us our names and religion. And what we did for a living. I said, ‘I am a handyman. That is how I know computers.’ At that moment, he took his weapon and started to load it. I thought, This is the end.”

In the Hyper Cacher office later that afternoon, André saw that Coulibaly’s upload of his seven minutes of carnage had stalled at 87 percent. Then he heard noises coming from outside. He and his girlfriend hid under the checkout counter. Coulibaly had gone to a corner of the store to pray. When the counterterrorism squad sprayed bullets into the store, Coulibaly was killed instantly. As André and the other hostages, including the luxury-company chairman’s cousin, rushed out, they were told, “Do not look to your side.” In the pandemonium, André did not notice Coulibaly’s dead body next to the checkout counter.

Nicolas Comte, the head of the Unité SGP police union, had been among the crowd earlier in the day outside the Hyper Cacher. Tall and broadly built, he resembles a TV anchor and is the face of the French police. When we spoke, he mentioned that the concerns of the Jewish community were crucial to him. “Why?” I asked. He hesitated. “I don’t tell many people, but my wife is Jewish and so are my children.” Comte is Catholic. The one time he had met Sammy Ghozlan was when Comte went to his in-laws’ synagogue in Le Blanc-Mesnil. “I knew him only from his reputation. He’s a hero of mine,” Comte said.

Like many in his situation, Comte now lives “a bit of a double life,” he said, in France. “I have told all my children, ‘Do not let anyone know you are Jewish. It is a private affair.’ But my youngest son, recently a Bar Mitzvah, insists on wearing a small Star of David. I let him know my concern. I said, ‘You must be careful.’ Now, when I go to synagogue, I have a gun that I carry in my coat pocket so no one can see it. It has come to that.”

Not long after the attack on the Hyper Cacher, representatives of the Ministry of the Interior appeared on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in Le Blanc-Mesnil. They had come to alert Ghozlan that he would now have a security detail posted at his house at all times. Ghozlan’s tenants informed them, “Mr. Ghozlan has moved from France,” and gave them his new address in Israel.

!German TV agrees to air anti-Semitism documentary following cries of censorship <image:6999>

Bds

Germany’s public broadcaster has agreed to air a new documentary on European anti-Semitism following accusations of censorship by local politicians, Jewish organizations and the State of Israel.

The ARD commissioned documentary “Chosen and Excluded – The Hate for Jews in Europe” was initially shelved for allegedly lacking balance, although the filmmakers told the Jerusalem Post that they believed that the broadcaster objected to its contention that “modern anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism.”

The movie examines the links between anti-Zionism and the BDS movement and contemporary Judeophobia and portions were filmed in Israel and the West Bank.

According to the Post, the German tabloid Bild posted a copy of the film on its website in order to combat what it saw as censorship. The paper’s editor explained that he believed that ARD saw the film as “politically unsuitable” because it highlighted “an anti-Semitic worldview in wide parts of society that is disturbing.”

ARD pushed back against the accusations, stating that it believed the film to have exceeded its mandate to focus on anti-Semitism, but the broadcaster eventually relented and “Chosen and Excluded” will air on Wednesday.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/france-braces-for-high-drama-run-offs-as-le-pens-far-right-eyes-power](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/france-braces-for-high-drama-run-offs-as-le-pens-far-right-eyes-power)) published an article on the French parliamentary elections in 2024, including a photograph of a protest <image:14110>. Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-10/french-far-right-parties-edge-toward-coalition-against-macron](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-10/french-far-right-parties-edge-toward-coalition-against-macron)) reports on the French far-right parties and their coalition against Macron, featuring an image of Marine Le Pen <image:14111>.

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-shifts-left-risk-policy-paralysis-looms-2024-07-08/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-shifts-left-risk-policy-paralysis-looms-2024-07-08/)) also published an article about the French parliamentary elections in 2024, including an image of a protest <image:14112>.


## Elaboration
The image in the claim (<image:20>

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, not a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory. The image has been taken out of context and misrepresented.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as evidenced by a Vanity Fair article ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)). This contradicts the claim that it depicts a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms the existence of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. The World Jewish Congress is associated with the IHRA definition. However, the evidence does not mention any amendments to the definition, nor does it mention the specific amendment claimed in the prompt.

To verify the claim, I need information about any amendments made to the IHRA definition, specifically whether the WJC was involved and if the JFK assassination was included.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. The World Jewish Congress is associated with the IHRA definition. However, the evidence does not mention any amendments to the definition, nor does it mention the specific amendment claimed in the prompt.

To verify the claim, I need information about any amendments made to the IHRA definition, specifically whether the WJC was involved and if the JFK assassination was included.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The World Jewish Congress is mentioned in a search result, which also includes an image of "THE WORKING DEFINITION OF ANTISEMITISM" <image:14120>. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism on May 26, 2016 <image:14122>.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. The World Jewish Congress is associated with the IHRA definition. However, the evidence does not mention any amendments to the definition, nor does it mention the specific amendment claimed in the prompt.

To verify the claim, I need information about any amendments made to the IHRA definition, specifically whether the WJC was involved and if the JFK assassination was included.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a handbook on the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism from the Canadian government <image:14125> and an image from Palestine Legal criticizing the IHRA definition <image:14127>.

## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context about the IHRA definition, including a handbook from the Canadian government and criticism from Palestine Legal. However, it still does not contain any information about the specific amendment claimed in the prompt.

The claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. I need to find information about any amendments to the IHRA definition, specifically whether the WJC was involved and if the JFK assassination was included.


## Actions
```
image_search("IHRA definition antisemitism JFK assassination")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The evidence confirms the existence of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism and the World Jewish Congress's involvement. However, there is no evidence to support the specific amendment mentioned in the claim, including the date (March 2025) or the inclusion of "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel."

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reveals reports of Hеzbollаh drone attacks on Tel Aviv and explosions in the city. However, there is no mention of Major General Tomer Bar being killed in any of these attacks.

The claim remains unverified. The evidence confirms attacks in Tel Aviv but does not link them to the death of Major General Tomer Bar.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

A massive fire that broke out at an oil refinery near Iran’s capital and sent a huge plume of black smoke into the sky over Tehran has been extinguished after more than 20 hours, a news agency reports.

The semi-official ISNA agency quotes the country’s deputy oil minister, Alireza Sadeghabadi as saying the blaze was first fully contained and then finally put out.

“The courageous actions by firefighters … led to the complete extinguishing of the fire and prevented the flames from spreading to other nearby tanks,” says Sadeghabadi, thanking the fire department.

The fire erupted at the state-owned Tondgooyan Petrochemical Co. to the south of Tehran last night. The Oil Ministry’s SHANA news agency says it was caused by a leak in two waste tanks at the facility. Authorities initially suggested the flames affected a liquified petroleum gas pipeline at the refinery.

Jalal Maleki, spokesman for the Tehran Fire Department, tells state TV that 10 fire department stations, including 60 heavy operating vehicles and more than 180 firefighters, took part in the operation to battle the blaze.

A massive fire broke out Wednesday night at the oil refinery serving Iran’s capital, sending thick plumes of black smoke over Tehran. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were injuries.

The fire struck the state-owned Tondgooyan Petrochemical Co. to the south of Tehran, said Mansour Darajati, the director-general of the capital’s crisis management team.

Firefighters believe it struck a pipeline for liquefied petroleum gas at the facility, Darajati told Iranian state television. He did not elaborate.

Associated Press journalists in central Tehran, some 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) away, could see the black smoke rise in the distance. Another AP journalist saw flames shooting into the sky from the site.

Mojtaba Khaledi, the spokesman for Iran’s emergency department, told the semiofficial ISNA news agency that 10 ambulances and other equipment had been deployed at the scene of the fire. Hospitals in the area are on standby as well, he said.

It wasn’t immediately clear what started the blaze. Temperatures in Tehran reached nearly 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Wednesday. Hot summer weather in Iran has caused fires in the past.

The [blaze came the same day a fire](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-irans-largest-warship-catches-fire-sinks-in-gulf-of-oman-2/)
 struck the largest warship in the Iranian navy, which later sank in the Gulf of Oman.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

From [Source](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/): Found exact image on website with title: US takes out al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan
Content: "Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed while standing on the balcony of his safe house in Afghanistan when a CIA drone sent two Hellfire missiles to pulverize the terror leader and plotter of the 9/11 terror attacks.

The precision strike took place in the heart of downtown Kabul during the early hours Saturday, ending a 21-year manhunt for Osama bin Laden’s successor and marking the most significant US counterterror operation since the 2019 slaying of ISIS commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The terror leader had stepped onto his balcony in the Shirpur neighborhood of Kabul when the US drone fired two specially designed RX9 Hellfire missiles dubbed “sword bombs” due to the blades that allow the weapon to tear through metal and walls without destroying entire structures.

President Biden confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death during an evening address in which he declared, “Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more.”

“Now we make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide: If you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,” Biden said.

Biden said of al-Zawahiri, “For decades, he was the mastermind behind the attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more.”

“He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others. He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, American diplomats and American interests.”

 [!Map of drone strike <image:7049> 7](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/kabul-strike-new.jpg "Open a slideshow of all 7 article images.")

The drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death near Kabul.

None of al-Zawahiri’s family members were hurt and there were no civilian casualties, the president said, calling the mission to eliminate the terrorist leader a “total success.”

The president also warned: “To those around the world who have continued to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe.”

Biden’s remarks from the Blue Room balcony of the White House were reminiscent of President Barack Obama’s late-night announcement of the death of bin Laden in Pakistan more than 11 years ago.

“After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents \[George W.\] Bush, Obama and \[Donald\] Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year,” Biden said.

“He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike to remove him from the battlefield once and for all.

“This mission was carefully planned and rigorously to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him.”

Biden added: “We will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone. And we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”

“You know, it can’t be a launching pad against the United States. We’re gonna see to it that won’t happen,” he said.

“This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can and will always make good on that solid, solid pledge.

Ayman al-Zawahri was reportedly killed by a US strike over the weekend. REUTERS

Fox News, citing two intelligence sources, first reported on the death of the Egyptian-born surgeon who took over the terrorist group behind the Sept. 11 attacks after bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in 2011.

Al-Zawahiri had a $25 million bounty on his head over his indictment in the 1998 embassy bombings.

He’s also believed to have helped coordinate the atrocities that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., 21 years ago, which were masterminded by bin Laden and planned by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, pending trial by a military tribunal.

Biden addresses the successful operation in Afghanistan from the White House Monday night. Reuters

Current and former officials began hearing Sunday afternoon that he’d been killed in a drone strike, sources told the Associated Press, but the administration delayed releasing the information until his death could be confirmed.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid [confirmed in a statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1554187982407696387)
 Monday that a drone strike on a home in Kabul had taken place the day before.

The house was owned by a top aide to senior Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior intelligence official told AP, raising questions about whether al-Zawahiri had received sanctuary from the Islamist group following the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.

The official added that a CIA ground team and aerial reconnaissance conducted after the drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death.

A senior Biden administration official noted: “Haqqani Taliban members took actions after the strike to conceal Zawahiri’s former presence at the location.”

“We have identified a concerted effort to restrict access to the safe house in the surrounding area for hours after the strike,” the official said.

“The safe house used by Zawahiri is now empty.”

The Taliban spokesman said, “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.

“Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan and the region,” Zabihullah wrote.

“Repeating such actions will damage the available opportunities.”

Al-Zawahiri ascended in al Qaeda after bin Laden was killed in 2011. AP

Al-Zawahiri and bin Laden are believed to have met in the late 1980s, when al-Zawahiri reportedly treated the Saudi millionaire in the caves of Afghanistan as Soviet bombardments shook the mountains around them.

Al-Zawahiri merged his group of Egyptian militants with bin Laden’s al Qaeda in the 1990s, and photos from that period often showed the two men sitting side by side.

Bin Laden provided al Qaeda with charisma and money, but al-Zawahiri brought tactics and organizational skills needed to forge militants into a network of cells in countries around the world.

“The strong contingent of Egyptians \[in al Qaeda\] applied organizational know-how, financial expertise, and military experience to wage a violent jihad against leaders whom the fighters considered to be un-Islamic and their patrons, especially the United States,” Steven A. Cook wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations last year.

There have been rumors of al-Zawahiri’s death for several years, but a video that surfaced in April showed him praising an Indian Muslim woman who had defied a ban on wearing a hijab, or headscarf.

That footage was the first proof in months that he was still alive.

As with bin Laden, al-Zawahiri’s whereabouts had been unknown before the operation that led to his death, though the most common rumors placed him either in Afghanistan or in Pakistan’s near-lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border.

Biden last year in an address said that US does not need to be on ground to fight terrorists. Last Sunday, the CIA showed how it can be done by killing Ayman al-Zawahiri

The US planned to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri over a period of several months. On July 31, 2022, two Hellfire missiles fired using a US drone ended the life of the al-Qaeda chief while he was sitting outside in his balcony, mincing him into shreds but without any damage to other individuals.

The CIA officials who were involved in the mission, according to _the Associated Press_, constructed “a pattern of life" and knew that Ayman al-Zawahiri liked sitting on the balcony of his building, which is located in Kabul’s Sherpur area.

Once his daily routine was established by the officials, they presented it to US president Joe Biden in the White House’s Situation Room weeks before the attack.

The officials were also aware that the Haqqani Taliban network provided the housing to Ayman al-Zawahiri and his family in Kabul. The AP reported that Zawahiri’s family along with him started living in the house once the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021.

People familiar with the developments told _CNNNews18_ that the building is close to Iranian and Turkish embassies.

After the US officials confirmed these details, they took more months to formulate an action plan. Several independent teams of analysts were brought on board to ensure that nearby civilians and infrastructure should not be targeted.

! <image:7070>

Another official familiar with the developments said that the now deceased al-Qaeda leader’s identity was verified on multiple occasions and for sustained periods of time before getting approval for the attack.

The plans were first formed in early April when two senior national security officials were first briefed on the intelligence. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan was then apprised of the developments. Over the next two months, a small group of officials of the US government vetted the intel and devised options for US president Biden.

Biden, when apprised of the developments in July, shortly after he returned from his Europe trip, bombarded CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and National Counterterrorism Centre director Christy Abizaid regarding the accuracy of the data presented to him.

Biden made it clear that the attack should not lead to results like the 2021 drone attack that ended up killing civilians in Kabul. He also said that Afghans who helped the US should not be in jeopardy.

Biden gave the go-ahead after July 25, while he was recovering from Covid .

The success of the attack was confirmed when the Haqqani Taliban network restricted access to the safe house and relocated Zawahiri’s family.

“I authorized the precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This measure was carefully planned, rigorously, to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians," Biden said in his address where he confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader, who headed the terrorist group for more than a decade, was eliminated.

The house where Al-Qaeda emir Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed, 31 July 2022

Ayman al-Zawahiri, the 71-year-old emir of Al-Qaeda, was killed in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, on 31 July 2022—one year ago today. Al-Zawahiri’s long life involved in Islamic militancy is interesting in itself, and can tell us a lot about where the jihadist movement is and where it is trending, notably his intellectual evolution towards a more “localist” program and the clash with the Islamic State, and perhaps even more immediately—in terms of his successor as Al-Qaeda’s leader—the relationships Al-Zawahiri fostered with various States, specifically Pakistan and Iran.

**JIHAD AT HOME**


-------------------

Al-Zawahiri was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 19 June 1951 to a [prominent elite family](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286)
: one of his great-uncles, Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, was the first general-secretary of the Arab League between 1945 and 1952, and his grandfather, Rabia al-Zawahiri, had been the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, once the most prestigious institution in the Sunni world before it became a drab adjunct of the military regime. Al-Zawahiri got involved with Islamic militancy early in his life, [joining](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/10/alqaida.terrorism)
 the Muslim Brotherhood in 1965 while he was at school, aged 14. Al-Zawahiri’s ideological devotion cannot be doubted: this was at the nadir for Egypt’s Islamists—albeit this turned out, as he had no way of knowing, to be the darkness before the dawn.

The Brotherhood and like-minded groups had welcomed the military coup in July 1952 that liquidated the gentle Western-aligned monarchy, hoping that it would lead to Islamic government. It swiftly became apparent they had miscalculated: pan-Arabism would be the creed of the new order. In 1954, the Soviet-aligned ruler, Gamal Abdel Nasser, initiated a severe crackdown on the Brotherhood that [they call](https://eeradicalization.com/the-history-and-ideology-of-the-muslim-brotherhood-an-interview-with-joas-wagemakers/)
 the _mihna_ (inquisition). The Brotherhood’s leading ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was arrested at this time, accused (probably correctly) of trying to assassinate Nasser. Qutb was released in May 1964, but [arrested again](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2015/bulletin_e2015_6.pdf)
 in August 1965, accused of trying to overthrow the government. 17,000 Islamists were [swept up](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/11/2002115486/-1/-1/0/21AYMANALZAWAHIRI.PDF)
 in the 1965-66 crackdown. In August 1966, Qutb was sent to the gallows.

The Islamists, however, were on the eve of an event that would hand them victory in the struggle with the pan-Arabists. Perhaps the central organising principle of pan-Arabism was the intention to uproot the Zionist project. The Arab States tried, after the restoration of Israel in 1948, to, in the infamous phrase of the era, “[throw the Jews into the sea](https://aijac.org.au/australia-israel-review/scribblings-a-sea-change/)
”. They failed, but the war continued by other means, with efforts to economically suffocate the Jewish State, a cross-border terrorist campaign,[1](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-1-135614300)
 and political warfare, notably via the [Palestine Liberation Organisation](https://www.commentary.org/articles/bernard-lewis/the-palestinians-and-the-plo/)
 (PLO) after 1964, an instrument that would in due course [pass to the Soviets](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/why-putins-regime-says-jews-are-the)
. In June 1967, Nasser—in collaboration with Syria and Jordan—[made a play](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nasser-s-speech-to-the-egyptian-national-assembly-may-1967)
 to “deal with the entire Palestine Question”. Nasser’s failure was no less calamitous than 1948-49. The Israelis pre-empted the attack and pan-Arabism was shattered alongside the armies of the two radical republics, Egypt and Syria.

If Islamism was not quite born on the seventh day of the Six-Day War, it was then that it began to [move into the mainstream](https://www.commentary.org/articles/bernard-lewis/the-return-of-islam/)
. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, a course had been set for reform and various ideas imported from Europe—Nazism, Communism, nationalism—were tried towards that end. All had only made things worse. The Islamist narrative that it was this ethos of foreign-inspired change that was at fault, that the answer was to return to the indigenous faith, always had its plausibility and appeal—and spoke in a language most could understand, rather than in the alien terms of imported Western ideologies. Now it appeared a verdict had been rendered from heaven.

History was breaking the Islamists’ way. In September 1970, Nasser, their great tormentor, died, and his successor, Anwar al-Sadat, had bigger problems. Egypt was being colonised from within by the Soviet Union. In 1972, Al-Sadat [ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/why-sadat-packed-off-the-russians-egypt.html)
 the Soviet intelligence “advisers” and troops out. In the shadow of the 1968 [Soviet invasion of its dissident Czechoslovak colony](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/socialism-could-never-have-a-human)
, there was no guarantee the Soviets would leave. The Soviets decided to comply, but initiated an active measures campaign to destabilise Al-Sadat’s regime, including a subversion offensive through Egypt’s internal Communist activists and agents.[2](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-2-135614300)
 To counter the Left, Al-Sadat tilted towards the Islamists: he would style himself “the Believing President”,[3](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-3-135614300)
 and, after the Brotherhood [formally renounced](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg31367/html/CHRG-115hhrg31367.htm)
 violence, it began various forms of cooperation with the State. Many Islamists were released from prison, including, in October 1971, [Muhammad Qutb](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2015/bulletin_e2015_6.pdf)
, who built on his brother’s ideas to [develop concepts later taken on](https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/06/13/sectarianism-of-islamic-state-ideological-roots-and-political-context/j1iy)
 by the jihadi-Salafists.

This caused some splintering among the Islamists, as more radical factions broke away from the Brotherhood to form clearly anti-State organisations—some of which [also received Soviet support](https://jamestown.org/program/a-russian-agent-at-the-right-hand-of-bin-laden-2/)
. Probably the most powerful of these groups at the time was the **Islamic Group (**_**Jamaat al-Islamiyya**_**)**. Another, which Al-Zawahiri joined in 1973, was **Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ)**. The Jamaat and EIJ were rivals to an extent, though they often collaborated. Umar Abd al-Rahman, “the Blind Shaykh”, would become firmly associated with the Jamaat a decade later, but in the mid-1970s the nature of these networks made his [allegiances rather more fluid](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86743/1/Gohel_Deciphering%20Al-Qaeda_2018.pdf)
 and, even after the 1980s, EIJ set great store by Abd al-Rahman as a spiritual guide.

Al-Zawahiri, who had earned his medical degree in 1974 from Cairo University, was involved in the [Military Technical College revolt](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/11/2002115486/-1/-1/0/21AYMANALZAWAHIRI.PDF)
 in 1975. In 1978, Al-Zawahiri [gained](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286)
 a surgical master’s degree.

The **Islamic Revolution in Iran** reached its crescendo in late 1978, right as Al-Sadat was signing the peace accords that made Egypt the first Arab State to recognise Israel. Unwilling to shed blood to save his throne, the [Shah left his country](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/01/17/the-fall-of-the-shah-and-the-rise-of-islamism/)
 in January 1979 and in March 1980—after a grisly international journey—settled in Egypt; four months later he was dead. If the Six-Day War lit the touchpaper, the Shah’s fall kindled Islamism into a blaze: the seemingly most powerful ruler in the region—the one most unapologetically aligned to the West and Israel—had been brought down and replaced with an Islamist regime. The dream was possible.

The Islamists in Iran had been [assisted by Soviet-run Communists](https://www.meforum.org/62821/whither-iran-tehrans-russian-connection)
 during the Revolution and afterwards. For a time, [some even thought](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/the-shahs-view-of-the-revolution)
 the Red would triumph over the Black. By 1983, Ayatollah Khomeini ruled supreme, having destroyed his main Islamist rival, the [even-more radical](https://kyleorton1991.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/central-intelligence-agency-august-1981-iran-the-mujahedin-a.k.a.-mujahideen-e-khalq-or-mek.pdf)
 Mojahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), and the various organised Leftist factions. The Marxist inflection in Khomeini’s Revolution remained, however, visible in the way it cast itself as a movement on behalf of the _mostazafin_ (oppressed). The other key part of this was its non-sectarianism: Khomeini was Supreme Leader of the _Islamic_ Republic; in time, it was hoped, the Sunnis would see their error. Pending that, the Shi’a clergy would work with Sunni militants to export their Revolution.[4](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-4-135614300)
 Al-Zawahiri became a “[poster boy](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-mullahs-manhattan-project/)
” for Iran’s revolutionary clergy. The relationship Al-Zawahiri forged with Tehran four decades ago lasted throughout his lifetime. Sometimes the mutual admiration [was even public](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/3506544/Iran-receives-al-Qaeda-praise-for-role-in-terrorist-attacks.html)
.

In October 1981, the Islamists that Al-Sadat had given space to struck him down. “I have killed Pharaoh”, [announced Al-Sadat’s murderer](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1984/05/31/the-egyptian-murder-case/)
, Khaled al-Islambuli. “I am not afraid to die.” And die he would, shot by a firing squad in April 1982. The Iranian regime named a street in its capital after Al-Islambuli, celebrating him as a “martyr”.[5](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-5-135614300)
 Al-Islambuli was a [member of EIJ](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ310/html/PLAW-115publ310.htm)
 and had been assisted in getting to Al-Sadat by a colonel in his retinue, Abud al-Zumar, the first leader of EIJ. Al-Zawahiri was arrested in the dragnet that followed Al-Sadat’s assassination, which rounded up hundreds of Islamists. Al-Zawahiri was not charged with conspiring in the murder itself; he was [convicted of weapons charges](https://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/zawahiri/profile.html)
. When Al-Zawahiri was [released in 1984](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-islamist-militancy/in-free-egypt-jihad-leader-says-time-for-gun-is-over-idUSTRE72H62820110318)
, in his early 30s, he left Egypt and would never return.

**JIHAD ON THE ROAD**


-----------------------

In December 1979, the Soviet Union conquered Afghanistan and installed a puppet Communist regime. **Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency** used the Mujahideen groups it had created from Afghan Islamists a half-decade earlier to run an insurgency against the Soviet occupation.[6](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-6-135614300)
 By 1982, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia began sponsoring the Afghan anti-Soviet resistance,[7](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-7-135614300)
 but this was channelled through Pakistan’s ISI, which empowered its own assets, above all Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the most radical of the Islamists, whose ideology later fed into the global jihad movement.[8](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-8-135614300)

In 1984, a Palestinian shaykh, **Abdullah Azzam**, issued a _fatwa_ calling on all Muslims to fight the Soviets, and it provoked the first major foreign fighter flow, mostly of Arabs, to Afghanistan. Azzam created the Services Bureau (_al-Maktab al-Khidamat_), funded most significantly by Usama bin Laden, to facilitate this movement of foreigners. The “Arab-Afghans” did not receive direct State support for the simple reason that they were not an important military force in fighting the Soviet occupation: about 2,000 Arabs total (400 at any one time) were in Afghanistan amidst a Mujahideen force of perhaps a quarter-million.[9](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-9-135614300)
 Al-Zawahiri in his memoir is furious at the idea that the U.S. gave “one penny” to the Arab-Afghans.[10](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-10-135614300)
 The three battles in the late 1980s where the Arab-Afghans had a noteworthy contribution were military failures, but politically raised the profile of the Arab-Afghans,[11](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-11-135614300)
 and the politics among the Arab-Afghans was to have global significance.

In October 1986, Bin Laden created a military camp, the Lion’s Den of Supporters (_al-Masada al-Ansar_), which many simply called “the military base” (_al-Qaeda al-Askariyya_). It was out of the bureaucratic structures for the Masada camp that Al-Qaeda emerges around the spring of 1987: initially, “Al-Qaeda” referred to the camp and quickly evolved into a synonym for the _people_ associated with the camp, a group of Arab fighters operating as something like a special forces unit.[12](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-12-135614300)
 While Masada was to a degree established deliberately in isolation, physically and culturally, from the broader Mujahideen insurgency,[13](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-13-135614300)
 it had deep ties to some Mujahideen factions—[above all the Haqqanis](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
—that were very close to Pakistan’s ISI.[14](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-14-135614300)

In this period, the Arab-Afghans were diverging. Al-Zawahiri believed in the legitimacy of _takfir_ (excommunicating Muslims), especially against Arab rulers, in contrast to Azzam’s pan-Islamism that opposed _all_ Muslim-on-Muslim violence. The degree to which Al-Zawahiri was influencing Bin Laden in the late 1980s might be overstated,[15](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-15-135614300)
 but Azzam was certainly losing influence.[16](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-16-135614300)
 As the [Soviets wound down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/04/15/agreement-on-afghanistan-signed-in-geneva/c7288c64-6764-4e73-9bc5-7eeb48f7827d/)
 in Afghanistan in 1988, Azzam wanted to redirect the energy from the Afghan jihad to Palestine, for a war to eliminate Israel, an alien occupying power in his conception. Al-Zawahiri had a different script in mind: he wanted to separate the Arab-Afghans from even indirect allegiance with Muslim governments and have them war against the regime in Cairo, believing jihad should lead to the founding of a caliphate, starting in Egypt, “the heart of the Islamic world”.[17](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-17-135614300)
 The contest between Al-Zawahiri and Azzam ended as decisively as it dramatically in November 1989, when Azzam was killed in a highly public, highly mysterious bombing in Peshawar. The perpetrator remains unknown, but [Al-Zawahiri is on the suspects list](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/a-jihadi-murder-mystery-who-killed)
.

1991 was an important year in the development of Al-Qaeda. At the beginning of the year, the U.S.-led coalition—for once without Soviet opposition—reversed the annexation of Kuwait by Saddam Husayn’s Iraq. The Saudi government rejected Bin Laden’s call to “fight \[Saddam\] with faith” (his motley force of Arab-Afghans),[18](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-18-135614300)
 and in April 1991 Bin Laden left Saudi Arabia for the last time, moving to Pakistan.[19](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-19-135614300)
 The same year, Al-Zawahiri [took over EIJ](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/egyptian-islamic-jihad)
, which was now less a group than a dispersed network of Egyptian militants abroad. And at the end of the year, the Soviet Union collapsed. For the jihadists, this was their victory, and the Soviet demise was the destruction of the more dangerous of the two infidel superpowers; dealing with America, made soft by self-indulgence and decadence of all kinds, would be comparatively easy. “Hit them and they will run”, [Bin Laden repeatedly said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/09/10/targeted-by-a-history-of-hatred/13108985-1814-4aee-b74c-6767f131f03e/)
, citing the U.S. abandoning South Vietnam and Beirut after the Iran/Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in October 1983. Somalia would be added to the list after the U.S. withdrew from there in 1993.

Bin Laden [arrived in Sudan in December 1991](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/al_qaeda_sahel.pdf)
,[20](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-20-135614300)
 travelling from Afghanistan. Bin Laden had first been invited to Sudan by Hassan al-Turabi, the Muslim Brotherhood cleric who was the power behind the throne, soon after the military coup by Islamist officers in June 1989.[21](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-21-135614300)
 Bin Laden had not immediately taken the offer but had cultivated relations with Al-Turabi and begun setting up Sudan as a node in Al-Qaeda’s network. In 1990, “agents of Bin Laden began to buy property in Sudan”.[22](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-22-135614300)
 When Al-Turabi [went to Jordan](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/the-mother-of-all-connections)
 in October 1990 to show support for Saddam, two months after Saddam had occupied and annexed Kuwait, Al-Turabi’s entourage included Bin Laden emissaries who [established contact](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 with Saddam’s regime. In 1991, [Saddam returned the favour](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
, reaching out to Al-Qaeda through Sudan. Once Bin Laden was in Sudan, Al-Qaeda became fully intertwined with the Islamist regime, providing resources for its civil war against the Christians in the south, in exchange for Al-Qaeda receiving safe haven and the amenities of a State, like passports.

Al-Zawahiri was not “formally” a member of Al-Qaeda at this time, and was still, as emir of EIJ, a leading proponent of the “near enemy” school of jihad: direct war with the Muslim regimes to establish Islamist emirates that could link up into a caliphate. Bin Laden was moving towards the “far enemy” strategy, the idea that a global war against the American-led West was needed first, to push it out of the Middle East, because only then could Islamic revolutions locally succeed. The distinction between the “near enemy” and “far enemy” camps was never as sharp as all that, though, demonstrated by Al-Zawahiri acting as Bin Laden’s roving ambassador in the first half of the 1990s and the training Al-Qaeda gave to “near enemy”-focused jihadists in the Afghan camps later in the decade.[23](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-23-135614300)

Al-Zawahiri, had made a [trip to Tehran in April 1991](https://ctc.usma.edu/marriage-of-convenience-the-evolution-of-iran-and-al-qaidas-tactical-cooperation)
 to gain financial support and training for an Islamic revolution in Egypt. Probably in early 1992, via Al-Zawahiri, Bin Laden [met with](https://kyleorton.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/united-states-v-ali-mohamed-plea-hearing-20-october-2000.pdf)
 Imad Mughniya, the officer of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in military control of Hizballah in Lebanon, to arrange for Al-Qaeda jihadists to receiving training. **This Al-Zawahiri-facilitated meeting was the start of an ever-deepening [relationship between Al-Qaeda and Iran](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/10/26/examining-irans-long-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
** that lasts to this day. Also in 1992, [Al-Zawahiri met with Saddam’s foreign intelligence chief](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
, Faruq Hijazi, in Khartoum, beginning a “highly secretive relationship with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and later with Al-Qaeda”. Contact was [maintained](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 between EIJ/Al-Qaeda and Saddam’s Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) through Hijazi in Sudan up to 1995, with additional meetings in Pakistan, and occasional visits by Al-Qaeda and affiliated jihadists to Baghdad, including Al-Zawahiri, who [went to the Iraqi capital](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/03/25/the-great-terror)
 in 1992 to meet Saddam himself.

The fact that Sudan in the 1990s acted as a nexus for Al-Qaeda and its jihadist allies with two notorious State-sponsors of anti-American terrorism, Saddam’s Iraq and Clerical Iran, was [well-known even in public discourse](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
, though it would later be “forgotten” that everyone knew this when political imperatives shifted.

**Al-Zawahiri arrived in Bosnia as early as September 1992**,[24](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-24-135614300)
 and would cycle in and out of the country over the next three-and-a-half years as part of the foreign jihadist contingent that was heavily inflected with Al-Qaeda operatives. In Bosnia, Al-Zawahiri [worked closely with Iran](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/01/23/from-bosnia-to-guantanamo/)
, which trained and utilised the jihadists in the war, and [embedded itself](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2020/02/05/iran-admits-collaborating-with-al-qaeda-in-bosnia/)
 in the [security apparatus](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/01/21/the-jihad-factor-in-bosnia/)
 of the Sarajevo government. The expanding web of jihadist connections and Iran’s assistance meant **the Bosnian war helped Al-Qaeda go truly global**.

In Yemen, Bin Laden’s [ancestral homeland](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/01/rags-to-riches-story-of-the-bin-laden-family-is-woven-with-tragedy)
, Al-Qaeda would fail to incite an Islamic revolution, but laid down infrastructure that served it as a logistics hub. This, too, was assisted by Iran, which had created its own Islamic revolutionary clone in Yemen on the Hizballah model, Ansarallah (a.k.a. the Huthis).[25](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-25-135614300)
 The key operative for Al-Qaeda’s establishment in Yemen was a senior official of Al-Zawahiri’s EIJ, **Ibrahim al-Banna (Abu Ayman al-Masri)**,[26](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-26-135614300)
 who went to Yemen,[27](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-27-135614300)
 [probably in 1993](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/an-al-qaeda-commander-comes-out-from-the-shadows.php)
, under instructions from Al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda’s then-military emir, **Ali Amin al-Rashidi (Abu Ubayda al-Panjshiri)**, who had [just spent ten months](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/al-qaedas-first-military-emir/)
 in Yemen. Al-Zawahiri [personally visited Yemen](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 in 1994 to check on Al-Banna’s progress. Al-Banna set about forging relationships with local jihadist leaders and tribes, and [worked closely](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/twenty-years-after-9-11-the-jihadi-threat-in-the-arabian-peninsula/)
 with the IRGC’s Ansarallah, acquiring weapons and other forms of support to smuggle operatives into Saudi Arabia, seeding the networks that Al-Qaeda used to launch a jihadist revolt in the Kingdom from 2003 to 2005.[28](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-28-135614300)
 The beaten Saudi Al-Qaeda operatives would retreat to Yemen and merge with their Yemeni network to form Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the third of Al-Qaeda’s “affiliates”, Al-Banna having helped set up the first in Iraq that we now know as the Islamic State.[29](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-29-135614300)

 AQAP’s security and intelligence chief, and AQAP [retains](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/reduced-but-rebuilding-united-nations)
 its relationship with Ansarallah/Iran.

In May 1996, Bin Laden had been expelled from Sudan, under American pressure, and moved to Afghanistan, where [the ISI had switched to the Taliban](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/08/17/pakistan-and-the-taliban/)
, after tiring of the Mujahideen, as its favoured instrument for colonising the country. Bin Laden came to a similar arrangement with the Taliban regime as he had in Sudan, only with deeper foundations, practically and [ideologically](https://www.jihadica.com/al-qaeda%E2%80%99s-quasi-caliph-the-recasting-of-mullah-%E2%80%98umar/)
: Bin Laden pledged allegiance (_bay’a_) to Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Umar as Commander of the Faithful (_Emir al-Mumineen_). The U.S. had miscalculated in having Bin Laden forced out of Sudan. It transpired to be more advantageous for Al-Qaeda to be in Afghanistan.

There were two other major jihadi hotspots in the mid-1990s into which Al-Qaeda inserted itself, in [Algeria](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/03/21/algerias-years-of-blood-not-quite-what-they-seem/)
 and Chechnya. **Al-Zawahiri’s trip to Chechnya, in southern Russia, in December 1996, is [one of the strangest episodes](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/08/how-russia-manipulates-islamic-terrorism/)
 in the history of the jihadi-Salafist movement**. Al-Zawahiri was arrested soon after his arrival, alongside [Ahmad Salama Mabruk](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/10/04/al-qaeda-in-syria-and-american-policy/)
 (Abu Faraj al-Masri) and Mahmud Hisham al-Hennawi, and imprisoned until May 1997. Al-Zawahiri was then let go and allowed to continue his work among the jihadists in the Caucasus, before rendezvousing with Bin Laden in Afghanistan. The Russian claim that it only later learned Al-Zawahiri’s identity is not credible. Moscow had surely come across Al-Zawahiri in the 1970s, when it was [covertly supporting EIJ](https://jamestown.org/program/a-russian-agent-at-the-right-hand-of-bin-laden-2/#.VEWC9vnF_jU)

 as a prisoner in 1982. If the FSB, the KGB’s successor, had not recognised Al-Zawahiri by sight, it likely would have learned it in interrogation. Al-Zawahiri had [broken under torture](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304569504576403503586643690)

**MOVING TO GLOBAL JIHAD**


----------------------------

Al-Qaeda had been [linked to terrorist attacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4677978)
 against the West earlier in the 1990s—the hotel bombings in Yemen in December 1992, the first World Trade Centre attack in New York in February 1993, in Somalia during the “Black Hawk down” incident in October 1993, the foiled 9/11 precursor “Bojinka plot” in January 1995, and the bombing against U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia in November 1995—but it was only after Al-Zawahiri’s Russian sojourn that he got on board with the “far enemy” strategy. Bin Laden had issued his [first fatwa](https://ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Declaration-of-Jihad-against-the-Americans-Occupying-the-Land-of-the-Two-Holiest-Sites-Translation.pdf)
 declaring jihad against American in August 1996 and in February 1998 issued a second fatwa—by some accounts “encouraged” by Al-Zawahiri[30](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-30-135614300)
—that [declared all-out war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/saudi-arabia/1998-11-01/license-kill-usama-bin-ladins-declaration-jihad)
 against Americans and Jews globally. The 1998 statement was inter alia [signed by Al-Zawahiri](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm)
 and [Rifai Taha](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2017/01/20/the-coalition-strikes-down-al-qaedas-leaders-in-syria/)
 (Abu Yasser al-Masri), then-operational head of the Jamaat since “the Blind Shaykh” was in prison.

The bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, which killed two-hundred people, made Al-Qaeda a household name, at least in Western security circles. Al-Zawahiri was [personally implicated](http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/18/alzawahiri.charges/)
 in the atrocities. The support of the Iranian regime [had been important](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/10/26/examining-irans-long-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
 in making the East Africa Embassy bombings possible and now Tehran was sure that Al-Qaeda meant business in its war with America, the relationship only deepened.

By 1998, Iran was not the only actor intensifying its interest in the increasingly lethal Al-Qaeda: Saddam was, too. Whether or not [Bin Laden himself had gone to Iraq](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 in January 1998, in February 1998—three weeks before the fatwa declaring war on America and Jews—Al-Zawahiri had gone to Baghdad again, meeting Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan “to arrange for coordination between Iraq and bin Laden”: there was talk of establishing training camps for Al-Qaeda on Iraqi territory and Al-Zawahiri was given $300,000.[31](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-31-135614300)
 By February 1998, the U.S. and Saddam were several months into a showdown that [seemed likely to end](https://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/17/transcripts/clinton.iraq/)
 with a U.S. invasion to depose Saddam. Saddam was ultimately [rescued by Kofi Annan](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/08/19/the-legacy-of-kofi-annan/)
 of the United Nations, but the danger never completely passed—the [Senate voted unanimously](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4655)
 to make it official U.S. policy to remove Saddam from power in October 1998—and Al-Qaeda was clearly viewed as a handy potential instrument for retaliation. In March 1998, two separate Al-Qaeda envoys went to Saddam’s Iraq,[32](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-32-135614300)
 one of them [spending more than two weeks in Baghdad](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
. At least one of the March 1998 meetings was “apparently arranged through … Zawahiri, who had _ties of his own_ to the Iraqis” \[italics added\], and it seems to have been Al-Zawahiri who arranged for a Saddamist “delegation” to visit Afghanistan in July 1998 to meet, “first with the Taliban and then with Bin Laden”.[33](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-33-135614300)
 ([Saddam and the Taliban](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/29/saddam-and-the-taliban/)
 also had independent relations.) The Saddam-Al-Qaeda relationship became important in late 1998 as Al-Qaeda’s relations with the Taliban faltered.

After the August 1996 fatwa, Taliban emir Mullah Umar, partly under pressure from Saudi Arabia, one of only three States to recognise the Taliban government, had asked Bin Laden to cease public incitement against America and generally keep a low profile.[34](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-34-135614300)
 Bin Laden clearly ignored this, for example giving [an interview to Peter Arnett](https://edition.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/12/05/gen.arnett.cnna/index.html)
 of _CNN_ in March 1997, where Bin Laden infamously threatened America live on television, and after the Embassy bombings in August 1998 Bin Laden did another media blitz claiming responsibility, ensuring that retaliatory strikes fell on Taliban Afghanistan. The IIS station in Iraq’s Pakistan Embassy [became](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)

Later in the month, shortly after President Bill Clinton ordered the bombing campaign (Operation DESERT FOX) against [Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) infrastructure](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/12/22/why-was-there-ever-an-american-occupation-of-iraq/)
, Hijazi, by this point Iraq’s ambassador in Turkey, also journeyed to Afghanistan to meet Bin Laden. Hijazi [returned](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 for another visit in January 1999. What is most interesting, especially in retrospect, is that these 1998-99 moves in the Saddam-Qaeda relationship were [all reported in real time](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
 in Western newspapers that denied any such relationship existed three years later.

The culmination of Saddam’s interplay with Al-Qaeda was a proposal in early 1999 for Bin Laden and his organisation, including Al-Zawahiri, to move to Iraq. The U.S. was especially trepidatious about Bin Laden taking shelter under Saddam’s roof because it would have made U.S. plans to kill the Al-Qaeda leader—then at their height—impossible. The U.S. was in a catch-22, however, because if it operationalised an assassination mission against Bin Laden, this would be discovered by Pakistan, which would detect the U-2 flights needed to locate Bin Laden before airstrikes were launched, and the ISI would then tip-off Bin Laden, triggering his move to Iraq before any bombing run could take place—putting him out of the U.S.’s reach.[35](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-35-135614300)
 This limbo created by the Pakistanis persisted essentially up to 9/11.

Bin Laden ultimately decided not to take the Iraqi offer and patched things up with the Taliban, agreeing to cease his media appearances: this was partly [under criticism](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/14/al-qaeda-central-in-syria/)
 from senior Arab jihadist figures like **Muhammad al-Bahaya (Abu Khalid al-Suri)** and **Mustafa Setmariam Nasar (Abu Musab al-Suri)**, partly because 9/11 was in the works and he needed less American attention, and partly because the U.S. strikes on Afghanistan after the Embassy bombings had, [unbeknownst to everyone at the time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1028236160532452080)
, reconciled the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, becoming “a rallying point for defiance of America and shut off Taliban discussion of expelling the militants”. The Taliban had never been opposed to anti-American terrorism; they had told Bin Laden he was quite at liberty to “fight America”, but they had insisted he should “do so without much talk and shouting from our lands”.[36](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-36-135614300)
 Bin Laden finally did as he was told. In October 2000, Al-Qaeda carried out its last major pre-9/11 attack, blowing up an American warship, the U.S.S. _Cole_, in the Aden harbour, killing seventeen servicemen: Bin Laden was nowhere to be seen—and nor was any American response.

Al-Zawahiri was involved in the efforts Al-Qaeda made to construct WMD in Afghanistan in 2000-01, including acting as a link for the recruitment of experts from Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in Indonesia, led by Al-Qaeda operative Riduan Isamuddin, born [Encep Nurjaman](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/us/politics/guantanamo-bali-bombing.html)
, and universally known as “Hambali”.[37](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-37-135614300)
 (There was an Iraq dimension to this story, too, around Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, which later became [the subject of much controversy](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/12/28/the-cia-and-iraq-intelligence-failures-media-successes/)
.)

**AL-ZAWAHIRI AND 9/11**


--------------------------

The architect of the 9/11 plot was Khaled Shaykh Muhammad (KSM), a Pakistani citizen, who had been involved in the Mujahideen war against the Soviets and the Bosnian jihad. KSM had then been involved in various Islamist terrorist plots across the world. KSM was the uncle of the lead conspirator in the World Trade Centre attack in 1993, Ramzi Yusef, with whom he had planned the Bojinka operation,[38](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-38-135614300)
 which also [involved Hambali](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list/summaries/individual/nurjaman-riduan-isamuddin)
. In January 1996, KSM moved to Afghanistan, establishing contact with Al-Qaeda’s military chief, [Muhammad Atef](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/profile-of-a-9-11-planner-muhammad-atef/)
 (Abu Hafs al-Masri), and through Atef attained a meeting with Bin Laden soon after he arrived in Afghanistan months later, where “KSM presented the Al-Qaeda leader with a menu of ideas for terrorist operations”.[39](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-39-135614300)
 At this first meeting, KSM proposed the “Planes Operation” that would become 9/11. Bin Laden listened “without much comment” and asked KSM to join Al-Qaeda and move his family to Afghanistan.[40](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-40-135614300)
 KSM refused to give _bay’a_ to Bin Laden and left his family in Iran, moving them to Pakistan in January 1997.[41](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-41-135614300)
 Contact waned between KSM and Bin Laden through 1997, but, after the East African Embassy bombings, KSM got back in touch with Bin Laden and “sometime in late 1998 or early 1999”, Bin Laden gave the “green light” for the 9/11 operation.[42](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-42-135614300)

The 9/11 plot was an “off-the-books operation” within Al-Qaeda: the executive body, the Consultation Council (_Majlis al-Shura_), was kept in the dark.[43](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-43-135614300)
 **Only three people—Bin Laden, KSM, and Atef—“developed \[the\] initial list of targets”**.[44](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-44-135614300)
 **Al-Zawahiri was the next to be brought into the plot**,[45](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-45-135614300)
 tasked with trying to find “potential sponsors in the Gulf”.[46](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-46-135614300)
 (It had been inter alia a lack of money that had made Bin Laden hesitant about the “Planes Operation” when KSM first proposed it in 1996.)

While KSM never would formally join Al-Qaeda, Al-Zawahiri did, **[merging EIJ](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/16/the-man-behind-bin-laden)
 with Bin Laden’s outfit in June 2001**. There are two notable things about this. First, EIJ’s sense of itself as a “[national-revolutionary](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413161153/http:/www.jihadica.com/al-qaeda-revives-its-beef-with-the-islamic-state/)
” group remained strong enough that a large section refused to follow Al-Zawahiri and split away. Second, the merger primarily served as an attempt to stack the _Shura_ so Bin Laden could gain its retrospective approval for 9/11. Six of the nine _Shura_ seats were held by EIJ members loyal to Al-Zawahiri when Bin Laden revealed his plan to attack America to it on 27 June 2001, though it never actually came to a vote: the discussion exposed so much dissent, even among the Egyptians, that Bin Laden declared “the matter had already been decided” and ended the meeting.[47](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-47-135614300)

At [8:46](https://timeline.911memorial.org/#Timeline/2)
 on the morning of 11 September 2001, Al-Qaeda smashed a plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre. By just after 10:00, planes had struck the South Tower and the Pentagon, and Flight 93 was brought down by a passenger revolt near Shanksville in Pennsylvania. Half-an-hour later, the Twin Towers were a heap of rubble. 3,000 people were dead and 25,000 had been wounded.

The U.S. demanded the perpetrators, specifically Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri,[48](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-48-135614300)
 be handed over, and the Taliban, [encouraged by Pakistan](https://aljumhuriya.net/en/2018/01/24/states-saved-al-qaeda/)
, decided it would rather give up its regime than surrender Bin Laden to the Americans. On 7 October 2001, the U.S. began the invasion of Afghanistan. Atef was killed in mid-November 2001, the first major scalp of the War on Terror. Shortly afterwards, Al-Zawahiri [“favourite” wife](https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/zawahiris-letter-to-zarqawi-original-language-2/)
, Azza Ahmed Nuwair, was killed in an airstrike, along with two of his children, a source of personal bitterness against the Americans that Al-Zawahiri has repeatedly made reference to.

Cornered at Tora Bora, Al-Qaeda was [rescued by Pakistan and Iran](https://aljumhuriya.net/en/2018/01/24/states-saved-al-qaeda/)
: the Pakistanis drew away their troops, intended to prevent escape as the Americans closed in, for a confrontation with India, and the Iranians deputised Hekmatyar—who had put himself in the service of the IRGC after the ISI discarded him for the Taliban—to bring Al-Qaeda’s military and religious leadership, and Bin Laden’s family, to safety within Iran.

Bin Laden kept on the move over the next four years, reportedly first basing himself in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan, where he met Iranian agents in Shegal to enquire about recovering his family from Iran and sometimes slipping over the border to Karachi,[49](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-49-135614300)
 before moving into the north-western tribal areas of Pakistan, cycling through towns like Shangla,[50](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-50-135614300)
 Haripur, and ultimately settling in the compound where he was found in Abbottabad in August 2005.[51](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-51-135614300)
 Pakistan would play dumb about the Qaeda presence in Abbottabad in 2011, but, in 2004, no less a person than then-Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, [wrote in his memoir](https://www.rferl.org/a/abbottabad_not_a_new_home_for_terror/24093251.html)
 that he knew of a network of Al-Qaeda safehouses in the town, one of which contained “someone important in Al-Qaeda”. After KSM was [arrested](https://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/01/pakistan.arrests/)
 in a CIA-led operation in March 2003 in Rawalpindi, near the Pakistani capital, in the home of a senior official of one the ISI-supported political parties, Jamaat-e-Islami, he was replaced as head of external operations by Mustafa al-Uzaybi (Abu Faraj al-Libi). The ISI has [publicly acknowledged](https://www.rferl.org/a/abbottabad_not_a_new_home_for_terror/24093251.html)
 searching a house in Abbottabad looking for Al-Uzaybi as early as 2003 and Al-Uzaybi was eventually captured in Mardan, a town two hours west of Abbottabad, not far from the old Arab-Afghan “capital” of Peshawar.

For much of the last twenty years, Al-Zawahiri’s “[whereabouts \[have\] … been a mystery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/01/zawahiri-al-qaeda-killed/)
”. The one reasonably solid lead on Al-Zawahiri’s hideout came after Al-Uzaybi [disclosed in custody](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pakistan-demands-no-airstrike-repeat/)
 that shortly beforehand he had met with Al-Zawahiri in Damadola in the Bajaur area of what was then the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in north-west Pakistan. **One of the first U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan targeted Al-Zawahiri in Damadola in January 2006** during what was believed to be [a meeting with Faqir Muhammad](https://ctc.usma.edu/a-profile-of-tehrik-i-taliban-pakistan/)
, the deputy leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or “Pakistani” Taliban after its official announcement in 2007. How close the U.S. got to Al-Zawahiri that day is contested. The main takeaway from the incident was how intimately tied TTP is to Al-Qaeda and by extension the rest of the ISI network that includes the “Afghan” Taliban and the so-called [Haqqani Network](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
.[52](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-52-135614300)
 Making the point in a different way, a lot of [circumstantial evidence over the years](https://medium.com/@asfandyarmir/where-is-ayman-al-zawahiri-fb37e459c6a9)
 points to Al-Zawahiri having been under TTP protection in eastern Afghanistan. There was a claim around 2016 that Al-Zawahiri had “shifted his permanent base to Iran”.[53](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-53-135614300)
 This was evidently untrue: a visit, perhaps even an extended one, is certainly possible—a Taliban leader was [killed in the same period](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/death-of-mullah-mansoor-highlights-talibans-links-with-iran)
 returning to Pakistan from Iran—but he clearly did not stay there.

**LEADING AL-QAEDA: REBELLION FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN**


--------------------------------------------------------------

Al-Zawahiri was [named](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11489337)
 as Al-Qaeda’s new emir on 16 June 2011, six weeks after the U.S. Navy SEALs caught up with Bin Laden. The organization Al-Zawahiri took over was an international network very different to the special forces-type outfit Bin Laden founded in 1987. In the first decade of the twentieth century, Al-Qaeda had expanded beyond its military assistance mission for the Arab-Afghans in Afghanistan to provide such services to local insurgencies abroad, recognising some of these as branches or “affiliates” under a [system it called “Al-Qalim”](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/14/the-structure-of-al-qaeda/)
. The [first branch in 2004](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/bitstream/handle/10066/4757/ZAR20041017P.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y)
 was **Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia (AQM)**, which had a [complicated relationship](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
 with Al-Qaeda Central (AQC) after 2006 until AQM was [cast out](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/03/21/ayman-al-zawahiri-expels-isis-from-al-qaeda/)
 by Al-Zawahiri in 2014 and renamed itself the Islamic State (IS). In 2006, with [help from](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/world/africa/01transcript-droukdal.html)

, and the jihadist insurgency in Somalia had been under AQC’s command since [at least this time](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2009/11/al_qaeda_names_fazul.php)
, but Bin Laden [advised](https://kyleorton.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bin-Laden-Letters.pdf#page=35)
 **Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahideen** to keep its allegiance secret, which it did [until 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16979440)
.

Al-Zawahiri took over amid the “Arab Spring”. Tunisia’s autocrat had been put to flight and in Egypt the crowds had done what Al-Zawahiri had been trying to do for thirty years, bringing down Al-Sadat’s dutiful successor, Hosni Mubarak, who was [once described](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/1995-09-01/sorrows-egypt)
 as “a civil servant with the rank of president”. Yemen’s long-time ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh had [nearly](https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-57481820110603)
 been shelled out of office and Libya was in full-scale rebellion against Colonel Muamar al-Qaddafi, which NATO had [stepped in to assist](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/10/21/why-nato-was-right-to-intervene-in-libya/)
. Al-Zawahiri’s [first released speech](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/07/28/al.qaeda.leader.message/index.html)
 as leader, however, in late July 2011, focused Syria, at that time four months into a generally peaceful uprising that had been met with pitiless brutality by Bashar al-Asad’s regime, assisted by Iran. Al-Zawahiri encouraged Syrians to adopt the way of jihad and not to look to the U.S. for support. It was to be events in Syria that more than any other shaped Al-Zawahiri’s tenure as Al-Qaeda’s emir.

Some [took the view](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704436004576299110143040714)
 that “the Arab Spring has simply overwhelmed the world of the jihadists.” Unfortunately, this was not so. The breakdown of States and the outbreak of civil wars allowed Al-Qaeda space and opportunities to expand. Bin Laden had been [musing on renaming](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/bin-laden-documents-alqaida-struggle)
 Al-Qaeda before his death, and in the post-Arab Spring phase the group half-heartedly did this, using the name “Ansar al-Shari’a” in many places. In Yemen, AQAP [made three attempts](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/)
 to create local emirates: shorter-lived efforts in 2011 and 2013, and—after the [coup by the IRGC’s Huthis and their rapid jihad](https://eeradicalization.com/becoming-ansar-allah-islamic-revolution-yemen-oved-lobel/)
 conquered vast swathes of the country—a more successful effort for a year in 2015-16 in Mukalla that ended effectively in withdrawal, rather than defeat. Al-Qaeda embedded in Libya after Qaddafi, notoriously murdering the U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi in September 2012, and was concurrently occupying northern Mali, from which it was removed by French intervention in early 2013. In Somalia, Al-Shabab’s fortunes have waxed and waned, but the group remains powerful in the southern and rural zones, while intermittently challenging the nominal State in its one area of serious control, the capital Mogadishu. These statelet projects in the first half of 2010s built to some extent on what had happened in Iraq a decade earlier, and in some places, notably Mali, repeated some of the same mistakes—failing, as AQIM’s then-emir [Abd al-Malek Drukdel](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2020/06/11/france-kill-drukdel-aqim/)
 (Abu Musab Abd al-Wadud) put it in [a letter to his theatre commander](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/en-jihadi-rivalry-2.pdf)
, to realise that the population was like a “baby … in its first days” that needed “support … until it stands”, not the application of shari’a with “extreme speed”, which will “engender hatred towards the mujahideen”.

Zarqawi’s Islamic State movement had been sponsored by Al-Qaeda since its creation in 1999, significantly driven by **Muhammad Saladin Zaydan (Sayf al-Adel)**, a then-senior Bin Laden deputy and Al-Qaeda’s military chief after Atef’s demise. Sayf’s thinking was conditioned in 1999 by intra-jihadist rivalries in Afghanistan. After 9/11, it was Sayf—by then based in Iran, where he still is—who led the effort to merge Al-Qaeda’s and Zarqawi’s strategic visions. Zarqawi, who received his own [direct assistance from the Iranians](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/zarqawi-profile-to-2004-al-qaeda-jihadism-iraq)
 ahead of his arrival in Saddam’s Baghdad in May 2002, never overtly broke his arrangement with Al-Qaeda before his death in June 2006. Indeed, Zarqawi finally gave _bay’a_ to Bin Laden in October 2004 and formally took on the Al-Qaeda name.

That said, even Zarqawi had cross-words with Al-Qaeda’s leadership—Al-Zawahiri wrote him a [famously reproving letter](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/harmony-program/zawahiris-letter-to-zarqawi-original-language-2/)
 that was intercepted in 2005—and Zarqawi’s successors almost immediately moved relations into [a state of willed ambiguity](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
, where they remained for eight years, before the contest over jihadist visions for Syria led to a catastrophic rupture in 2014. The [crucial point is](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/zarqawi-profile-to-2004-al-qaeda-jihadism-iraq)
 that analysis goes wrong if it sees the Islamic State as an Al-Qaeda “offshoot”: what happened in 2014 was “not a schism in the sense of two entities emerging from common foundations; it was the inevitable unravelling of an attempt, made in contingent circumstances, to merge two distinct and incompatible strategic visions.”

I wrote [a lengthy report recently on Al-Qaeda’s strategic evolution](https://eeradicalization.com/al-qaeda-global-terrorism-report-kyle-orton/)
, which is heavily impacted by its interaction with the Islamic State, so I won’t reiterate all of that here. The only additional point to highlight is that if one has to pin down a fork in the road where the IS-Qaeda collaboration became untenable, it was not 2013-14 in Syria, but 2007-08 in Iraq: “Where Bin Laden had seen IS’s setback \[in the Surge and Awakening\] as evidence their strategy was defective, IS had [come to the reverse conclusion](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/the-islamic-states-strategic-plan)
: there had been tactical errors, especially with the tribes, but the essentials of their theological-strategic vision were correct, and with adjustments they could recover and prevail; \[with the declaration of the ‘caliphate’\] they had their proof. As IS saw it, having been left for dead in 2007-08, they were able to revive by keeping their ideology pure and then do what all other Islamists claim to want to do.” A similar ideological divergence has taken hold in assessing the destruction of the “caliphate” in 2019: Al-Qaeda believes to have tried and failed makes it more difficult to convince people to try again; IS says it shows it is possible.

Under Al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda’s separation from the Islamic State movement was made absolute, and there is now no way back. Al-Zawahiri, building off some of the last things Bin Laden was writing, even [leaned-in to some of the accusations](https://eeradicalization.com/al-qaeda-global-terrorism-report-kyle-orton/)
 the Zarqawists levelled at him, particularly about Al-Qaeda’s “populist” turn, its view that jihad cannot succeed without a mass audience. IS, of course, will have no part of holding the implementation of the Holy Law hostage to a plebiscite. The competition between Al-Qaeda and the Zarqawists has shaped the jihadist movement over the last decade, and will surely be important for some time to come, though the question remains of how long Al-Qaeda can remain in the competition.

**AL-ZAWAHIRI’S DOWNFALL AND AL-QAEDA NOW**


---------------------------------------------

Al-Zawahiri’s demise, six decades after he joined the jihad and a quarter-century after he became one of America’s most wanted men, was suitably dramatic—in itself and in its implications.

Just [after 6 AM](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62400923)
 that Sunday morning a year ago, having done his morning prayers, Al-Zawahiri stepped out onto the balcony of a villa in the Sherpur area of Kabul that had been [appropriated from](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/hey-thats-my-house-us-aid-worker-realises-zawahiri-villa-is-his-old-home)
 one of the American aid workers forced to flee Afghanistan when President Biden [gave the country back](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/bidens-enduring-afghanistan-debacle)
 to Pakistan’s jihadists in August 2021. Al-Zawahiri was being watched by an American drone and moments later the Al-Qaeda leader was shredded by two Hellfire R9Xs, missiles that use rapidly rotating blades instead of explosives to minimise unintentional casualties.[54](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-54-135614300)
 Biden, in his [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/)
 announcing Al-Zawahiri’s killing, drew attention to the blood on Al-Zawahiri’s hands and quite rightly added: “justice has been delivered”.

The most immediate question was who would replace Al-Zawahiri and one year later we are still waiting for an answer to _that_ question. **Al-Qaeda has not formally announced Al-Zawahiri’s replacement**, and there are [several possibilities](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/reduced-but-rebuilding-united-nations)
, though it is widely believed **Sayf al-Adel** has the role.[55](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-55-135614300)
 Sayf would continue the localisation of Al-Qaeda and its aversion to direct terrorism in the West, having never wanted to go down that path in the first place (Sayf was [among the internal opponents](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86743/1/Gohel_Deciphering%20Al-Qaeda_2018.pdf)
 of the 9/11 attacks). But Sayf might well try to step up regional terrorism, or at least might well find himself being directed to escalate on that front. When Sayf began his present stay in Iran in 2002, as a guest of the thankfully-late [Qassem Sulaymani](https://eeradicalization.com/the-middle-east-after-qassem-sulaymani/)
, his relationship with the clerical regime and its spy-terrorist commander was already old.[56](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-56-135614300)
 Sayf had, for example, been one the Al-Qaeda jihadists [on the Iranian training program](https://kyleorton1991.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/u-s-district-court-ruling-2011-11-28-iran-hizballah-involvement-in-1998-embassy-attacks.pdf)
 that enabled the East Africa Embassy bombings in 1998, and it was Sayf, while in Iran, who [relayed the orders](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10576100802291568)
—from Al-Zawahiri, notably—to begin the terrorist campaign in Saudi Arabia in the early 2000s. At this stage there is no doubt that Sayf is a creature of the IRGC; there have been chances to leave, [taken by some of Sayf’s comrades](https://twitter.com/KyleWOrton/status/1566036131275227137)
, but he never has. Iran has exerted [considerable influence](https://eeradicalization.com/death-and-consequences-for-al-qaedas-leadership/)
 over Al-Qaeda for decades and Sayf’s ascension would be the culmination of that. Which would be Sayf’s primary problem: Al-Qaeda’s operatives and sympathisers have gotten used to rationalising the relationship with Iran;[57](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-57-135614300)
 having the Iranians so overtly running the show is a different matter.[58](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-58-135614300)
 The operational benefits of having a terrorist regime behind Sayf are obvious, but the political consequences [within the jihadist world](https://anbajassim.com/2022/08/30/%d8%aa%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b5%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b6%d8%a9-%d9%84%d8%aa%d9%88%d9%84%d9%8a-%d8%b3%d9%8a%d9%81-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%af/)
 are negative, whether it is morale within Al-Qaeda or the group’s ability to compete with the Islamic State for the “undecideds”.

It is an open question how much impact Sayf or anyone else as emir _can_ have on Al-Qaeda’s fortunes, even if he brings further Iranian support to the role. Al-Zawahiri was a notoriously awful, charisma-less speaker, which certainly matters when Al-Qaeda’s leader is significantly involved in setting strategic direction and tone.[59](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-59-135614300)
 Some argue this visible failure has obscured [Al-Zawahiri’s quieter successes](https://www.jihadica.com/zawahiri-is-not-the-loser-people-think-he-is/)
, notably keeping the organisation cohesive after the Islamic State challenge. There is likely something to this,[60](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-60-135614300)
 even if Al-Zawahiri was not the [effective micromanager Bin Laden was](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/books/review/the-rise-and-fall-of-osama-bin-laden-peter-bergen.html)
 right down to the end. While it is not clear whether Sayf would be better at the propaganda side of the work, he does seem to be skilled in bureaucracy and strategy. The problem is, Sayf is inheriting an organisation that is struggling on most metrics and in ways that will not easily be patched up. The decentralisation, for example, has weakened the Centre’s influence, but has not compartmentalised the theatres very well from the contagion of failure: [whatever is going on in Syria](https://eeradicalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EER-Report-Al-Qaeda-and-Global-Terrorism-Kyle-Orton.pdf#page=21)
, the jihadists are restricted to a besieged corner of the country; things are not good in Yemen; the competition with the Islamic State in Africa grinds on. Still, Afghanistan could yet revive the group’s fortunes; paradoxically, Al-Zawahiri being killed in Kabul is a serious sign of life for Al-Qaeda.

Probably the most important implication of Al-Zawahiri being killed in the Taliban’s capital is that it [eliminates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taliban-ties-with-al-qaeda-endure-as-terrorist-leader-killed-by-u-s-in-afghan-capital-11659482149)
 all the silly arguments about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda being separable. Where one goes, the other follows, because they are not, in fact, meaningfully distinct organisations but a part of a single jihadist network, sharing an ideology, resources, and ultimately a command structure that runs through Aabpara.[61](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-61-135614300)
 To crystalise this point, Al-Zawahiri was in a house [owned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62393618)
 and [protected](https://twitter.com/FrudBezhan/status/1554432905899909121)
 by Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is the “interior minister” of the Taliban’s emirate and the declared overall deputy of the Taliban. Sirajuddin is also a [senior Al-Qaeda member](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
,[62](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-62-135614300)
 and the well-trained unit within the Taliban that Siraj directly oversees, the “Haqqani Network”, is [particularly](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-15026909)
 [close](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/world/asia/mullen-asserts-pakistani-role-in-attack-on-us-embassy.html)
 to [the ISI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-cia-attack-idUSKCN0XB2VM)
, which means Pakistan’s military-intelligence establishment knew where Al-Qaeda’s leader was and tried to shield him from America—_again_.[63](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-63-135614300)

It is in part to avoid these implications for the Taliban/Pakistan that no admission has been put out under Al-Qaeda’s name that Al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul. Hours after the strike, the [Taliban condemned it](https://jihadology.net/2022/08/01/new-statement-from-the-islamic-emirate-of-afghanistans-dhabi%e1%b8%a5-allah-mujahid-regarding-the-drone-attack-in-kabul-city/)
, hilariously as a violation of the “Doha Agreement”. The Doha “deal” did not have many concrete terms—its main purpose was to cover the U.S. withdrawal—but in so many words it frowned on harbouring Al-Qaeda’s emir. Anyway, [reporting from earlier this year](https://www.thedailybeast.com/al-qaeda-is-planning-to-fake-the-death-of-ayman-al-zawahiri-its-dead-leader)
 indicated that the Taliban wanted to get out of this awkward situation by muzzling Al-Qaeda—the attempt to hold a public funeral was apparently shut down—and then announcing at some point that Al-Zawahiri has died of natural causes, definitely not in Afghanistan. To this hour, the Taliban are [issuing direct denials](https://www.voanews.com/a/7193513.html)
 that Al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul. It is difficult to believe anybody is actually fooled by this, but it is possible the U.S. and others in Europe will go along with this for political reasons, both to save their own face about what they have already done and to pave the way for the “engagement” with the Taliban that some of them think is necessary.

Biden’s supporters and the [usual suspects](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/08/01/al-zawahiri-killing-shows-over-the-horizon-counterterrorism-can-work/)
 tried to make political hay out of Al-Zawahiri’s killing, claiming it as a victory for the “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism “strategy”. Doubtless this narrative had some traction. Cynics might wonder if the timing of this strike—given that Al-Zawahiri was [tracked down](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-02/joe-biden-to-speak-al-qaeda-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri/101290492)
 six [months earlier](https://twitter.com/abdsayedd/status/1554386396516732930)
—was not meant to dampen the criticism on the first anniversary of Biden abandoning Afghanistan. If so, it pretty much worked. The success on the political front, however, does not erase the analytical questions from those of us who regard this [“over-the-rainbow” concept](https://www.axios.com/2021/09/12/afghanistan-counterterrorism-over-horizon-biden)
 askance. The full weight of the American Imperium being able to find and neutralise one long-time nemesis [does not even begin to suggest](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/can-the-west-keep-track-of-the-threat)
 that the U.S. has good visibility into the dynamics within Afghanistan that are fostering emerging threats. All we know for now is that the jihadist movement and Islamists more broadly have been buoyed by the fall of Afghanistan, and that Al-Qaeda is in places Biden said it would not be.[64](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-64-135614300)

Bin Laden had been moved to create the Masada camp after the humiliating fiasco at Zhawar in April 1986, which disclosed how badly organised and incapable the Arab-Afghan fighters were. In April 1987, the Arab-Afghans endured what might most accurately be described as a less-bad defeat at the battle at Jaji: the Mujahideen (just about) held off one of the Soviet “retreating offensive” incursions, but the Arabs got mauled and forced to retreat. Still, it wasn’t quite the decimation of a year earlier, and Bin Laden—who personally fought at Jaji—ascribed the improvement, naturally, to the training at Masada. In casting the Arabs at Jaji as partaking in glorious victory, Bin Laden was helped by the daily dispatches of Jamal Khashoggi, and Bin Laden’s star was born in the Arab world. It was this moment in the spring of 1987 that Mustafa Hamid identifies as “the main cause of Al-Qaeda’s emergence as a separate organisation, and its rapid growth.” Hamid adds that Bin Laden’s money also played a significant role, since most other factions were broke by this point. See: Mustafa Hamid and Leah Farrall (2015), _The Arabs at War in Afghanistan_, p. 111.

The Egyptians closest to Bin Laden seem to have been: [Ali Amin al-Rashidi](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/al-qaedas-first-military-emir/)
 (Abu Ubayda al-Panjshiri), [Muhammad Atef](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/profile-of-a-9-11-planner-muhammad-atef/)
 (Abu Hafs al-Masri), and Sayyed Imam al-Sharif (Dr. Fadl)—rather than Al-Zawahiri. Al-Sharif was close to Al-Zawahiri, though neither of them were major figures in the Arab-Afghan population. The narrative that “evil Egyptians” led Bin Laden astray in the late 1980s might have partly originated in a post-9/11 effort by Azzam’s partisans and/or the Saudi government to rewrite the history to make themselves look better. The main aspect, however, seems to be some Western authors and journalists having “overdramatized the intrigues in Peshawar”, where there really was “bad blood between Abdallah Azzam and some of the Egyptians”. _The Caravan_, pp. 359-61.

[16](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-anchor-16-135614300)

Azzam, though not a member of Al-Qaeda, was “not a very active opponent”: he largely did not understand what it was and where it was going, but his tendency to avoid intra-Muslim conflict meant Azzam generally did not oppose developments within the Arab-Afghan population, and was not displeased at the special forces-like capacity Al-Qaeda was providing to the Arab-Afghans \[_The Caravan_, p. 361\]. Minutes from a meeting in August 1988 are sometimes held up as the founding of Al-Qaeda. What those minutes actually show is Al-Qaeda as a pre-existing organisation, and an effort to poach from Azzam’s cadre—albeit subtly, since one of Azzam’s key lieutenants, Tamim al-Adnani, was present \[_The Arabs at War in Afghanistan_, pp. 108-12\]. In other words, Bin Laden was competing with Azzam, even if Azzam was not aware of it.

The exact timeline of Bin Laden’s arrival in Sudan is somewhat contested. The 9/11 Commission Report simply says: “Bin Ladin moved to Sudan in 1991”. Other sources than the link cited above give the arrival date as December 1991, for example, _A History of Modern Sudan_ (2008), by Robert Collins (p. 196), which describes Bin Laden being received “enthusiastically” by Al-Turabi. There are claims for other dates, both later (January 1992 seems to be quite a common one) and earlier—Dwight Hamilton and Kostas Rimsa claim (p. 94) in, _Terror Threat: International and Homegrown Terrorists and Their Threat to Canada_ (2007), that Bin Laden was “fully established” in Sudan by mid-September 1991—but the sourcing for these is less credible.

 Al-Banna was behind the confusion over Al-Badawi’s real identity, convincing Al-Badawi to adopt the _kunya_ “Abu Ayyub al-Masri”. By all accounts, Al-Banna and Al-Badawi were close socially as well as ideologically and organisationally, having [run Al-Qaeda’s operations together](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 for two years, from 1996 to 1998, and Al-Banna’s devotion to Al-Zawahiri appears absolute. Al-Banna (and Al-Badawi) were appointed leaders in Yemen [by Al-Zawahiri](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 in the 1990s, and in 2006 Al-Banna unhesitatingly stepped down as emir from what was not-yet called AQAP to make way for Nasir al-Wuhayshi after he had been freed in one of those Yemeni jailbreaks. Al-Banna [worked in Yemen](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)

, also an EIJ veteran, who accompanied the good doctor on the 1995 Russia trip and was a major jihadist figure in his own right. [Another of AQAP’s accounts](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/an-al-qaeda-commander-comes-out-from-the-shadows.php)
 tells of Al-Banna having been imprisoned in the late 1980s with another EIJ operative, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid (Saeed al-Masri), who had served time earlier in the 1980s, presumably simultaneous with if not alongside Al-Zawahiri, as part of the post-Sadat crackdown. Al-Yazid was Al-Qaeda’s financial emir at the time of 9/11 and rose to be number three in the organisation by about 2007, [appointed](https://www.bbc.com/news/10206180)

 (Abu Ali al-Anbari), the de facto deputy of what was then-AQM, when Al-Qaduli travelled—via Iran—to Pakistan in February 2006, four months before Al-Qaduli was captured in Iraq. And even after IS formally dissolved its Al-Qaeda ties, Al-Yazid was [involved in sending](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/05/03/al-qaeda-provides-evidence-isis-was-its-iraqi-branch-calls-for-it-to-return/)
 instructions to the group’s leaders in Iraq to tell them to desist from certain “political gaffes”. A [number](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2017/11/21/al-qaeda-instructs-the-islamic-states-predecessor-not-to-attack-iran/)

The 9/11 Commission Report (p. 532) notes that KSM claimed Al-Zawahiri was opposed to the 9/11 attacks, imploring Bin Laden to adhere to Taliban emir Mullah Muhammad Umar’s injunction after the Embassy bombings against using Afghanistan as a base to attack the U.S., but “other detainees” said Al-Zawahiri was “squarely behind” Bin Laden, which seems to be the truth. It is possible KSM was trying to exclude other jihadists from “credit” for the “Planes Operation”.

The first use of the “ninja missile” was in Syria, in February 2017, to kill Al-Zawahiri’s then-deputy, [Abu al-Khayr](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2017/02/27/al-qaedas-deputy-killed-in-syria/)
. At the time, those of us watching Syria knew that something was different about the strike—Abu al-Khayr’s car was still intact, except for a section of roof on one side—and then it happened several more times. It [took two years](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secret-u-s-missile-aims-to-kill-only-terrorists-not-nearby-civilians-11557403411)

That said, Ansaru—the Al-Qaeda faction in Nigeria—did go out of its way to [issue a statement](https://jamestown.org/program/islamic-state-propaganda-renews-focus-on-africa-but-a-jihadist-monopoly-remains-elusive/)
 defending Sayf, specifically from the charges of being an Iranian puppet, about three weeks before Al-Zawahiri was killed.

[58](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-anchor-58-135614300)

The other most obvious candidate after Sayf is **Muhammad Abbatay (Abd al-Rahman al-Maghrebi)**, Al-Zawahiri’s son-in-law, who is also in Iran. **Yasin al-Suri**, another serious contended, is in Iran, too.

Gregg Carlstrom, the Middle East correspondent at _The_ _Economist_, [memorably tweeted](https://twitter.com/glcarlstrom/status/1554219194127990788)
: “Zawahiri will be best remembered for transforming al-Qaeda from a feared terrorist franchise into a really boring podcast”.

: “\[Al-Zawahiri\] used his authority across Al-Qaeda’s global network of regional affiliates and followers to provide strategic direction and continually urging attacks on the United States and reinforcing the prioritization of the United States as Al-Qaeda’s primary enemy. … He built an organizational model that allowed him to lead the global network, even from relative isolation. And he was one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of \[status\] significance”.

On 29 July 2022, Siraj gave an [interview to an Indian outlet](https://www.news18.com/news/world/exclusive-afghanistan-needs-indias-help-desperately-to-secure-peaceful-environment-taliban-interior-minister-haqqani-5670295.html)
 saying: “Al-Qaeda … has no presence in Afghanistan and is no more of a threat and the world should not feel threatened about the already dead outfit.” It’s obviously amusing enough given Al-Zawahiri being killed in Kabul two days later, and more so once it is understood that Siraj is also a member of Al-Qaeda and was speaking from Afghanistan.

Carlotta Gall’s _The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014_ goes as far as one can on the present evidence in describing Pakistan’s concealment of Bin Laden up to 2011. Whether ever detail transpires to be true on that specific issue, it is an excellent description of the shameful situation the West got into in Afghanistan, paying Pakistan to pretend to help us, as it barely concealed the fact it orchestrated the jihadist mayhem that killed our soldiers and thousands of Afghan civilians. In terms of last year, the White House spokesman was asked whether Pakistan had been warned about the drone heading for Al-Zawahiri, and [pointedly responded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/08/02/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-nsc-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-august-2-2022/)
, “There were no notifications in advance”. Any such notification to Pakistan would have led to Al-Qaeda’s leader being tipped off.

[64](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-anchor-64-135614300)

Biden made a [strange statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/30/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-administrations-student-debt-relief-program/)
 (even stranger if you see the video) on 30 June: “Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said Al-Qaeda would not be there. I said it wouldn’t be there. I said we’d get help from the Taliban. What’s happening now? What’s going on? Read your press. I was right.” The “help from the Taliban” line was particularly odd, since Biden had needed to order the strike on Al-Zawahiri precisely because the Taliban were _not_ helping against Al-Qaeda, and were in fact harbouring its leader in their capital. In the year since, the evidence has piled up all in the same direction. The U.N. Monitoring Team report in June painted an alarming picture of what the ISI network is doing in Afghanistan—and makes clear that it is all components of that network: “The link between the Taliban and both Al-Qaida and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) \[the ‘Pakistani Taliban’\] remains strong and symbiotic. A range of terrorist groups have greater freedom of manoeuvre under the Taliban … They are making good use of this, and the threat of terrorism is rising in both Afghanistan and the region”. Etc. Etc. A decent summary of the report is [available here](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/un-warns-of-risk-of-terrorism-from-afghanistan/)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:26>) appears in multiple sources related to the killing of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022. The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/)) and News18.com ([https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html](https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html)) both use the image to illustrate the building that was hit.

The News18.com article also mentions the CIA's monitoring of al-Zawahiri and the use of Hellfire missiles in the strike. Kyle Orton's article ([https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad)) also uses the image and mentions the location of the strike in the Sherpur area of Kabul. The image is also accompanied by other images (<image:7051>, <image:7068>, <image:7069>, <image:7070>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Cambodia': 0.35, 'Pakistan': 0.1, 'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Ghana': 0.07, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'China': 0.05, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'Albania': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Laos': 0.02}

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results show the quote attributed to Anthony Bourdain in social media posts and images. However, the search for the quote's authenticity and origin did not yield any definitive results. Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined based on the available evidence.

The decision option that best applies is `false` because there is not enough evidence to verify the claim.

Greta Thunberg was seen with a placard that read "Stand with Gaza"

**New Delhi:**

Climate activist Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza has drawn a sharp response from Israel. On Friday, Greta posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, in which four activists, including herself, held placards expressing solidarity with Palestine and Gaza.

Reacting to Ms Thunberg's post, Israel, through its official X handle, took a dig at the climate activist saying that Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets, "which have butchered innocent Israelis".

"The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up,” the post added

Israel also used pictures of three 19-year-old Israelis, who were killed allegedly in a Hamas attack.

The response came after Ms Thunberg, in her post, was seen with a placard that read, "Stand with Gaza."

Another activist called for a "Free Palestine," while two other women held placards with messages, "This Jew supports Palestine" and "Climate justice now!"

“Week 270. Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected,” Greta Thunberg wrote in the caption.

Some users, however, came to Ms Thunberg's defense. They pointed out that her expression of support was for Gaza, not necessarily for Hamas. One user wrote, “Your subconscious and true ideals leaked. She said Gaza, not Hamas. This says a lot. good luck editing this next.”

Another person accused Israel of “playing the victim card.”

A user accused Israel of similar actions and brought up concerns about the environmental sustainability of the air and watercraft used by the IDF in the context of restricting movement and impacting Palestinians in the region. “The air and watercrafts used by the IDF to restrict movement and BUTCHER innocent Palestinians in the largest open-air prison for 75 years aren't made of sustainable materials,” read the comment.

Ms Thunberg's statement came 270 weeks after she initiated her Friday school strike, which later ignited the global school strikes movement.

The United Nations revealed that in just 10 days, around 4,200 people have lost their lives and more than a million people have been forced to leave their homes due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Greta Thunberg — from climate warrior to Israel hater

Greta Thunberg brought millions out onto the world’s streets to protest for a greener future. Demonstrating against companies polluting the planet in a variety of countries, she was arrested multiple times. Since Hamas’ brutal October 7 terrorist attack, the Swedish activist has redirected much of her rage toward Israel.

She wears a keffiyeh, poses with Palestinian flags and accuses Israel of "genocide," while largely ignoring Qatar, which, for years, has been transferring to Hamas funds derived from its oil and natural gas sales profits. Paradoxically, burning these fuels emits greenhouse gases, a contributing factor to global warming - the very issue Thunberg has been protesting for years.

At demonstrations, she calls to "Free Palestine," stop arming Israel and impose a permanent ceasefire on the country. She rarely, if ever, demands the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza or condemns the terrorist attack that triggered the war.

Demonstrating against Israel being her first priority, Thunberg didn’t even bother attending either the 2023 climate conference held in Dubai or that of 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The climate activist has turned her back on her supporters, and alongside her relentless anti-Israel campaigning, has also sparked anger in other arenas.

Thunberg visited Turkey’s Kurdish regions last November, evoking outrage in the country for condemning Erdogan’s government. She criticized the environmental destruction in Kurdish-populated areas. "Destruction and exploitation of nature – such as unlawful forest cutdowns, sacrificing zones for mining companies and fires – is one of the many tools used as part of the continuous attacks against the Kurds. This often leads to devastation of local communities and biodiversity as well as forced displacement."

On an X posting, she then called on Turkey to amend its treatment of the Kurds. "Turkey must clarify its stance on the Kurds and other minority groups by enshrining their rights in the constitution." She went on to write, "The government continues to use ‘terrorism’ as a pretext to silence its political opponents. Tens of thousands of politically active individuals remain imprisoned without fair trials. International organizations such as the ECHR, UN, and Amnesty have condemned this and called for their release. For a sustainable peace and a just future, the Kurds’ right to freedom and autonomy must be respected and the violent attacks against Kurdistan must end."

After causing ire in Turkey, she moved on to voice her support for independence for Western Sahara, provoking fury in Morocco. She posed with the Western Sahara flag, championing the region’s struggle for justice and human rights. She said it was unacceptable for the international community to ignore the situation in Western Sahara and called for global action toward a just resolution.

This too is a political struggle, in no way related to climate issues. She’s also condemned the Azerbaijani government, accusing it of "ethnic cleansing" and further crimes against Armenians, and has protested against Georgia’s government, advocating "Justice, freedom and democracy," amid the country’s political crisis.

And if you’d thought Thunberg had given up on her anti-Israel activism, you’d be wrong. She continues posting images of Palestinian flags and protest signs in support of Gazans from her weekly demonstrations in Stockholm. Last month, she returned to Denmark, where she took part in a violent protest against the Maersk shipping company.

Along with further anti-Israel activists, Thunberg disrupted activity at the company’s headquarters, claiming it was using its ships to transport weapons to Israel. She called on the company to cancel all contracts and investments related to what she termed "Genocide and occupation of Palestine." Thunberg was arrested along with around two dozen more protesters who were all released shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, she regularly shares anti-Israel messages urging her 14 million Instagram followers, and millions more on other social media platforms, to demonstrate and take action against Israel.

Thunberg is the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and opera singer Malena Ernman who represented Sweden in Eurovision 2009. At age 15, in the summer of 2018, Greta started a one-woman protest outside the Swedish parliament. She would show up every Friday with a small sign reading, "Skolstrejk för klimatet" (School Strike for Climate) She was slowly but surely joined by more teenagers and, in time, mobilized masses worldwide to take to the streets to protest the climate crisis. She met with numerous world leaders and took part in demonstrations across the globe.

Her protest peaked the following September with millions of young people flooding the streets of major cities worldwide and staging climate marches. Thunberg led hundreds of thousands in a climate demonstration in New York City, making the journey to America by solar-powered boat, averting the greenhouse gas emissions of a transatlantic flight.

That same month, Thunberg even expressed solidarity with Israel, tweeting a photo of climate supporters in Tel Aviv - only to be met with backlash. Despite talk backers angrily asking, "How dare you?”, she left up the posting.

Greta Thunberg on the cover of Time Magazine

Thunberg was named Time Magazine's 2019 Person of the Year. Then - and current - US President Donald Trump, whom Thunberg had stared down at the UN building in New York, mocked her, tweeting, "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"

Thunberg has even received several Nobel Peace Prize nominations for her climate activism. The committee went for other candidates.

Israeli social media users also expressed their indignation, arguing that her statements essentially amounted to support for Hamas. One user, "@hasolidit," remarked: "Autistic children were murdered by Hamas and singled out as legitimate military targets solely because they were Israeli Jews. Your failure to even acknowledge that is proof of your rabid antisemitism. Not your stupid stuffed animal," referring to a toy octopus appearing in one of Thunberg’s posts, interpreted by some as an antisemitic symbol.

Thunberg didn’t stop at anti-Israel posts, but rather brought her anti-Israel activism to her weekly protests outside the Swedish parliament. Three weeks following the massacre, the Swedish activist stood alongside anti-Israel placards declaring, "Free Palestine," and, "Stop the Holocaust," and she herself held a sign reading, "Justice for Palestine."

> Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change

Criticism of Thunberg has also emerged on the global stage with Fridays for Future (FFF) leaders in Germany, Austria, and even in her homeland of Sweden, distancing themselves from her October 20 post featuring signs supporting the Palestinians, while ignoring the Hamas massacre. Israeli teens have also lashed out at Thunberg, turning her from a role model to a resented figure.

Thunberg’s controversial stance has meant the global climate movement, which had enjoyed widespread consensus support, has found itself divided around a conflict many of its advocates don’t understand, and certainly has nothing to do with environmentalism.

Thunberg has become fixated on the Palestinian issue. At rallies, rather than talking about global warming, the climate crisis, pollution killing millions every year, or countries (such as Iran, Iraq, and Qatar) still producing oil, she has repeatedly spoken out against Israel.

At a rally in Amsterdam November 2023, a man approached her on stage and said that he had come to an environmental, not political, event. The man was forcibly removed from the stage as Thunberg declared to the crowd, "No climate justice on occupied land."

Palestinian flags were waved in the crowd and Thunberg was spotted donning a keffiyeh. In an effort to clarify her stance, she said, “As a climate justice movement, we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and for justice. Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity.” She, again, in no way addressed the Hamas terrorist attack that sparked the war. Why? Maybe, it was convenient for her to overlook the murderous attack so as to stand alongside Gazan civilians, some of whom, as it turns out, assisted the terrorists, hiding hostages in their homes or concealing weapons and terrorists.

Amsterdam wasn’t the end of it. Thunberg continued her scathing anti-Israel rhetoric, undoubtedly to the delight of Tehran, Doha, and Hamas leaders in hiding. At a pro-Palestinian in Stockholm in November 2023, she called to "Crush Zionism."

Throughout this time, she carried on wearing a keffiyeh around her neck, posing with anti-Israel protest signs and Palestinian flags and accusing Israel of "genocide" in Gaza. In Malmo, Sweden, last May, she showed up at the Eurovision Song Contest, an event officially defined as non-political. Here, she took part in a protest and was arrested for disturbing the peace. Photos from the scene showed her, with a keffiyeh wrapped around her neck, being dragged away by two police officers. At this demonstration, Palestinian flags were waved and slogans were chanted against Israel and then President Joe Biden. She was arrested once more a few months later, this time in Copenhagen, again at an anti-Israel rally,

Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change. The young woman who once drew millions globally against corporations polluting the environment and fought for a better future has now abandoned the cause she spearheaded. Her role has shifted from that of a leader enjoying global consensus to a divisive figure, ignoring the crimes of Hamas terrorists who raped, murdered and kidnapped Israelis on October 7.

The past 18 months have witnessed almost no large-scale demonstrations against climate change, but rather modest protests numbering in the dozens or hundreds. Trump is back in the White House and, unlike during his previous term of office, when climate activists under Thunberg’s leadership were taking to the streets en masse, the U.S. president’s anti-environment measures are passing rather quietly as world leaders are acting slowly if at all. And it looks like no one can lead the global climate protest like the old Greta Thunberg could.

Greta stands with Gaza
======================

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E)

Greta Thunberg's 'stand with Gaza' is a historic moment for the global climate movement.

> .

Greta Thunberg posted the picture below on her X account during a week of climate and peace protests in London recently. Many people in the press criticised her because they themselves supported the Israeli bombing and opposed a ceasefire. 

_Medical Aid for Palestinians is responding to the current emergency in Gaza. It has launched an emergency appeal to 'ensure that Palestinian health workers have the medical resources they need, as soon as possible'. You can donate to the appeal_ [_online_](https://www.map.org.uk/donate/donation-details/484)
_._ 

Some of those people called her, ludicrously, antisemitic, because a toy octopus appeared in the first image she used. There was also criticism from some climate activists in Germany, Austria and Israel. Beyond that, there was little open criticism from the climate movement, and much support on social media.

This is a historic moment for the global climate movement. This article explains why. The photo reminded us of Martin Luther King’s speech on the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on 4 April 1967. 

**Questions**

King had maintained a public silence on the war for the two years after President Johnson sent 500,000 troops to Vietnam. Now he broke that silence to call for peace and American withdrawal.

_Nancy and Jonathan have recently published_ Why Men? A Global History of Violence and Inequality _(Hurst, 2023)._ [_Order a copy now_](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/why-men/)
_._

Many of his advisers, and many liberals had urged him not to speak out, saying that it would split the civil rights movement and turn President Johnson’s government against them.

King went ahead. In an eloquent and closely argued speech, he said that he had been urging nonviolence on young African Americans rioters. They had replied to him with a question: What about Vietnam?  

"Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today—my own government.

"For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent."

**Greatest**

King’s courage strengthened opposition to the war, particularly among Black Americans, and especially among Black American soldiers. But the effect of his words went far wider as well.

King also told the truth – the war was racist. And it was the same racism that characterised American society. And by telling the truth King saved his own integrity.

Greta's speaking style is very different from King’s. He was the greatest rhetorical speaker in America in the twentieth century. He reached for the strongest effects, for metaphors and the rolling rhythms of Southern preachers and gospel music.

Greta is a master of plain speech. Her longest speeches are short, clear and passionate. Her X posts are compact, honest, devastating. And in this picture there are only twelve words. But together they carry a complex argument.

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/greta-gaza-2%20%281%29_0.jpg)

Each face tells a story, and each tells a different story.

**Radical**

Look again at the four young women. Greta holds a sign that says “Stand With Gaza”. Because she is instantly recognizable, the most important leader in the climate movement, this carries a message: The whole climate movement should support Palestine. 

It’s a call for change. And she is choosing her words carefully: Stand With Gaza. Not peace, not ceasefire - though she supports both. 

But no, solidarity is the starting point. Behind her another young woman holds two words: ‘Climate Justice Now’. She is saying this is about climate. And this is about justice. 

As with King, we cannot talk about climate justice if we do not support the most important issue of social justice in the world right now. A third woman holds two words: “Free Palestine”.

They are written on a piece of paper, or cardboard, on which someone has painted the colours of the Palestinian flag. Again, that means peace, but far more. This is an intervention on the radical side of the issue.

**Moral**

The fourth woman has five words: “This Jew Stands With Palestine.” Our solidarity is not antisemitism. Take a moment to look at those expressions again.

This picture, these four women, are a response to a moral imperative. This is a response to a unfolding great atrocity. That is the most important matter here, and that is enough. But this solidarity is also historically important for the climate movement. Here is why.

This is a change. All through the days of the mass school strikes, Greta insisted that the movement had to be non-political. For example, she refused to support a Green New Deal because it would split the movement. She did not then comment on matters beyond climate.

This made sense to her, as it made sense to many people in the climate movement. And on some level, she may still have hoped against hope for action by the politicians. Then two things happened. 

First, in October 2019 Thunberg called for adults to join the school students on strike. She said that if they did not, the students could not win. Large numbers of trade unionists did strike in Germany and Australia, but nowhere else.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion was clear. Greater power was needed. Only a global movement for social justice in all its forms could deliver that. The other conclusion was that the leaders of the world would not act. Form the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021 she sent two tweets that condensed the argument. 

One was “Blah, blah, blah. F\*\*\* you.” The other was “Uproot the system”. Gaza matters because of seventy-five years of suffering, and because human beings, children, women and men are dying there in great numbers.

But those are not the only reasons why so many people have marched in solidarity in so many countries. This is also a great public racist massacre. This is the racism of centuries of white supremacy made murderous flesh again.

People know this, all over the world. It is why African Americans and people of colour are so central to the marches in the United States, and why all the thirteen representatives in the US Congress who have called for a ceasefire are people of colour.

Most people in Africa, Asia and Latin America know this too. But so do many, many white people in Europe and North America. So do people in the Middle East, acutely, in their guts, enraged and in sorrow. And so, as we have seen, do many Jewish people in New York, Washington and Tel Aviv.

**Future**

This is why the movement has been so enormous. We want to rid the world of racism and we are saying every human matters. The scale of these movements has frightened the governments of the world. That is why the secretary general of the United Nations and most of the governments of the world have called for a ceasefire.

This is where the future of Palestine, the future of the climate movement and the future of humanity come together. For one thing, climate change will bring us many massacres like Gaza's, many punishments of refugee camps. 

Runaway climate change will cover the world with walls, camps, barbed wire, hungry refugees and government massacres. The fight against such a future starts now. But there’s more. Pakistan has at least housed many refugees for decades. 

Almost all of Europe is far worse, and there hatred of refugees fuels racism and a turn to the far right. But also, we know by now that we cannot stop climate change without a massive, committed climate movement across the world, willing to take power to save us all.  

We cannot do that without the active support of the majority of workers and peasants in Africa, Latin America and Asia. There are many reasons. The people in the poorer countries of the Global South are 80 per cent of humanity. 

**Horror**

Back in 2019 those countries already produced 62 per cent of global fossil fuel emissions. Soon enough they will produce two-thirds. That means we cannot stop climate change unless the people in those countries insist upon an economy that brings them a decent standard of living through renewable energy.

Moreover, the great social movements of the last hundred century strongest, and most important in the countries of the Global South. After all, that is where people have suffered most. 

And since the Arab Spring, and all the great movements against dictatorship, the social movements have again been strongest in the South. And the impact, the horror, of climate change will be worst in the South. 

The movements in Europe and North America still matter. We write this in England, and Thunberg made that photo in Sweden. And people in the South will not stop climate change if the North refuses to do so. 

**Turning**

We are all in this together. But what happens in the South will matter more. That is why standing with Gaza against racism matters for the future of the climate movement. But there is another link. To stand with Gaza is to stand with life against death. 

To stand against climate change is to do the same on a far larger scale. This photo, just a photo, is a moment in human history. By contrast, Gaza is the most important issue in the world right now. 

But this is also a turning point in the climate movement. There will be many more horrors. We are embarked on the mother of all struggles to save each other and all living things. 

There will be many more such moments, and some of them will be even worse. But the direction of change for the climate movement is becoming clear. Like the signs say: stand with Gaza - climate justice now!.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

American airline JetBlue on Sunday announced it is changing its [onboard maps](https://www.ynetnews.com/travel/article/skawilphc)
 on all carriers, to comply with U.S. guidelines for the Middle East, after Israel was labeled there as "Palestinian Territories."

In a message to Ynet, the company said its mission and values are that customers feel welcome and safe onboard. "We’re sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region and we were not previously aware of the issue."

JetBlue map of the Middle East marks Israel as Palestinian Territories

After the public outrage expressed over the maps displayed on board JetBlue flights, the company said that the map app was provided to the airline by a third-party company, which they license from a specialty technology company.

"After a careful review, we have decided to switch to a new map vendor. While our content provider works on making this transition, we have also asked the current vendor to adjust our onboard map so that it aligns with the U.S. government’s map guidance for the region. We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows."

The removal of Israel from the map angered a Jewish passenger who called out the airline but that was not the first time JetBlue was called out for possible anti-Israel bias. [In April](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry844wwz0)
, a Jewish passenger was ousted from a flight after complaining about a flight attendant wearing a "Free Palestine" pin on his uniform.

JetBlue apologized to the passenger and announced that it would change its policy.

"We hope with these actions we can welcome him back onto a JetBlue flight in the future," the company said, at the time.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Times of Israel discusses DNA tests in Israel, which suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. The provided URLs also discuss DNA testing in the context of Jewish identity and the Law of Return, further implying that DNA testing is a legal practice, although potentially subject to specific regulations or controversies.

The evidence does not explicitly state that DNA testing is illegal.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images of Donald Trump and mentions articles published on July 25, 2024, related to Israel. However, none of the provided sources contain the alleged quote from the Claim.

The search results do not provide any information about an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, nor do they contain the specific statement attributed to Trump.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
. The Iran-backed political party and militant group holds Israel responsible for the [strikes that killed at least 29 persons and injured around 2,800 people](/en/lebanon-explosions-stoke-fear-of-hezbollah-retaliation/a-70261978)
.

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim:** "An iPhone was also blown up in Lebanon", [a social media user wrote on X](https://archive.ph/yYA3i "External link — a social media user wrote on X")
 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a destroyed iphone is not related to the current attacks in LebanonImage: X

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")
we find both images: [The image on the left](https://perma.cc/6TAZ-EPZ9 "External link — The image on the left")
, showing burning solar panels, dating back to[an X-post](https://x.com/FSRI_org/status/1215631166226817024 "External link — an X-post")
 from February 2020. In the post, the US-American Fire Safety Research Institute shared an article about the safety of photovoltaic systems along with the image.

The second photo shows a burning house [dates back to December 2020](https://www.saobserver.net/news/update-westside-home-fire-a-total-loss-not-suspicious-3723448 "External link — dates back to December 2020")
. The fire incident took place in Canada and not in Lebanon.

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

If you want to know more about how the explosions in Lebanon happened technically, DW Science explains it [in this article](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

![cs_opinion_img](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2020'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of the exploded iPhone (<image:31>) is featured in multiple articles discussing explosions in Lebanon. One article from DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061)) fact-checks the claim, stating the image is old and unrelated to the September 2024 attacks. Another article from ITC.ua ([https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/](https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/)) discusses explosions targeting electronic devices, including iPhones, and includes the image (<image:343>).

The China Academy ([https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/](https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/)) also uses the image (<image:31>) in an article about the "pager attack," claiming it caused a trust crisis among Chinese consumers.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The evidence suggests that the image could be from Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation data. The image search results confirm that there has been destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim is from Gaza or that it was taken in December 2024.

To verify the claim, I would need to confirm the exact location and date the image was taken.

The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:33>)
geolocate(<image:33>)
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14230>). NPR also contains an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14231>). Al Jazeera published aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (<image:14232>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could be from Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation data. The image search results confirm that there has been destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim is from Gaza or that it was taken in December 2024.

To verify the claim, I would need to confirm the exact location and date the image was taken.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why
=============================================================

Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation

Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away.

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. “When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,” he explained.

However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. “This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,” Dr. Rosenberg added.

The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions.

In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity.

“There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,” explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. “The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.”

“When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,” explained Dr. Rosenberg. “At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea.

"As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.”

Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. “For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,” he said.

“This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,” he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image's metadata indicates it was taken by Mahmud Hams. The reverse image search did not provide any additional information to verify the claim.

The claim states the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. Without further information, it is impossible to verify the claim.

I need more information to verify the claim, such as the location of the image and the context of the event.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:35> This image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:35>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

## Elaboration
The image's metadata indicates it was taken by Mahmud Hams. The reverse image search did not provide any additional information to verify the claim.

The claim states the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. Without further information, it is impossible to verify the claim.

I need more information to verify the claim, such as the location of the image and the context of the event.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli attack Lebanon October 21 2024")
geolocate(<image:35>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 21, 2024, about the US seeking an end to the war in Lebanon, including an image <image:1948>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.66, 'Israel': 0.22, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.08, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search revealed an article from Al Jazeera on October 21, 2024, discussing the US seeking an end to the war in Lebanon. The geolocate function suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

The claim states the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon. The evidence suggests the image might be from Palestine, not Lebanon. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip.

Source of the claim

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

The photo was posted on Fliker by an account named [Tanya Knigh on 25/12/2006, and was explained as showing two mummified Spanish children from the 19th century at the Mint Museum in Potosi, Bolivia.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smurfie77/333238377?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaf-NowrYSPdQib6AwuqOgbujlriQwuln3oY-zG75oLRNBKRISpoXJq0vayn1A_aem_WdbZCYRlh2m7hO3aQi4zFQ)

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

ראש המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל עמית סופר: "עוד בית שניזוק באביבים. היישוב חטף עד כה עשרות טילים מסוגים שונים והנזקים לרכוש הם בהיקפים גדולים ומשמעותיים כך גם יישובים סמוכים. כל מתקפה כזו משפיעה על כל היישובים שלא פונו. אני מקווה שמינוי הפרויקטור ייבשר את הזרמת התקציבים והמענים הכה דחופים בצפון"

The sources contain images of destruction in Gaza (<image:14270>, <image:14271>, <image:14272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.25, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.16, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'Malta': 0.12, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.08, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Italy': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results confirm that there was Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. The image search also shows destruction in Gaza. The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date (March 2025) or the number of casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the date and the number of casualties.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:39>)
image_search("Israeli bombardment Deir al-Balah Gaza March 2025")
geolocate(<image:39>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:39>

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about the Israeli military in Deir al-Balah, Gaza ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/middleeast/israel-military-deir-al-balah-gaza-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/middleeast/israel-military-deir-al-balah-gaza-intl)). The Guardian published an image of a building explosion in Gaza ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/21/gaza-israel-war-latest-situation-updates-live-news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/21/gaza-israel-war-latest-situation-updates-live-news)). Al Jazeera contains an image of destruction in Gaza ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)).

The sources contain images of destruction in Gaza (<image:14270>, <image:14271>, <image:14272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.25, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.16, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'Malta': 0.12, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.08, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Italy': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The image search results confirm that there was Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. The image search also shows destruction in Gaza. The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date (March 2025) or the number of casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the date and the number of casualties.

Content: Al Jazeera published an article with images of Israeli bombings in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. <image:14274>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that there have been Israeli bombings in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. However, the provided evidence does not specify the exact date or the number of casualties related to the image.

Therefore, the claim remains partially supported. The date and the number of casualties still need to be verified.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts the aftermath of a bombing in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, which is consistent with the claim. However, the exact date (March 2025) and the number of casualties (at least four Palestinians) are not confirmed by the available evidence.

الصحفي محمد العويد

##### الصحفي محمد العويد ابن محافظة درعا، يتحدث لدرعا 24 عن تحديات وآفاق الإعلام السوري: نحو بناء إعلام حر ومستقل في مرحلة ما بعد النظام

**يشهد الإعلام السوري اليوم مرحلة مفصلية بعد سقوط النظام الذي أحكم قبضته على الصحافة ومؤسساتها لعقود طويلة**، ولا سيما خلال السنوات الثلاث عشرة الأخيرة. ومع هذا التحوّل، انفتح الباب أمام أفقٍ جديدٍ يطمح إليه الصحفيون والمؤسسات الإعلامية في سوريا، لتمكين العمل الإعلامي الحر والمستقل. ومع ذلك، فإن الطريق نحو تنظيم هذا القطاع وضمان حرية التعبير لا يزال مليئاً بالتحديات.

في هذا السياق **أجرت شبكة درعا 24 مقابلةً خاصّة مع الصحفي [محمد العويد](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002329474787)
 من أبناء محافظة درعا**، للحديث عن هذا المشهد والكثير من الأمور المتعلقة به وتحديات وأولويات العمل الإعلامي في هذه المرحلة. يتناول الحوار قضايا مثل واقع الاتحادات التي أُنشئت مؤخرًا، وظروف الناشطين والصحفيين في البلاد، وأداء الحكومة في الجانب الإعلامي، والدور الذي يجب أن تضطلع به المؤسسات الصحفية لدعم التحول الإعلامي في سوريا.

**ينحدر الصحفي محمد العويد، من بلدة معربة في الريف الشرقي من محافظة درعا.** وهو خريج جامعة دمشق قسم الصحافة. عمل مديراً لفرع وكالة سانا في درعا، وفي صحف سورية أخرى قبل اندلاع الثورة في 2011. وعمل بعدها في تلفزيون “سوريا الشعب” الذي أُنشئ في عمّان في الأردن، حيث كان يقيم هناك. بعدها في تلفزيون “18 آذار” للمعارضة السورية. وفي عام 2014، هاجر إلى فرنسا. عمل من هناك مع تلفزيون “أورينت” كمراسل، وكذلك في موقع “زمان الوصل”. كما تعاون مع “تلفزيون سوريا”. وحالياً، ينشر مقالاته في عدد من المواقع الإلكترونية بصفة مستقلة، وليست دائمة.

كيف تُقيّم المشهد الإعلامي في سوريا اليوم بعد سقوط النظام الذي كان يُحكم قبضته بشكل كبير على الإعلام الرسمي وكل وسائل الإعلام في مناطق سيطرته؟ وما هي الآفاق التي تتطلع إليها من الإعلام السوري في المستقبل؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المشهد الإعلامي يعني – مرحليّاً – خلال هذه المرحلة لا يمكن تقييمه بالأدوات الطبيعية المعتادة؛ لأن الكل يشعرون أن هذه المرحلة هي مرحلة انتقالية، مرحلة تأتي بعد انهيار نظام الأسد وهروبه، وحل أكبر مؤسسات الدولة الأمنية والعسكرية. وبالتالي، **حالة الحرية – إذا جاز التعبير – في أوجها، في ذروتها، بدون أي ضوابط، بدون أي قواعد، في حالة من عدم المسؤولية الإعلامية.** لأن هناك سعة أفقية في انتشار الشائعات والمصادر غير المسؤولة، وعدم التأكد من الأخبار في حالة متناقضة بالقدر الذي نرى فيه الوجه الإعلامي الإيجابي من الحريات التي سادت في سوريا بعد فترة كبت طالت أكثر من عقود، نرى أيضاً غياب أدوات الدولة أو مؤسساتها التي يفترض أن تكون هي المصدر الرئيسي لفهم هذه التحولات، أو المصدر الرئيسي للأخبار التي تخاطب الناس أو تكون مصدراً للمعلومات منها.

كيف يمكن بناء إعلام يتمتع بالحرية في سوريا؟ وما هي التحديات التي تعيق تحقيق ذلك في المرحلة القادمة؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بتقديري، أولاً، يفترض أن يتحمل الجميع المسؤولية كشارع، كصحفيين، كنخب سياسية، وأن تكون على قدر المسؤولية. لأن المرحلة لها خصوصيتها، وثانياً، الشكل الطبيعي أن تبادر الناس، أن تبادر هذه القوى المجتمعية في الإعلام والسياسة إلى إعادة ترتيب أوراقها، إعادة ترتيب أولوياتها. وأن تكون إذا لم تكن الشراكة متاحة الآن مع أدوات الدولة أو سلطة الدولة، فلتكن في الجهة المقابلة. لكن تقديري أنها تحتاج بعض الوقت، لأنه الأسباب الموضوعية لغياب هذه الكتل التي يفترض أن تكون صلب أو مقومات الحريات الإعلامية، إن واقع المعارضة بعد العام 2011 لم يكن خاضعاً بالمعنى الحقيقي لبنية المؤسسات. وإذا شاءت ووجدت مؤسسة، فهي تحكم جمهورها السوري المنتشر في أصقاع العالم، في كل دول العالم. **فالآليات التي كانت سائدة خلال فترة المعارضة وإعلامها هي أقرب لمرحلة الفوضى وليس التنظيم**، لأنه أنت لا تحكم في جغرافية محددة، أنت توجّه خطاباً، وردّ هذا الخطاب من الجمهور لا تخضع لأي قواعد.

الآن الفرصة الاستثنائية هي أنه **أصبح للسوريين وطن وجغرافيا يمكن الالتزام بقواعدها وآلياتها،** كما هو في بقية البلدان، بدءًا من الجوار السوري في الأردن أو الشمال التركي، وصولًا إلى دول العالم الآخر. فبتقديري أنه **يجب أن نكون صريحين مع أنفسنا وتتحمل هذه القوى الجديدة مسؤولياتها وأولوياتها وواجباتها ووظيفتها**، من خلال أولاً تنظيم صفوفها، ومن خلال أن تكون هي الرافع الحقيقي للحريات. ولا نعول وننتظر حتى تمنحنا السلطة الحريات على طبق من ذهب.

ما هي الأولويات العاجلة التي يجب على المؤسسات الإعلامية والجهات الفاعلة تحقيقها لضمان حرية الصحافة في سوريا الجديدة؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن ترتيب هذه الأولويات سيكون مرهوناً بوجه السلطة القادمة. على الأقل خلال شهر آذار، سيتم إعلان تشكيل الحكومة، ومن المفترض أن يصدر عن هذا التشكيل لاحقاً – بالتوازي مع المؤتمر الوطني – البيان الدستوري. كما يُفترض أن يصدر معه بعض التعاميم أو القرارات التي تُحدد وتشرح وتؤطر مجموعة القوانين الناظمة للحياة السياسية والإعلامية. لأنه بدون هذا الجانب السياسي أولاً، لا يمكن للقوى السياسية أن تعمل.

بمعنى آخر، في الجانب الإعلامي، ما هي الأطر التي أعمل كصحفي بموجبها؟ هذه الأمور غير واضحة حالياً، لأنه ليس لدي أُطر ولا قوانين، والأمور متروكة الآن. لكن ا**لعاجل، بتقديري، هو أن تتولى القوى السياسية، ومن ضمنها القوى المدنية في الجانب الإعلامي، المسؤولية وأن تتهيأ لهذا الدور**. يجب أن تكون هذه القوى جاهزة، وأن تكون قادرة على ضم كوادرها والاستعداد للمرحلة القادمة. إذا لم تكن المؤسسات الإعلامية متاحة حالياً، فعلى الأقل في المرحلة القادمة، **يجب أن تكون هذه المؤسسات جاهزة إلى جانب المعارضة، وأن يكون لديها خطابها وبنودها التي ستطلبها من السلطة وتتناقش معها حولها،** سواء ما يتعلق بالإعلام أو بحريات الصحافة أو بالقانون الإلكتروني. كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن تبادر الجهات المدنية والصحفيين والنخبة الثقافية إلى تهيئة أوراقها، حتى تكون جاهزة في المرحلة القادمة.

**أعتقد أن أبرز تحدي حالياً هو تأخر السلطة السياسية في إعلان موقفها، على الأقل إعلامياً**. ما هي الأجواء التي ينبغي على الصحافة أن تعمل بموجبها. هل تترك بهذا الشكل غير المنضبط، ولكن في حدود معقولة؟ أم نعود إلى حالة من التنظيم؟ لأن أهم ما في الإعلام – إذا جاز التعبير بين هلالين – هو “لعبة المُشاكسة” مع الحكومة، وكل مُشاكسة تستوجب أن يكون هناك قواعد ضبط بين الطرفين. **للأسف، حتى الآن، غير واضح تماماً ما هي القواعد بين الطرفين. هل هو دستور 2012؟ هل هو قانون المطبوعات السوري؟** يبدو أن الأمور تُركت بهذا الشكل.

**لذلك، أعتقد أن أول الأولويات التي يجب أن تكون حاضرة وهو أن تتهيأ الأطراف المدنية لتلعب هذا الدور، وأن تكون على الأقل جاهزة فيما إذا ذهبت السلطة السياسية إلى اعتماد قانون ما. يجب أن يكون لديها النموذج المقنع والحضور الجماهيري.**

كيف يمكن للإعلام أن يساهم في بناء مستقبل سوريا الجديد؟ وما هو الدور الذي يجب أن تلعبه الحكومة لدعم هذا التوجه؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

جزء من وظيفة الإعلام دوماً أن يلعب دوراً محورياً في أي مجتمع، سواء في سوريا أو غيرها. وبالتأكيد، في الحالة السورية، هذا الدور مُضاعف بسبب الظروف الاستثنائية التي تمر بها البلاد. **في المجتمعات المستقرة، عادةً ما يلعب الإعلام دوراً ضمن قواعد السوق، حيث يكون الدافع هو السبق الصحفي، الشهرة، التسريبات، والعناوين المغرية** التي تجذب الجمهور وتزيد من انتشار المؤسسات الصحفية. هذه الممارسات تعتبر جزءاً من لعبة “العرض والطلب” في السوق الإعلامي.

لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً. **أحد التحديات الرئيسية هو أن الإعلام يجب أن يضع القيمة الأخلاقية في أولوية عمله – أي خبر قد يخلق بلبلة كبيرة في المجتمع السوري -، خاصةً أن بنية الدولة ما زالت هشة وغير مستقرة.** لذلك، أعتقد أن سلم الأولويات في الحالة السورية يجب أن يختلف قليلاً، وأن يُراعى في الحالة السورية **أن تكون الأولوية للبناء وليس فقط للممارسات الإعلامية التي نراها في المجتمعات المستقرة**، والتي لديها باع طويل في تحمّل أعراف الصحافة الجديدة وحقها في السوق. في الحالة السورية، الوضع يحتاج من الإعلامي أن يرتب أولوياته بشكل مختلف، مع **التركيز بشكل خاص على الأولويات الأخلاقية للمهنة.** يجب أن يكون المقياس الأخلاقي والحالة الوطنية، أي: هل تتحمل الناس هذه الأنشطة الصحفية؟ التي عادةً ما تكون حق للصحفي.

بالتالي، لا بأس بتقديري من تعزيز هذه التوصيفات والبنية الأخلاقية في الصحافة، على الأقل مرحلياً، حتى يستقيم بنيان المجتمع السوري وتعود الصحافة إلى دورها الطبيعي.

ما تقييمك للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة الجديدة فيما يتعلق بالإعلام؟ وكيف يمكن للإعلام أن يلعب دوراً رقابياً على أداء الحكومة في هذه المرحلة؟ وهل تتقبل الحكومة هذا الدور؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بالنسبة للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة، **حتى الآن لم تتخذ خطوات حقيقية**. ما نراه هو الطبيعي. بعد تحرير دمشق، حيث أن دمشق بأهميتها، التي تعتبر مأساة القرن، نحن أمام مشهد بالغ الأهمية من الطبيعي أن يستقطب كل الإعلام العالمي والمؤسسات الإعلامية. **أعتقد أن الإدارة المؤقتة ربما سهلت – إذا جاز التعبير – أو تعاطت مع الأمر بإيجابية، لأنها تريد إيصال رسالة مفادها أن هذه المرحلة تختلف عن مرحلة الأسد، التي كانت تتطلب الموافقات الأمنية وزيارات الفروع الأمنية،** وكانت هناك محدودية في قدرة الصحف والمؤسسات على العمل بحرية.

**الإدارة الجديدة قدمت رسالة سياسية أكثر من كونها إعلامية**، لأن الناس في الإعلام تنتظر بنية إعلامية وقانونية واضحة حتى تستطيع أن تستمر، وحتى تعرف ما هي الأرضية الصلبة التي تقف عليها. هذا الأمر ضروري حتى تستطيع أن تلعب دورها الرقابي على الإعلام، وهذا هو المطلوب. لكن موقف الحكومة حتى الآن – وهذا نعزوه للظرف الذي تمر به الإدارة الجديدة، وهي مرحلة انتقالية أو حتى ما قبل الانتقالية – لأنها استلمت بلداً ينوء من الخراب في كل هياكله، بما فيها الهياكل الإعلامية.

**سواء قبلت الحكومة الدور الرقابي للإعلام أم لم تقبله، فاعتقد أنه إذا استطاعت القوى الإعلامية والمنظمات الصحفية وكتلة الصحفيين والمثقفين أن تكون جاهزة ومنظمة لهذا الدور**، فسيقوم الإعلام بأداء دوره الرقابي بشكل طبيعي، ولكن ضمن الأطر والشروط التي سيتم الاتفاق عليها في المرحلة القادمة.

ما هي أبرز الأولويات التي يجب على الإعلاميين السوريين التركيز عليها خلال الفترة الانتقالية؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بالأولويات، أعتقد أنه من الصعب أن أكون جزءاً من الحالة الصحفية وفي نفس الوقت أطالب بإنهاء حالة الفردية وتعزيز القيم الأخلاقية لمهنة الصحافة. أفهم أن الأمر ليس سهلاً، لأن الصحفي يعيش كما الشاعر ليقول فيها للناس: “ها أنا هنا كصحفي، لدي سبق، لدي تحقيق، لدي… إلخ”. لكن الحالة السورية، بما أنها حالة وطنية استثنائية، تستوجب سلم من الأولويات مختلفة قليلاً.

بدلاً من أن تكون الأولوية لدي كصحفي أو كمؤسسة إعلامية هي السبق الصحفي، يجب أن تكون الأولوية للقيمة الأخلاقية والمسؤولية الوطنية (كما أسلفت). هذا لا يعني إنهاء دوري كصحفي، بل يعني الانتقال من الحالة الفردية إلى حالة من المشاورة والتعاون مع زملائي في العمل ومع المؤسسة الإعلامية التي أنتمي إليها، ومؤسستي لديها تشبيك مع مؤسسات أخرى، وبالتالي نعيد ترتيب الأولويات بما يتناسب مع خصوصية الحالة السورية.

وهذا يعزز الدور المؤسساتي للإعلام ويعطي صورة أفضل من الصورة السابقة. قبل 13 سنة، **كنا نعيش حالة فردية، بل وحتى حالة فصائلية في الإعلام. الآن، نحن أمام حالة وطنية تستوجب الدقة والتعاون مع الآخرين أكثر من أي وقت مضى**. هذه الحالة تستوجب التركيز على القيم العليا، وأولها القيمة الوطنية وقيمة المواطنة والحريات. كل هذا يتطلب تخفيف حالة التفرد والذاتية التي نمارسها عادةً كصحفيين.

ما هو رأيك بالأفكار التي تدعو لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام – أسوةً بكثير من دول العالم – كخطوة لدعم حرية الصحافة؟ وهل تعتقد أن هناك بدائل أفضل لتنظيم القطاع الإعلامي؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

في قضية **الدعوة لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام، أعتقد أن هذا الطرح مبكرٌ جداً، خصوصاً في الحالة السورية**. صعوبة الأسئلة المطروحة اليوم، سواء كانت إعلامية أو سياسية أو دينية، وكل البرامج المقدمة، لا تراعي بشكل كافٍ الحالة الاستثنائية التي تمر بها سوريا. إذا نظرنا إلى دولة مستقرة مثل المملكة الأردنية، يمكن أن يثار نقاش حول إلغاء وزارة الإعلام، لأن هناك بنى مدنية ومؤسساتية قائمة منذ أكثر من خمسين سنة. لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً.

**يجب أن نفهم خصوصية الحالة السورية البالغة الحساسية. القوى القادمة من المعارضة، والتي ستُدير البلد بشكل أو بآخر، لم تكن منضبطة خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية**. كانت هذه القوى مشتتة. لكن لأول مرة الجغرافيا السورية ستتعامل معها ضمن أطر قانونية. أنا في فرنسا، ملتزم بقانون الإعلام الفرنسي، لكني لست ملتزماً بالقانون التركي. الآن، في سوريا، أصبحت ملتزماً بالحالة السورية ككل. لأول مرة، تتاح فرصة لأن يكون المرسل والمستقبل في جغرافية واحدة تحكمها القواعد نفسها. هذا يحتاج إلى تأطير وإنهاء المرحلة السابقة التي كانت قائمة على الفوضى وعدم الانضباط.

ليس هناك قانون يحكم العلاقة بين تلفزيون سوريا في تركيا (الذي يعمل في المنطقة الحرة ولا يخضع للقوانين التركية) وبين جمهوره في أمريكا أو لبنان أو الأردن أو حتى داخل سوريا. الآن، لأول مرة، يفترض أن تتاح لعبة إعلامية مهمة جداً، حيث **يلتزم كل من المرسل والمستقبل بقواعد تندرج تحت قانون الإعلام السوري والقانون العام السوري بضوابطه وقواعده وتعريفاته**. هذا يحتاج إلى جهد كبير حتى نعتاد عليه.

في المراحل القادمة، بعد استقرار الدولة، **إذا رأى أهل التشريع أن البلد لم تعد بحاجة إلى وزارة الإعلام، فليكن ذلك. أنا مع دعاة توسيع مجال الحرية بلا حدود أمام المؤسسات الإعلامية، لكن في الحالة السورية، أقف وأشعر بالخوف. هذه الحالة هي أكثر الحالات التي تستوجب الضبط والقوننة، وليس العكس.**

كيف ترى الخطوات التي تُتخذ اليوم التي تهدف لتوحيد الإعلاميين والصحفيين في عدة مناطق في سوريا وتأسيس اتحادات؟ هل ترى أن هذا يساهم في توحيد الخطاب الإعلامي وتنظيم العمل، أم أنها قد تؤدي إلى تهديد حرية التعبير وطمس التنوع الإعلامي؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

مسألة توحيد الإعلاميين وتأسيس اتحادات، الأصل في ذلك أنه مباح والضروري والمهم، **لكنني شخصياً متخوف من جملة المشهد الإعلامي ومعطيات المشهد السياسي**. عادةً، في بلاد الشتات، اعتدنا أن أي مجموعة تعمل اتحاداً، وهذا الاتحاد يشابه – للأسف – الحالة السياسية أو أي حالة أخرى من التجمعات السورية. السبب في ذلك هو إنّه لم يكن لدينا “بيت” بالمعنى الحقيقي، فكنا نلجأ إلى وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي والتعميمات المفتوحة، مع غياب القواعد الحقيقية.

**الخوف الآن هو من الاستسهال في المشهد السوري. بمعنى أنه غداً أو بعده، سنرى اتحادات صحفية في كل محافظة، وفي العاصمة دمشق، ستظهر اتحادات بأسماء متعددة**. المشكلة أن هذه الاتحادات، للأسف، هي استمرار للحالة السابقة، واستمرار للحالة التي كانت قائمة في الشتات. 

وهنا لا أريد أن يفهم كلامي كهجوم على أحد من زملائنا، **لكني أرى أن الإشكالية الحقيقية هي أننا نحاول صناعة “نمور من ورق” مجدداً، في حين أن الفرصة اليوم متاحة في دمشق لصناعة “نمور حقيقية”**.

بمعنى أن الراغبين في العمل السياسي والإعلامي، إصبح لدينا الآن وطن وبيت يمكننا اللقاء فيه، ولم نعد بحاجة إلى الأساليب القديمة التي تركت آثاراً سلبية. هذه فرصة حقيقية لبناء اتحادات قائمة على قواعد واضحة وفهم مشترك للآليات والدوافع.

النقطة الأهم هي أننا الآن أمام بيت، لكن الواجبات كثيرة. يجب أن نبدأ بتأثيث هذا البيت، تجميله، وتقديمه للجمهور. هل كل من في هذا البيت متوافق معك على الرؤية والقواعد والشروط والأولويات؟ من فهمي، أرى أن إشكالية الاتحادات التي تعلن عن نفسها بشكل متسارع تشبه إلى حد كبير القوى السياسية. ربما هذا بسبب خصوصية المرحلة، أو الظروف الراهنة، أو الرغبة في المشاركة، وهذا كله صحيح. لكن شخصياً، **أميل إلى أن قواعد وآليات تأسيس الاتحادات والروابط يجب أن تكون مختلفة عما يجري على أرض الواقع. لأنه لأول مرة سنكون أمام بُنى ستعتمد على ذاتها، وليس على دعم أو رعاية من هنا أو من هناك**. هذا البيت يجب أن يعتمد على اشتراكات الأعضاء. **هل الأعضاء في الحالة السورية جاهزون لهذا؟** أتمنى ذلك. هل الأعضاء سيكونون في حالة من الانضباط المؤسسي؟ أتمنى ذلك أيضاً.

بمعنى أن الاتحاد بهيكليته سيكون صاحب الموقف، وليس كل عضو بمفرده. الاتحاد سيكون ممثلاً للأعضاء، وهذه الجزئية لم نعتد عليها خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية، حيث كانت الاتحادات التي نشأت عبارة عن صفحات تواصل اجتماعي، وبالتالي كانت أدوات ضبط الأعضاء غير ممكنة، فكيف تضبط أنا في فرنسا والآخر في تركيا والثالث في أمريكا والرابع في سوريا. الفرصة الآن هي أن أصبح هناك بيت يجمع الجميع، وهي فرصة تاريخية. لكن يجب أن نبادر كصحفيين إلى استثمار أقصى طاقاتنا في هذا الجانب.

ما أبرز التحديات التي تواجه الصحفيين في درعا في المرحلة الحالية، وكيف يمكن للإعلام المحلي أن يساهم في إيصال صوت المجتمعات المحلية للحكومة وللعالم؟ وما هو مستقبل العمل الصحفي في درعا وسوريا؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بوضع درعا، هي جزء من الكل السوري. إذا استطاعت درعا أن تواكب الحالة الإعلامية السورية العامة، فهذا أمر جيد ويُحسب لها. بالتأكيد، أ**ي إعلام محلي يساهم في وصول صوت جمهوره أو المجتمع المحلي الذي يحاول أن يكون صوته.**

التحديات في درعا تشبه التحديات في المشهد الإعلامي السوري ككل. مرة أخرى، نحن أمام لحظة فارقة: أصبح لديك بيت بعد أن كان أعضاء هذا البيت، من الأب إلى الأبناء، مشتتين في كل أنحاء العالم. ولأول مرة، يستوجب بناء هذا البيت حضور الجميع ومشاركة الجميع. لكن يبدو أن ثمة ظروفاً أو معيقات ستكون عائقاً أمام اكتمال هذه العائلة. هذه المشكلة تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في درعا، كما تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في عموم سوريا.

بمعنى، ماذا عن الزملاء الآخرين؟ هل سيعودون؟ هذا غير واضح. وماذا عن المؤسسات القائمة وكوادرها؟ ما هي الخيارات ؟ هذا أيضاً غير واضح. وماذا عن النشطاء الذين هم جزء كبير من المشهد الإعلامي السوري اليوم؟ حملوا أرواحهم على أيديهم وضحوا، ولدينا تضحيات جسيمة، نقف أمامها بإجلال. لكنه سؤال مرّ يحتاج إلى وضوح وإجابة: **ماذا تفعل أمام كتلة لا يستهان بها من الشباب من النشطاء الإعلاميين؟ ما هي الخيارات؟ هل تقول لهم “كفيتم ووفيتم”؟ بالتأكيد، هذا لا يستقيم. يجب أن نستفيد من تجربتهم، أولاً هذا حقهم أن يكونوا جزءاً من المشهد القادم، لكن ضمن أي شروط؟ ضمن أي معطيات؟**

كل هذه الأسئلة تشكل تحديات كبيرة تحتاج إلى إجابات. وأنا بتقديري أن الأهم هو أن تكون هذه المجموعة أو هؤلاء الصحفيين هم من يثيروا هذه الأسئلة، وهم من يعبر عن أدواتهم، ويعرفوا عن هويتهم. كل هذه الأسئلة يفترض أن يصوغوها هم، بمساعدة الآخرين، بمساعدة زملائهم السابقين، وبالتشبيك بين بعضهم. لكن عليهم هم أن يثيروا هذه الأسئلة.

ما هي رسالة محمد العويد للصحفيين في درعا؟ وكيف يمكنهم أن يكونوا أكثر فاعلية في المشهد؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المهم جداً هو أن يعمل كل ناشط، كل مواطن صحفي، وكل مهتم بالشأن الإعلامي في المحافظة، ويبادر بالتشبيك مع الآخرين من زملائه. **المهم الآن هو أن يفهم الجميع أن الأصوات الفردية لن يكون لها جدوى في المرحلة القادمة**، حتى لو كان مشهور أو ذو باع طويل لن يحقق شيئاً، لأن الأصوات الفردية لن تكون ذات جدوى أمام هذا المشهد بالغ التطور والمتسارع، والذي يعاد بناؤه في سوريا.

المشروع بهذا الحجم، على مستوى الوطن السوري، يحتاج بالمقابل إلى أن يكون هناك روافد أو أجنحة، وليس حالات فردية. **أنا من دعاة الحالة الجماعية في هذا المعنى. للصحفيين في درعا، وللمهتمين بالشأن الإعلامي**، أن تكون الدعوة دائمة إلى لقاءات دائمة على مدار الشهر أو الأسبوع، يتم فيها طرح هذه الأسئلة، تبدأ من الهوية: من نحن؟ ماذا ينتظرنا؟ ما هي حقوقنا؟ كيف نعمل؟ ما هي مصلحتنا؟ أن نشبك مع بعضنا البعض؟ هل نعمل كأفراد؟ كل هذه الأسئلة واستحقاقاتها مهمة، وأعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك محاولات للحصول على أجوبة لها، وليس أن تبقى مجرد أسئلة في الفضاء المفتوح. لأن التحديات كبيرة، والحقوق كثيرة. بدلاً من الحالة الفردية، التي من مشاكلها أنها تقبل أحياناً باللا شيء (مثلاً، أن تكون مراسلاً في درعا لمؤسسة في دمشق وأن يُقبل)، لكن بالحالة الجمعية أن يسأل ويكون خلفه مؤسسة أو مجموعة تسأل ما هي حقوقه.

يجب أن نعي أن المرحلة القادمة، حتى في حالة المواطن الصحفي، لم يعد من المقبول التطوع. العمل الإعلامي يجب أن ينتهي بهذه الطريقة. **العمل الإعلامي هو عمل يومي، مضني، إشكالي، بجوانبه المتعددة قانوني، وأحياناً يضعك في مواجهة السلطة أو الشارع.** كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن يكون ما يحميها، بدءاً من الجانب التعويض المالي وصولاً إلى الحقوق داخل المؤسسة التي تعمل بها.

لذلك، أنا أميل إلى ضرورة الحالة الجمعية بين الناس والتكاتف فيما بينها، وإثارة كل هذه الأسئلة. في المشهد السابق، **هناك متطوعون، وشهدنا مئات وعشرات الشهداء الذين لا نعرف الآن من هي المؤسسات أو الجهات التي ستعنى بهم أو بعوائلهم أو بأبنائهم**. مرحلة الاستقرار في سوريا اليوم تختلف. إذا كنت مواطناً صحفياً، يجب أن تسأل أولاً: ما هي حقوقي لدى المؤسسة التي أتعامل معها أو التي أتطوع لأجلها؟ هذا أبسط الأسئلة. لم يعد المشهد كما في السابق، حيث كنا نعتمد على العفوية أو النخوة. الآن، انتقلنا إلى مرحلة المأسسة. المأسسة تختلف، لأنك تتعامل مع مؤسسة، وأولى الأشياء التي يجب أن تُطرح هي: ما هي حقوقي؟ ما هي واجباتي؟ ماذا عليّ؟ وماذا لكم؟ هذه الأسئلة تريح الطرفين وتساعد على بناء علاقة مستقرة وطويلة الأمد.

**من وجهة نظري، يفترض أن يتعاون الجميع في هذه المرحلة. هذه واحدة من التحديات، وربما أهمها.**

قصف إسرائيلي على أهداف سورية - صورة أرشيقية من موقع المرصد السوري

أعلنت وزارة الدفاع السورية تفاصيل العدوان الجوي الذي شنته قوات الاحتلال، اليوم السبت، على العاصمة دمشق.

وقالت وزارة الدفاع السورية، في ما نشرته على لسان مصدر عسكري عبر صفحتها الرسمية على موقع فيسبوك، أنه في «حوالي الساعة 1:35 من فجر اليوم السبت، نفذ العدو الإسرائيلي عدوانا جويا من اتجاه الجولان السوري المحتل مستهدفا بعض النقاط في محيط مدينة دمشق».

وأضاف المصدر: «تصدت وسائط دفاعنا الجوي لصواريخ العدوان وأسقطت معظمها، واقتصرت الخسائر على الماديات».

بيان وزارة الدفاع السورية

وفي وقت سابق، اليوم السبت، ذكرت وسائل الإعلام الرسمية السورية أن إسرائيل شنت هجوما جويا على محيط العاصمة السورية دمشق.

كما أفادت وسائل الإعلام السورية بسماع دوي انفجارات متتالية في دمشق.

وذكر موقع روسيا اليوم أن الدفاعات الجوية السورية نجحت في التصدى لأهداف معادية في أجواء محيط العاصمة دمشق، موضحا أن الانفجارات القوية بدأت في الساعة 01:35 بتوقيت دمشق، مشيرا إلى أنها استمرت دقائق عدة.

#### **غزة تواجه الإبادة**

ولليوم الـ57، يواصل الاحتلال عدوانه على قطاع غزة الذي بدأ في السابع من أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، بعد قيام المقاومة الفلسطينية بتنفيذ عملية طوفان الأقصى، بمنطقة غلاف غزة، وبعد انتهاء الهدنة الإنسانية المؤقتة في القطاع، صباح يوم الجمعة، وهو اليوم الـ56 للعدوان.

وتتواصل الغارات التي تشنها مقاتلات الاحتلال، مما أدى إلى ارتقاء آلاف الشهداء والجرحى.

وأعلن المكتب الإعلامي الحكومي في غزة، أمس الجمعة، ارتفاع عدد الشهداء إلى 15 ألفا و110 فلسطينيين، بينهم 6150 طفلا و4000 سيدة.

وذكر المكتب الحكومي، في بيان، أن عدد شهداء الكوادر الطبية بلغ نحو 207 أطباء وممرضين ومسعفين، كما استشهد 73 صحفيا.

وزاد إجمالي عدد الإصابات عن 37 ألف حالة، أكثر من 75% منهم من الأطفال والنساء.

وأوضح أن إجمالي عدد البلاغات عن المفقودين تحت الأنقاض بلغ 6500 بلاغ، فيما بلغ إجمالي عدد الوحدات السكنية التي تضررت كليا أو جزئيا 300 ألف وحدة، إلى جانب استهداف 266 مدرسة، وخروج 26 مستشفى من الخدمة فضلا عن تدمير 56 سيارة إسعاف.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Al Jazeera article states that Israel claims the Iron Dome is 90 percent effective. However, this is a general claim about the system's effectiveness, not specifically about the October 1, 2024, attack. The ABC News article discusses the Iranian attack and the Iron Dome but does not provide an interception rate.

The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence suggests the Iron Dome is highly effective, it does not confirm the 90% interception rate for the specific attack on October 1, 2024.

Oct. 30, 2023, 2:03 PM EDT

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

!Several smoke clouds rise over an urban landscape with multi-storey concrete buildings <image:2104>

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

![Israeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border](/themes/custom/ccga/frontend/static-html/images/placeholder.png)

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:45> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:45>)
image_search("Israeli tanks Damascus Syria")
geolocate(<image:45>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Israeli tanks (<image:45>) appears in multiple articles. One article from NBC News, published on October 30, 2023, describes a video of an Israeli tank firing at a car in Gaza ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801)).

Another article from ABC News, published on May 28, 2024, discusses the Israeli offensive in Rafah, Gaza, and mentions Israeli tanks reaching the center of Rafah ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720)). A third article from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, published in 2024, discusses Russian views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and includes the image of Israeli tanks ([https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an image of an Israeli tank ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/)) <image:13287>. NDTV fact-checked the claim that the image <image:45> shows Israeli tanks near Damascus and found it to be false <image:13288>.

Al Jazeera published an article on December 8, 2024, about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights, which included an image of an Israeli tank ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls)) <image:13289>.


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.78, 'Palestine': 0.2, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is false. The image has been fact-checked and debunked by NDTV. The image was likely taken in Israel or Palestine.


## Final Judgement
The image has been fact-checked and debunked. The image does not show Israeli tanks reaching Damascus in Syria. Therefore, the claim is false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. Reverse image searches and fact-checks by NDTV found that the image does not depict Israeli tanks reaching Damascus in Syria. The image was likely taken in Israel or Palestine.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

He is a young man of 19 in a blue t-shirt, standing in the foreground, with six relatives aged from childhood to middle age smiling behind him. Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:2108>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [Witnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo)
    
*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, possibly involving tents. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows tents engulfed in flames after Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search results show that similar images of fires have been associated with Israeli strikes.

The claim's veracity cannot be determined without additional information. Specifically, it is necessary to verify the origin of the image and the context in which it was taken.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/27/first-thing-deadly-israeli-airstrike-on-refugee-tents-in-rafa-leaves-aid-groups-horrified), [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/14/israeli-strike-hospital-tent-00183579), and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/15/nx-s1-5434172/israel-iran-strikes).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, possibly involving tents. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows tents engulfed in flames after Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search results show that similar images of fires have been associated with Israeli strikes.

The claim's veracity cannot be determined without additional information. Specifically, it is necessary to verify the origin of the image and the context in which it was taken.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:47> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic social media post from Mel Gibson saying that Israel will end soon and therefore destroy everything in its way together with a flag in the color of Israel that shows an hourglass."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:47>)
image_search("Mel Gibson Israel hourglass")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Associated Press published a fact check about a social media post attributed to Mel Gibson. ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) Yahoo published a fact-check about Mel Gibson. ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)) The Times of Israel provides a picture of Mel Gibson. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/mel-gibson/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/mel-gibson/))

The sources include images of Mel Gibson (<image:14296>, <image:14297>, <image:14298>).


## Elaboration
The evidence includes links to fact checks from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)) about a social media post attributed to Mel Gibson. This suggests that the authenticity of the post is questionable and has been investigated by fact-checkers.

The presence of fact-check articles indicates that the claim's veracity is disputed. To fully assess the claim, the content of the fact-check articles would need to be reviewed.


## Actions
```
image_search("Mel Gibson social media post Israel hourglass")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53162246): 
Content: The BBC News provides an image of Mel Gibson. <image:14301>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes a BBC News image of Mel Gibson. However, it does not provide any information about the social media post in question. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity.

I need to review the content of the fact-check articles from the Associated Press and Yahoo to determine if the social media post is authentic.


## Actions
```
image_search("Mel Gibson Israel social media post")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
I am unable to verify the claim. The evidence points to fact-checks about a social media post attributed to Mel Gibson, but I lack the content of these fact-checks to determine the post's authenticity.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. Fact-checkers have investigated a social media post attributed to Mel Gibson, indicating that its authenticity is questionable. Without the content of the fact-checks, it is impossible to confirm the claim's veracity.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is likely false. Fact-checkers, including the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html)), have investigated a social media post attributed to Mel Gibson, suggesting its authenticity is doubtful.

Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

The provided evidence includes articles and images of Smotrich, but none of them are related to the claim's specific scenario. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date and location, is needed.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Claim: "<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:51>)
image_search("Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich bomb shelter Hezbollah attack")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources include articles about Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli Finance Minister. One article from Le Monde features a photograph of Smotrich ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html)). <image:7348>

The New York Times published an article on June 29, 2024, about Smotrich ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html)). <image:7349> Bloomberg also shows a picture of Smotrich ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran)). <image:7351>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

The provided evidence includes articles and images of Smotrich, but none of them are related to the claim's specific scenario. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date and location, is needed.

Content: The New York Times published an article about the conflict between Israel and Lebanon, including an image of a building. <image:14319>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence from the image search provides an article from The New York Times about the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. However, the article does not contain the image from the claim, nor does it mention Bezalel Smotrich or a bomb shelter.

The evidence does not provide any information to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date, location, and the presence of Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack, is still needed.

The web sources include articles about Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli Finance Minister. One article from Le Monde features a photograph of Smotrich ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html)). <image:7348>

The New York Times published an article on June 29, 2024, about Smotrich ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html)). <image:7349> Bloomberg also shows a picture of Smotrich ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran)). <image:7351>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

The provided evidence includes articles and images of Smotrich, but none of them are related to the claim's specific scenario. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date and location, is needed.

## Elaboration
The new evidence from the image search provides an article from The New York Times about the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. However, the article does not contain the image from the claim, nor does it mention Bezalel Smotrich or a bomb shelter.

The evidence does not provide any information to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date, location, and the presence of Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack, is still needed.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim has been identified as altered. The original photo was taken in 2009 and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The claim that the image was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is therefore false.

* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:56> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:56>)
image_search("Benjamin Netanyahu office Hezbollah")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da): Found exact image on website with title: ALTERED: This photo of a drone surveilling PM Netanyahu is ...
Content: The search result from PesaCheck states that the image <image:56> is altered. The original photo was taken on February 8, 2009, and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The article claims that the photo was edited to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The article was published 1 day ago.


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/shortly-after-strike-pms-office-releases-photo-of-netanyahu-at-military-hq/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published a photo of Benjamin Netanyahu in his office. <image:7796>


## Elaboration
The image <image:56>

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been identified as altered. The original photo was taken in 2009 and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The claim that the image was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is therefore false.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is an altered version of a photo taken in 2009, as reported by [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da). Therefore, the claim that the image was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is false.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

!Abdulrahman Almawwas <image:4699>

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake on February 7, 2023. This contradicts the claim that the image shows a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024. The evidence also includes images and articles about the situation of children in Gaza, but none of them are related to the image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Human Rights Watch report from September 5, 2007, includes an image of a man holding a framed photo (<image:14354>). The search result from palinfo.com contains an image of two children (<image:14355>). Al Jazeera published an article about children killed in Gaza (<image:14356>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports that an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza killed at least 16 people (<image:14360>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:14361>). The UNRWA website has no relevant content.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contains images and reports related to the claim. Specifically, the image search results include images of children and reports of attacks on UN schools in Gaza. However, the evidence does not directly confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the names and ages of the children, the date of the event, or the exact location (Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp).

The evidence does mention an Israeli attack on a UN school, which aligns with part of the claim. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to verify the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, I cannot fully verify the claim based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific details.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:63>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
There is no new evidence to verify the claim. Therefore, I cannot assess the veracity of the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida killed Israel")
image_search("Al-Jaoni UN school Al-Nuseirat refugee camp July 6 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Human Rights Watch report from September 5, 2007, includes an image of a man holding a framed photo (<image:14354>). The search result from palinfo.com contains an image of two children (<image:14355>). Al Jazeera published an article about children killed in Gaza (<image:14356>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports that an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza killed at least 16 people (<image:14360>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:14361>). The UNRWA website has no relevant content.


## Elaboration
The evidence contains images and reports related to the claim. Specifically, the image search results include images of children and reports of attacks on UN schools in Gaza. However, the evidence does not directly confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the names and ages of the children, the date of the event, or the exact location (Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp).

The evidence does mention an Israeli attack on a UN school, which aligns with part of the claim. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to verify the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, I cannot fully verify the claim based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific details.


## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida Al-Jaoni UN school Al-Nuseirat")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The image search did not yield any new evidence. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results provide some context about attacks on UN schools in Gaza, but they do not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the names, ages, and date. There is not enough evidence to verify the claim.

`false`
