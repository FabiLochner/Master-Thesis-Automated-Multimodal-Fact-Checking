The claim '<image:27> This image shows an athlete of China which has chosen a design of the Palestinian flag for the Paris 2024 Olympics.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image originates from the September 2023 issue of Vogue China Magazine and was used to promote the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics.
