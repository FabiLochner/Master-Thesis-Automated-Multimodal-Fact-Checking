The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Israeli ambassador was expelled from the African Union headquarters and a conference, there is no information to confirm the date of the expulsion, specifically in April 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
