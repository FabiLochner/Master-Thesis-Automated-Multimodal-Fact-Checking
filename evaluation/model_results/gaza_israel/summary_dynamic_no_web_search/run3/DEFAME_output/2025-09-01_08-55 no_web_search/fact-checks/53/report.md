## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of Donald Trump and mentions articles published on July 25, 2024, related to Israel. However, none of the provided sources contain the alleged quote from the Claim.

The search results do not provide any information about an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, nor do they contain the specific statement attributed to Trump.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide images and articles related to Donald Trump and Israel, but they do not contain the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim. Furthermore, there is no mention of an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024. Since the claim cannot be verified with the available information, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results from CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago)), tennesseelookout.com ([Source](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)), and The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html)) do not contain the alleged quote or any information about an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, as stated in the claim.
