Content: The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about the U.S. military presence in the Middle East. The article includes an image of a U.S. aircraft carrier. <image:14330>

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a naval exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, as confirmed by reverse image search results from the DVIDS website ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)). This contradicts the claim that the image shows U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
