## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, after the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, in February 2023. The evidence does not support the claim that the image is from Gaza or that it depicts a bombing in July 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a man holding the hand of his deceased daughter after the earthquake in Turkey in February 2023, not in Gaza after an Israeli bombing in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his daughter, who died in the February 2023 earthquake in Turkey, as reported by sources like *The Independent* ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)). The claim incorrectly states the image is from Gaza and related to a bombing in July 2024.
