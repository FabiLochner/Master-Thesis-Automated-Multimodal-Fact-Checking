## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding the Israeli flag. The evidence also shows that FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel. However, the evidence does not mention the date of the meeting or the ongoing Gaza war.

Therefore, the claim that the image was taken in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the date and the context of the meeting.
