The claim 'American writer James Baldwin once said: 'The state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that James Baldwin said, "The state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests," cannot be verified. While Baldwin did speak about Israel, multiple image searches did not yield any evidence of him making this specific statement.

So, the overall veracity is: false
