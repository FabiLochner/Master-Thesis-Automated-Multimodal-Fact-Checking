## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The BBC published an article on February 19, 2025, titled "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)) ![image 1074](media/2025-07-20_10-13-1753006384-630586.jpg). CNN published an article on June 7, 2025, reporting that Israel killed the leader of a Palestinian militant group, Asaad Abu Sharia, who led the Mujahideen Brigades ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl)) ![image 3326](media/2025-08-02_21-33-1754170425-742846.jpg), ![image 3327](media/2025-08-02_21-33-1754170425-888498.jpg). NDTV published an article on December 4, 2023, titled "Gaza's Youngest Hostage: Hamas Says He's Dead, Family Hoping Against Hope" ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gazas-youngest-hostage-hamas-says-hes-dead-family-hoping-against-hope-7557381](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gazas-youngest-hostage-hamas-says-hes-dead-family-hoping-against-hope-7557381)) ![image 3326](media/2025-08-02_21-33-1754170425-742846.jpg).


## Elaboration
The BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family on February 19, 2025. The article's title was "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)). This contradicts the Claim, which states the title as "Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said."


## Final Judgement
The BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family, but the title mentioned in the Claim is not accurate. The actual title of the BBC article is different.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family, the title presented in the claim, "Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said," is not accurate. The actual title of the BBC article was "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)).
