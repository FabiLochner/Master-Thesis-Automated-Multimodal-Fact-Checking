## Elaboration
The Palestine Chronicle, The Times of Israel, and Middle East Monitor report that the Israeli ambassador was expelled from the African Union headquarters and a conference on the Rwandan genocide. However, the evidence does not specify that the ambassador was expelled in April 2025.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Ethiopia Israel ambassador expulsion date")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Israeli ambassador has been expelled from the African Union headquarters and a conference on the Rwandan genocide. However, there is no information about the date of the expulsion. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that the Israeli ambassador was expelled from the African Union headquarters and a conference on the Rwandan genocide. However, there is no information about the date of the expulsion. Therefore, the claim that Ethiopia expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025 cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Israeli ambassador was expelled from the African Union headquarters and a conference, there is no information to confirm the date of the expulsion, specifically in April 2025.
