## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg): Found exact image on website with title: File:Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg
Content: The image is from Wikimedia Commons and is titled "Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg". The image shows two soldiers in Babil Province Iraq in 2007. The file was uploaded on June 21, 2011, and is in the public domain. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image in the claim is of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, according to the reverse image search. The claim states that the image shows General John Pagri, who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.

The reverse image search results contradict the claim that the image depicts General John Pagri. The image is of two soldiers, not a general, and the location is Iraq, not the Gaza Strip.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is of two soldiers in Iraq in 2007, not General John Pagri, who supposedly died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025. The reverse image search results contradict the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, according to the reverse image search, which contradicts the claim that the image depicts General John Pagri who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.
