The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/28/pro-palestinian-protesters-arrested-gal-gadot-film/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/28/pro-palestinian-protesters-arrested-gal-gadot-film/)) provided no content. NDTV ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gal-gadots-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-smashed-amid-pro-palestinian-protests-photo-is-viral-7966341](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gal-gadots-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-smashed-amid-pro-palestinian-protests-photo-is-viral-7966341)) and Fox 11 Los Angeles ([https://www.foxla.com/video/1649649](https://www.foxla.com/video/1649649)) also mention the vandalism.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. The search results show images of the damaged star, including one with graffiti. The NDTV and Fox 11 Los Angeles articles also mention the vandalism.

The claim states the vandalism occurred in March 2025, but the provided sources do not specify the exact date. The Telegraph article, which could have provided a date, has no content.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. While the vandalism is confirmed, the exact timing of the event in March 2025 cannot be verified with the provided evidence.
