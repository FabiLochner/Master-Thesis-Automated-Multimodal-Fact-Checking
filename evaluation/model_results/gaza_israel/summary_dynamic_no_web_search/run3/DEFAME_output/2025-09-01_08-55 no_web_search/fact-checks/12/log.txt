Content: Al Jazeera provides an image of the International Court of Justice. <image:14071>

The claim 'Israel has been declared an illegal state by the International Court of Justice in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The International Court of Justice has addressed the legality of Israel's occupation, as reported by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/07/19/the-world-court-says-israels-occupation-is-illegal) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/19/whats-the-icj-case-against-israels-illegal-occupation-of-palestine). However, the provided evidence does not confirm a specific ruling declaring Israel an illegal state in July 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
