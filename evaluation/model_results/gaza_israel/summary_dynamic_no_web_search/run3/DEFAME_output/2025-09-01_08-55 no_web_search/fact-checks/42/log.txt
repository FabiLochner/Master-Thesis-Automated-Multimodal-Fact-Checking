The claim 'U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on January 7, 2025 that if Israeli hostages held by Hamas 'are not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East'.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence from CNN, NPR, Foreign Policy, Reuters, and BBC News confirms that Donald Trump made a statement on January 7, 2025, regarding Israeli hostages held by Hamas. However, the exact quote from the claim, "if Israeli hostages held by Hamas 'are not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East'," has not been found in the provided sources, making it impossible to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
