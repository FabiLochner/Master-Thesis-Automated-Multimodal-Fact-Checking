Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/israeli-far-right-minister-bezalel-smotrich-annex-west-bank): 
Content: The Guardian published an article about Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli far-right minister. <image:8211>

The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. The available sources ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html), [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran), [https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/middleeast/israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/middleeast/israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/israeli-far-right-minister-bezalel-smotrich-annex-west-bank](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/israeli-far-right-minister-bezalel-smotrich-annex-west-bank)) do not provide any context related to the specific scenario described in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
