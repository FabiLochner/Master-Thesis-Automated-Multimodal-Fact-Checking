While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here).

The claim also mentions a hospitalization in November 2024, which does not align with the available information about Netanyahu's hospitalizations, including reports of a hospitalization in July 2023.
","However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic.

While the Houthis have been involved in military actions, and there are articles about Trump, no sources link the cessation of operations to the election.
","The militant group has said it will not halt its military operations, which come in response to Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Huthi rebels have maintained their attacks in international waters since Trump won the 2024 US presidential election -- and the group's leader has confirmed the outcome will not change its military strategy."
8,"<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.",False,False,True,"The claim is likely false. While Israel did launch strikes on Iran on October 26, 2024, the image's context is uncertain, as it has been used in different contexts, including events on other dates.

Trump's post said Khalil's arrest was the ""first of many to come"" and that he expected ""every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply"" with ICE's actions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an X post the day after Khalid was arrested that the department would revoke visas and green cards for ""Hamas supporters,"" and a separate X post from the official Department of Homeland Security account claimed that ""Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.""

He was joined by Steve Witkoff, his pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, who said negotiators were ""making a lot of progress"" and ""hopefully it will all work out and we'll save some lives."" Witkoff also credited Trump's ""stature"" as driving the negotiation. A journalist then asked Trump and Witkoff to clarify past remarks about how ""all hell must be paid"" if Hamas did not release the hostages, to which Trump said, while briefly addressing Witkoff: 'I don't want to hurt your negotiations, [but] if [the hostages] are not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East.

On the contrary, the latest travel by Netanyahu that could be found on news outlets was before the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27. The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.

Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough comparison of the circulating image with the one shared by Israeli media and confirmed several similarities, including protesters wearing yellow, holding photos of Israeli hostages, the Israeli flag, objects on the building roof, and the presence of 27 coffins, arranged in three rows of nine. Sky News also shared a video showing Israeli protesters carrying coffins, reporting that the coffins represent hostages killed in Gaza.
