Useful result: From [Source](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html): 
Content: The search result from Al-Haq contains an image of a woman being attacked by a dog. <image:7846>

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image in the claim appears to be digitally altered. The reverse image search did not yield any results, and the image search found other images of similar events, but not the exact one in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
