## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 65](media/99.jpg))
image_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim, ![image 65](media/99.jpg)

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a woman and a dog from China Daily ([https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm)) ![image 7844](media/2025-08-29_22-07-1756505235-961216.jpg). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, about an Israeli military dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)) ![image 7845](media/2025-08-29_22-07-1756505236-216947.jpg).

Al-Haq also contains an image of a woman being attacked by a dog ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)) ![image 7846](media/2025-08-29_22-07-1756505237-192694.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image in the claim appears to be digitally altered. The reverse image search did not yield any results, and the image search found other images of similar events, but not the exact one in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim appears to be digitally altered. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, the specific image in the claim is not found in the search results.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is likely false. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image in the claim appears to be digitally altered. The reverse image search did not yield any results, and the image search found other images of similar events, but not the exact one in the claim.
