The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that Trump signed executive orders related to UNRWA, as reported by sources like Reuters and The New York Times ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-orders-iran-withdrawing-us-un-human-rights-council-unrwa-2025-02-04/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-united-nations-unrwa.html)). However, the exact date of the executive order, January 20, 2025, as stated in the claim, could not be verified.
