The claim 'For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp.' is false.
Justification: The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, and that he used WhatsApp, as reported by the [Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-iran-what-to-know-whats-next). However, the provided sources do not offer any information to support the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination.
