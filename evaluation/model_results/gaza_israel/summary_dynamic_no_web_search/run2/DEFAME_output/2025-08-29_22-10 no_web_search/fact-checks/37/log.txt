Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-rafah-baby-unknown-al-shifa-incubator-malak-rcna146150): 
Content: NBC News published an article about the Israel-Hamas war, including an image of a baby named Malak. <image:7995>

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image features a baby named Malak, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the image depicts the youngest victim of a Hezbollah rocket attack, as the provided evidence does not corroborate this information.

So, the overall veracity is: false
