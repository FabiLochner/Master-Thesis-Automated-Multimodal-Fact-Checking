The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check confirms that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu met on July 22, 2024, as evidenced by multiple news sources, including CNN and Al Jazeera. However, the search results do not provide a direct quote from Kamala Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue," making it impossible to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
