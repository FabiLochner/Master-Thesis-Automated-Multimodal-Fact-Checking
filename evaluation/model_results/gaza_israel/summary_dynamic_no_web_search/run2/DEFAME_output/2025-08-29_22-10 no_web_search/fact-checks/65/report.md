### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about the Israeli military in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, including an image of smoke rising over the city (![image 8145](media/2025-08-29_22-21-1756506107-133367.jpg)). The Guardian also published an image of a bombardment (![image 8146](media/2025-08-29_22-21-1756506107-376373.jpg)).

Al Jazeera published an article about the Israeli strikes on Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, which contains an image of the aftermath of the bombardment (![image 8147](media/2025-08-29_22-21-1756506107-596348.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The image (![image 39](media/65.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been identified in articles about an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, in June 2024, not in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, in March 2025. The image search also shows other images related to the conflict in Gaza, but none of them match the image in the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is misrepresented. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, in June 2024, as reported by [L'Orient Today](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html) and [bhol.co.il](https://www.bhol.co.il/news/1666411), not from Deir al-Balah, Gaza, in March 2025.
