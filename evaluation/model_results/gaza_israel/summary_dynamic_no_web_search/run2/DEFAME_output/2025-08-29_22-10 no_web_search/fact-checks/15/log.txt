Useful result: From [Source](https://nationalpost.com/news/montreal-anti-israel-road-sign-messages): 
Content: The National Post published an article about anti-Israel road sign messages in Montreal. The article includes an image of a traffic sign that reads "FREE PALESTINE. ESCALATE NOW." <image:7912>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ijvcanada.org/open-letter-to-montreals-city-council-say-no-to-the-ihra-again/): 
Content: The search result from Independent Jewish Voices Canada contains an image with the text "FIGHT ANTISEMITISM, NOT PALESTINE SOLIDARITY!" and "NO IHRA IN MONTREAL!" <image:7916>.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While traffic signs in Montreal did display the message "FREE PALESTINE. ESCALATE NOW," according to reports from sources like the [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/) and The Canadian Press News, the signs were apparently hacked, and there is no evidence to support the claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.

So, the overall veracity is: false
