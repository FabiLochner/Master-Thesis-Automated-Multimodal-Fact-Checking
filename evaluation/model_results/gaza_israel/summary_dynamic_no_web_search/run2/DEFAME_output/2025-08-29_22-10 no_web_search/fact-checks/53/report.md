Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/4/trump-announces-us-crypto-reserve-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters)) shows an image of Donald Trump at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, July 25-27, 2024. ![image 8085](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505951-782699.jpg)

Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-aims-dig-obama-bizarre-171720658.html)) contains a Truth Social post by Donald J. Trump from December 25, 2024, at 10:48 AM. ![image 8086](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505952-449016.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence shows that Donald Trump was at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville on July 25, 2024, and posted on Truth Social on December 25, 2024. However, there is no evidence of a Truth Social post on July 25, 2024, reacting to an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, nor is there any evidence of the specific quote mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times ([Source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-10-17/panel-looking-into-trump-assassination-attempt-says-secret-service-needs-fundamental-reform)) published an article on October 17, 2024, about a panel investigating an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Axios ([Source](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/trump-assassination-truth-social-update)) reports on an update on Truth Social regarding an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024. ![image 8091](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505965-000896.jpg), ![image 8092](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505965-940070.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, and that there was an update on Truth Social regarding the event. However, the evidence does not provide the content of the Truth Social post.

The claim states a specific quote from a Truth Social post on July 25, 2024. While the evidence confirms the existence of an assassination attempt and a Truth Social update, it does not provide any information about a post on July 25, 2024, nor does it contain the specific quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles from CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago)), The Tennessee Lookout ([Source](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)), and The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html)) about Donald Trump and Israeli leaders. The CNN article discusses a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu ![image 8096](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505979-520301.jpg). The Tennessee Lookout article covers an address by an Israeli leader ![image 8097](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505979-883996.jpg). The New York Times article also focuses on Trump and Netanyahu ![image 8098](media/2025-08-29_22-19-1756505980-057907.jpg). None of the sources mention a Truth Social post by Trump on July 25, 2024, with the specific quote from the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence shows that Donald Trump was involved in meetings and events related to Israel around July 25, 2024. However, there is no evidence of a Truth Social post on July 25, 2024, containing the specific quote from the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump and he was active on Truth Social, there is no evidence of a post on July 25, 2024, containing the specific quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel." The search results show Trump was at a conference and involved in events related to Israel around that time, but no post with the mentioned quote was found.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsubstantiated. While there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump and he was active on Truth Social, there is no evidence of a post on July 25, 2024, containing the specific quote. The search results show Trump was at a conference and involved in events related to Israel around that time, but no post with the mentioned quote was found.
