Useful result: From [Source](https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-announces-decisive-powerful-airstrikes-against-houthi-terrorists-yemen): 
Content: Fox News published an article that includes an image of armed Houthi rebels and Donald Trump (<image:7864>). The article discusses Trump and airstrikes against the Houthis.

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-orders-attacks-houthis-yemen/story?id=119835025): 
Content: ABC News published an article that includes an image of military aircraft on an aircraft carrier (<image:7865>). The article is about Trump ordering attacks on the Houthis in Yemen.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the Houthis ceased military operations in international waters after Trump's potential 2024 election victory. While the Houthis have been involved in military actions, and there are articles about Trump, no sources link the cessation of operations to the election.

So, the overall veracity is: false
