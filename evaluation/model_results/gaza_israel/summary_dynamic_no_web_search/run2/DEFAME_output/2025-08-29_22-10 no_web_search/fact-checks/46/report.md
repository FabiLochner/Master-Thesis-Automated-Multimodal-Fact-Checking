Content: The search result from The Journal, published in December 2024, shows an AI-generated image of Bono and Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags. ![image 8014](media/2025-08-29_22-17-1756505861-108403.jpg)

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as official announcements or news reports about the tour.
