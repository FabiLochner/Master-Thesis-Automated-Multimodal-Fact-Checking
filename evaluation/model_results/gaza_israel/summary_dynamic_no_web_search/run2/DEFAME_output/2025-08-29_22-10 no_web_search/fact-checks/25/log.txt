Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-07-29/starmer-says-uk-will-recognize-palestinian-state-unless-israel-agrees-to-a-ceasefire): 
Content: The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 29, 2025, stating that Keir Starmer said the UK will recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire. <image:7941>

The claim 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check did not find any evidence to support the claim that Keir Starmer said the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024. While articles from sources like The Guardian and Los Angeles Times discuss Starmer's views on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including a statement about recognizing a Palestinian state, none of them mention a boycott of diplomatic relations within the specified timeframe. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
