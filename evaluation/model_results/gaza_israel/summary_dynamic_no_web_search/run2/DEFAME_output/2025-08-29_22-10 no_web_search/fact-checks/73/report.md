## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 45](media/73.jpg)) appears in multiple articles. One article from NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801)) discusses a video of an Israeli tank firing at a car in Gaza. Another article from ABC News ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720)) mentions Israeli tanks in Rafah, Gaza.

The Chicago Council on Global Affairs ([https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations)) also uses the image (![image 45](media/73.jpg)) in an article about Russian youth's views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an image of an Israeli tank ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/)) ![image 8176](media/2025-08-29_22-23-1756506201-128115.jpg). NDTV.com includes an image of Israeli tanks with the claim "Israeli tanks are near the Syrian capital of Damascus." ![image 8177](media/2025-08-29_22-23-1756506201-279394.jpg) The image has a "FALSE" label. The post date is December 10, 2024.

Al Jazeera published an article about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights, which includes an image of an Israeli tank ![image 8178](media/2025-08-29_22-23-1756506201-552557.jpg) ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls)).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is likely false. The image search results show that the image was used in articles about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Israeli tanks near Damascus. However, one of the search results, from NDTV.com, labels a similar image as "FALSE" and dates it to December 10, 2024. Additionally, the reverse image search shows the image being used in articles about Gaza and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.


## Final Judgement
The image has been used in multiple contexts, including articles about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Israeli tanks near Damascus. However, one source explicitly labels a similar image as false. Therefore, the claim is likely false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is likely false. While the image of Israeli tanks appears in articles related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and near Damascus, a search result from NDTV.com ([https://www.ndtv.com/](https://www.ndtv.com/)) explicitly labels a similar image as "FALSE" and dates it to December 10, 2024.
