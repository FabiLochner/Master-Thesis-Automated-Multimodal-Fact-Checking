### Evidence from `image_search`
NPR reports on Hezbollah pager explosions across Lebanon in September 2024, causing nearly 3,000 casualties. ([https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-23452/hezbollah-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-causing-nearly-3-000-casualties](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-23452/hezbollah-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-causing-nearly-3-000-casualties)) The CNN article contains an image of an explosion. ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-attack-hezbollah](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-attack-hezbollah)) The Guardian published an article on September 17, 2024, about an incident in Lebanon where hundreds of Hezbollah members were hurt.

The provided sources include images related to the explosions. ![image 7886](media/2025-08-29_22-13-1756505584-384041.jpg) ![image 7887](media/2025-08-29_22-13-1756505584-639978.jpg) ![image 7888](media/2025-08-29_22-13-1756505584-853256.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image provided in the claim is from an article about a toilet explosion in Noida, India, published on May 14, 2025, and is unrelated to Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon. The image search results show images related to the Hezbollah pager explosions, but not the one in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from an article about a toilet explosion in India, not related to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon. The image search confirms the existence of Hezbollah pager explosions but does not show the image in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from a May 2025 article about a toilet explosion in Noida, India, as reported by the [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms), and is unrelated to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon in September 2024.
