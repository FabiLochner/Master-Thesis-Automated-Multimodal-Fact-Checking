### Evidence from `reverse_search`

The child was treated in hospitals in Idlib, Turkey, and Abu Dhabi. The image is found in articles from Enab Baladi ([https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)) and UAE Times ([https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)).

The image was also used in an article from El Pa√≠s ([https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html)) discussing the tactics of repression.

The claim is false. The image depicts a Syrian child named Sham who was rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake on February 7, 2023, not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.
