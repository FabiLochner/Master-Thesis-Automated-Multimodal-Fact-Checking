## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/hamas-islamic-jihad-claim-responsibility-tel-aviv-explosion-what-we-know): 
Content: Al-Monitor published an article about an explosion in Tel Aviv, with Hamas and Islamic Jihad claiming responsibility. The article includes an image of the aftermath of the explosion. ![image 8240](media/2025-08-29_22-27-1756506429-202285.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024 is not directly supported by the evidence. While the evidence confirms an explosion in Tel Aviv in July 2024, the cause is not specified as a Houthi attack. The evidence mentions a drone attack on Tel Aviv, but it does not specify who was responsible. Additionally, the image search results show that Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for an explosion in Tel Aviv.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that there was an explosion in Tel Aviv in July 2024, but the cause is not confirmed as a Houthi attack. The image search results show that Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for an explosion in Tel Aviv.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, in July 2024. While there were explosions in Tel Aviv during that time, the evidence does not support the claim that it was a Houthi attack. Instead, sources like [Al-Monitor](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/hamas-islamic-jihad-claim-responsibility-tel-aviv-explosion-what-we-know) report that Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for an explosion in Tel Aviv.
