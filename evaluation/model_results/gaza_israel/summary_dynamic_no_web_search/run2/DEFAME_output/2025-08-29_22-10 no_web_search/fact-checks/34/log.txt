The claim '<image:23> This image shows Israel bombing Tehran on October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim, sourced from Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images, depicts a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran that occurred on June 2, 2021, as reported by sources like The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)). While there were reports of Israel strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, the image is unrelated to those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
