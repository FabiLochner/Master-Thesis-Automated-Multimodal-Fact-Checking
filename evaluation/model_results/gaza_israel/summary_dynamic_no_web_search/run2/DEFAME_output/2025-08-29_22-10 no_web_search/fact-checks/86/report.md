## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 55](media/86.jpg)) shows the USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arriving in Kiel, Germany, on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24. The photo was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea. The exercise involved ships from various NATO countries. The USS Mount Whitney served as the command and control center for the exercise. The image is also found on a U.S. Department of Defense website, which discusses NATO.

The first source is from DVIDS ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)), and the second source is from a U.S. Department of Defense website ([https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/)).


## Elaboration
The image depicts the USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, during the BALTOPS 24 exercise, not en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows the USS Mount Whitney in the Baltic Sea during a NATO exercise in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts the USS Mount Whitney in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, during the BALTOPS 24 exercise, as confirmed by DVIDS ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)) and a U.S. Department of Defense website ([https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/3828763/us-officials-agree-natos-worth-is-unquestionable/)), not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.
