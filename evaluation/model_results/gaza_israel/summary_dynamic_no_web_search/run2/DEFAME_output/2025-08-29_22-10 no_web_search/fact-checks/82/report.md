## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The image search also confirms that there was an attack by Hezbollah on Israel on August 25, 2024. However, I cannot confirm that the image in the claim shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the attack. I need to find the context of the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("Bezalel Smotrich image location")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
I am unable to verify the claim. While the evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and that there was an attack by Hezbollah on Israel on August 25, 2024, I have no information about the image's context. I cannot confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the attack.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and that there was an attack by Hezbollah on Israel on August 25, 2024. However, the context of the image in the claim is unknown. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and that there was an attack by Hezbollah on Israel on August 25, 2024, the context of the image in the claim is unknown, and it cannot be confirmed that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the attack.
