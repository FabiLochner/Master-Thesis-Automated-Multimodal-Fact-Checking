Justification: The claim cannot be definitively confirmed as true or false without verifying the exact quote. However, evidence from sources like CNN and NPR ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/trump-warning-gaza-hostages-negotiations-inauguration](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/trump-warning-gaza-hostages-negotiations-inauguration), [https://www.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5250278/trump-hostages-israel-hamas-middle-east](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5250278/trump-hostages-israel-hamas-middle-east)) indicates that Donald Trump did make a statement on January 7, 2025, regarding Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

So, the overall veracity is: false
