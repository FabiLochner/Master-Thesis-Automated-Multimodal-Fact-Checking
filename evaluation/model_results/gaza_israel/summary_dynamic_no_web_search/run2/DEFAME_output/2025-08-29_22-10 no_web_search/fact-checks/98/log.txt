Useful result: From [Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/): 
Content: The Myth Detector published an article about a fabricated quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson, which was accompanied by an image of the Israeli flag. <image:8255>

The claim '<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.' is false.
Justification: The image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag is likely fabricated. A search revealed that a fabricated quote attributed to Johnson was circulating with an image of the Israeli flag, as reported by the Myth Detector ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
