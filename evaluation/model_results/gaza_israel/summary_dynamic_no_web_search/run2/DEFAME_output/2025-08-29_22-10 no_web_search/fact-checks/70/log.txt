Useful result: From [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-iran-war-iron-dome-missiles-nuclear-weapons-b2623680.html): 
Content: The Independent published an article with an image of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles <image:8170>. The article does not mention the interception rate.

The claim 'The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While images from sources like Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/)) and Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) show the Iron Dome in action during the attack, and Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/iran-and-israel-what-are-their-attack-and-defence-capabilities)) states that Israel claims the Iron Dome is 90 percent effective, none of the provided sources specify the interception rate for the October 1, 2024, attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
