# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that he postponed a visit to Washington ([https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/](https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/)). Additionally, images from Al Jazeera and NPR show him alive in November 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant), [https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)).

The claim that Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is therefore false.

OPB published an image of Mahmoud Khalil. ABC News published an image of Mahmoud Khalil (<image:7580>). NBC News published an image of Mahmoud Khalil.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Mahmoud Khalil was arrested. However, the evidence does not mention ICE's involvement in the arrest or Khalil's status as a lawful permanent resident.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The initial searches confirmed the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil in March 2025, as reported by multiple news outlets. However, the searches did not provide any information about ICE's involvement in the arrest or Khalil's status as a lawful permanent resident. Subsequent searches also failed to provide the missing information.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm that ICE agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil or that he was a lawful permanent resident. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unverified. While multiple news sources confirm the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil in March 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were involved in the arrest, nor does it verify his status as a lawful permanent resident.

OCHA's map from November 16, 2024, indicates a current population of 2.1 million in Gaza, with the population in October 2023 at 750K and in November 2024 at 340-375K. The map also shows that 79% of Gaza's area has been evacuated, with 1.9 million internally displaced persons (<image:7157>). The BBC article shows that within 10 days of October 7, over one million people were forced to leave their homes, and as of January 14, 2025, an estimated 1.9 million people were internally displaced (<image:7158>).

An article from anera.org provides a graph showing the population of Gaza from 1947 to 2023, with the population in 2023 at 2.2 million (<image:7159>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population of Gaza. The OCHA map indicates a population of 750K in October 2023 and 2.1 million in November 2024. The BBC article states that 2.2 million people lived in Gaza before October 7, 2023. The anera.org article also states that the population in 2023 was 2.2 million.

Based on the OCHA map, the population increased from 750K to 2.1 million. However, the BBC article and the anera.org article suggest a population of 2.2 million before October 7, 2023. The claim cannot be verified because the exact population on October 7, 2023, is not consistent across the provided sources.

To verify the claim, the exact population of Gaza on October 7, 2023, and the current population are needed.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023."

## Actions
```
image_search("Gaza population increase October 7 2023")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
OCHA's map from November 16, 2024, indicates a current population of 2.1 million in Gaza, with the population in October 2023 at 750K and in November 2024 at 340-375K. The map also shows that 79% of Gaza's area has been evacuated, with 1.9 million internally displaced persons (<image:7157>). The BBC article shows that within 10 days of October 7, over one million people were forced to leave their homes, and as of January 14, 2025, an estimated 1.9 million people were internally displaced (<image:7158>).

An article from anera.org provides a graph showing the population of Gaza from 1947 to 2023, with the population in 2023 at 2.2 million (<image:7159>).


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population of Gaza. The OCHA map indicates a population of 750K in October 2023 and 2.1 million in November 2024. The BBC article states that 2.2 million people lived in Gaza before October 7, 2023. The anera.org article also states that the population in 2023 was 2.2 million.

Based on the OCHA map, the population increased from 750K to 2.1 million. However, the BBC article and the anera.org article suggest a population of 2.2 million before October 7, 2023. The claim cannot be verified because the exact population on October 7, 2023, is not consistent across the provided sources.

To verify the claim, the exact population of Gaza on October 7, 2023, and the current population are needed.

Israel declares ‘state of war’ after Hamas militants launch surprise attack from Gaza (videos)

Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel  on Saturday morning, October 7 in a surprise assault as several gunmen crossed into different Israeli towns while a heavy barrage of rockets are fired from the Gaza Strip.

As at press time, warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem.

At least 40 people have been killed since Hamas launched the surprise attack on Israel, the country’s emergency service said.

Another 779 people have been wounded, according to the Israeli Health Ministry.

  
Israel’s military said it was on a war footing and the defense minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a “grave mistake” by declaring war on Israel, in retaliation, Israeli military launched air strikes into Gaza.

  
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said Hamas had “launched a war against the State of Israel”. Israeli “troops are fighting against the enemy at every location”, he said.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313160-1696661234669-gettyimages-1711150149-20090101231007-911-002189_1696674381.jpeg)

  
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.

> “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel’s police chief said there were “21 active scenes” in southern Israel.

  
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of war ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

  
Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313161-1696664544161-gettyimages-1711245488-AFP_33XP63Y_1696674371.jpeg)

  
“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from a Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said militants had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.

>   
> “They just came in again, please send help,” she said. “There are a lot of homes harmed … My husband is holding the door closed … They are firing rounds of bullets.”

Palestinian media reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.

  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in  a speech this morning said the country was in war. His office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours.

  
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.

  
“We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,” said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.

  
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to meet with his top security officials on Saturday morning.  <br>>   <br>> Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the “element of surprise” in the early morning attack which appeared to involve Palestinian fighters in trucks inside Israel and on paragliders, in addition to the rocket fire, will leave Israelis “shocked and stunned”.<br><br>  <br>[SOURCE](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports)<br><br>**10 Likes** **3 Shares**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740638_img20231007063148_jpeg0756aad4954d77978ecd178fbbf6930c)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740639_screenmaster20231007063416_jpeg8a2723256f4e323049af97dfa8770b6f)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740640_img20231007064058_jpeg7dcde991e6026c7a8397b6e3a5f2cf93)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740641_img20231007064203_jpeg6ab49057eb636386ec9a67b195b39b00) |

| I want to believe no terrorist will moan when the mighty hand of Israel hit them hard. I've always said it, these religious lot are nothing but a bunch of barbarians. Give 'em an inch and they'll sink your country like the Titanic. Just look at what's been going on up north in Nigeria. The whole point of their religion seems to be causing trouble and chaos, so it's no surprise that their followers are just as bad.  <br>  <br>They're a bunch of hypocrites, aren't they? They blow things up, run and hide, then come out crying when the Israelis strike back. They use civilians as human shields, the bloody cowards! It's like they have no shame. All they know how to do is make trouble, then play the victim when things go south. They're a bunch of chancers, the lot of them. Bloody cowards!  <br>  <br>I 'ope these ruddy terrorists know that the Israelis don't muck about when it comes to lookin' out for their own. If any of their Yank cousins got caught up in it, it'd be a right proper problem for them. I think they've forgotten about what happened in Munich, and the consequences after that. This could be right nasty, if you get my drift.

| They always start the attack smiling and end in tears. It's no longer new, as we're getting used to it. Just that their Islamic international community will be shouting "unfair & injustice" by the time Israel responds by defending themselves. Now they will not talk to their people or condemn this "surprised" attack but they will be all out campaigning against and condemning Israel for defending themselves.  <br>  <br>The major problems we have on earth are:  <br>1\.

    **আল-কাসসামের সফল অপারেশন: খান ইউনিসে ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের দুটি ট্যাংক ধ্বংস**
    
    ! <image:4221>
    
      
      
      
      
    ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা ও অত্যাচারের বিরুদ্ধে ফিলিস্তিনি মুজাহিদদের সংগ্রাম অব্যাহত রয়েছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস তাদের সর্বশেষ অপারেশনে ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক ধ্বংস করেছে। খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় সংঘটিত এই অপারেশনে ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও সাইড আইইডি ব্যবহার করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীদের উপর কঠোর প্রতিশোধ নেওয়া হয়েছে।  
      
    আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবার এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে যে তাদের যোদ্ধারা কেন্দ্রীয় খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক লক্ষ্য করে দুটি ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও একটি সাইড আইইডি’র বিস্ফোরণ ঘটিয়ে সেগুলো সফলভাবে ধ্বংস করেছে। এই অপারেশনটি গাজা উপত্যকায় ইসরায়েলের অব্যাহত গণহত্যা, ধ্বংসযজ্ঞ ও মানবতাবিরোধী অপরাধের জবাব হিসেবে পরিচালিত হয়েছে।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনী ২০২৩ সাল থেকে গাজায় নৃশংস হামলা চালাচ্ছে। আন্তর্জাতিক আদালতের রায় উপেক্ষা করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীরা গাজায় অবরোধ দিয়ে, খাদ্য ও ওষুধের সংকট সৃষ্টি করে মানবিক বিপর্যয় ডেকে এনেছে। এমনকি বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা (WHO) ও জাতিসংঘ বারবার সতর্ক করেও ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা বন্ধ করতে পারেনি।  
      
    এই পরিস্থিতিতে আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের মতো ফিলিস্তিনি প্রতিরোধ গ্রুপগুলোর অপারেশন ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের জন্য ক্রমাগত চ্যালেঞ্জ হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে। গত জুলাই মাসেও আল-কাসসাম ও আল-কুদস ব্রিগেডস যৌথভাবে ইসরায়েলি সেনাদের ওপর মর্টার হামলা চালিয়ে যানবাহন ধ্বংস করেছিল।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর নৃশংসতা যতই বাড়ছে, ফিলিস্তিনি জনগণের প্রতিরোধের চেতনা ততই শাণিত হচ্ছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবারের সফল অপারেশন প্রমাণ করে যে, অন্যায়ের বিরুদ্ধে সংগ্রাম কখনই থামানো যায় না। ইসরায়েলের অভ্যন্তরে বেড়ে চলেছে হতাশা নেতৃত্বহীনতার অভিযোগ। যুদ্ধের সময় যত গড়াচ্ছে, ততই স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠছে—যারা একদিন দখল নিতে এসেছিল, তারা আজ নিজেরাই দিশেহারা।

    **কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে যুগান্তকারী বাণিজ্য সহযোগিতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া**
    
    ! <image:4223>
    
      
      
    দ্বিপক্ষীয় অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক জোরদার করতে কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে একটি ব্যাপক অর্থনৈতিক পদক্ষেপ হাতে নিয়েছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তান। এই উদ্দেশ্যে একটি বিস্তারিত রোডম্যাপ প্রণয়ন ও সমঝোতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে উভয় পক্ষ। সম্প্রতি ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শিল্প ও বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রী নূরুদ্দিন আজিজি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ’র কিরগিজস্তান সফরকালে এই চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এই সময় বাণিজ্য সম্পর্ক সম্প্রসারণ ও ব্যবসায় বাধা অপসারণ করতে কিরগিজ প্রতিনিধিদের সাথে ব্যাপক আলোচনা উপস্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এছাড়া যৌথ বাণিজ্য কাউন্সিল গঠন, নিয়মিত বৈঠক আয়োজন এবং অগ্রগতি পর্যবেক্ষণের জন্য একটি যৌথ ওয়ার্কিং গ্রুপ গঠনের বিষয়ে উক্ত সভায় আলোচনা হয়েছে।  
      
    ট্রেড হাউস ও বাণিজ্যিক কেন্দ্র চালু করা, অর্থনৈতিক ফোরাম, প্রদর্শনী এবং আফগানিস্তানে যৌথ বিনিয়োগ সম্প্রসারণের পরিকল্পনা উত্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    দ্বিপাক্ষিক ট্রানজিট করিডোর, বাণিজ্য ও ট্রানজিট উন্নয়ন চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর এবং উজবেকিস্তান ও তাজিকিস্তানকে জড়িত করে ত্রিপক্ষীয় সহযোগিতায় কাজ করতে উভয়ে সম্মত হয়েছে।  
      
    নতুন এই চুক্তিতে কিরগিজ প্রশাসনের পক্ষ থেকে আফগান ব্যবসায়ীদের বাণিজ্যিক ভিসা, ব্যাংকিং সংযোগ ও পরিবহন রুট সহজতর করার প্রতিশ্রুতি রয়েছে।  
      
    আফগানিস্তান দক্ষিণ এশিয়া, মধ্য এশিয়া এবং মধ্য প্রাচ্যকে সংযোগকারী ট্রানজিট হাব হয়ে উঠার প্রবল সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে। তাই কৌশলগত অবস্থানকে কাজে লাগিয়ে মধ্য এশিয়ার রাষ্ট্রগুলোতে বাণিজ্য সম্প্রসারণ করছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া।  
      
    উক্ত সমঝোতা স্মারক দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কের ক্ষেত্রে একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য মাইলফলক হিসেবে অভিহিত করেছেন উভয় পক্ষ। এর মাধ্যমে উভয় দেশের মধ্যে ব্যবসা বৃদ্ধি ও অর্থনৈতিক সংহতির পথ প্রশস্ত হবে বলে প্রত্যাশা করা হচ্ছে।

    **আমেরিকার প্রচারিত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে রাজনৈতিক সুর বিদ্যমান: জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ**
    
    ! <image:4228>
    
      
      
    ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তানে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সরাসরি উপস্থিতি নেই, তারা আফগানিস্তান সম্পর্কে প্রত্যক্ষ জ্ঞানও রাখে না, তা সত্ত্বেও মানবাধিকার ইস্যুতে নিজেদের ইচ্ছে মতো মূল্যায়ন প্রকাশ করে যাচ্ছে ওয়াশিংটন। মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্র দপ্তরের মানবাধিকার বিষয়ক বার্ষিক প্রতিবেদনের প্রতিক্রিয়ায় এসব মন্তব্য করেন ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার মুখপাত্র জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ।  
      
    উক্ত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে দাবি করা হয়, তালিবান সরকারের অধীনে আফগানিস্তানে মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষা উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে হ্রাস পেয়েছে। নারী অধিকার ও মত প্রকাশের স্বাধীনতা লঙ্ঘিত হয়েছে।  
      
    জবাবে মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ বলেন, আফগানিস্তানে কোনও মার্কিন দূতাবাস নেই। তাই তাদের পক্ষে আফগানিস্তানের বাস্তবতা, অগ্রগতি বা মানবাধিকারের বিষয়গুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করা চলে না। এই প্রতিবেদনগুলোর সাথে রাজনৈতিক উদ্দেশ্য জড়িত, অধিকাংশ প্রতিবেদন ষড়যন্ত্রের হাতিয়ার হিসেবে প্রকাশ করা হয়ে থাকে।  
      
    তিনি জোর দিয়ে বলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উচিত মার্কিন দখলদারিত্বের সময়ের সাথে আফগানিস্তানের বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি তুলনা করা, মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে কোন সময়কালটি অধিক উত্তম সেটা তারা অনুধাবন করুক।  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, আফগান ইস্যু নিয়ে আমেরিকার উদ্বিগ্ন হওয়া উচিত নয়, কেননা নাগরিকদের অধিকার সম্পর্কে বর্তমান সরকার অবগত আছে। আফগানিস্তানের একটি একটি ধর্মীয় ও আইনি দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি রয়েছে, নাগরিকদের অধিকার নিশ্চিত করতে এখানে ধর্মীয় বাধ্যবাধকতা রয়েছে।

    **ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার চার বছরের অর্জন: সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক দু’ক্ষেত্রেই বিজয়**
    
    ! <image:4231>
    
      
      
      
    আফগানিস্তানে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শাসন পুনঃপ্রতিষ্ঠার চার বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। এ উপলক্ষে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার কর্মকর্তারা সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রে নিজেদের অর্জনের ওপর আলোকপাত করেছেন।  
      
    গত ১৩ আগস্ট কাতারে অবস্থিত ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার দূতাবাসের ভারপ্রাপ্ত প্রধান সুহাইল শাহিন হাফিযাহুল্লাহ জানান, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার বিজয় অর্জনের ফলে শত্রুদের রাজনৈতিক ও কৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ব্যর্থ হয়েছে এবং দেশের প্রশাসনিক কাঠামো আরও মজবুত হয়েছে।  
      
    তিনি বলেন, ‘এই বিজয়ের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া শুধু সামরিক নয়, রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রেও সফলতা অর্জন করেছে। এই উদ্যোগ আফগানিস্তানে ইসলামি শাসন প্রতিষ্ঠার পথকে সুগম করেছে।’  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার সদস্যদের প্রচেষ্টা ও আফগান জনগণের ত্যাগের কারণে বিশ্ব শক্তি ও তাদের মিত্ররা পরাজিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এর আগে, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার জ্যেষ্ঠ নেতা আনাস হাক্কানি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ দোহা চুক্তিকে আফগানিস্তানে আমেরিকার পরাজয়ের লিখিত স্বীকৃতি হিসেবে বর্ণনা করেন। তিনি বলেন, চুক্তির মাধ্যমে আমেরিকা ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তর করতে বাধ্য হয়েছিল, যদিও শুরুতে তারা আলোচনা এড়িয়ে গিয়েছিল। হাক্কানি জানান, তালিবান পারস্পরিক সমঝোতার মাধ্যমে ক্ষমতায় আসতে চাইলেও সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট আশরাফ ঘানির হঠাৎ পলায়ন সেই পরিকল্পনায় পরিবর্তন আনে।

## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation data suggests that the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the exact location or the circumstances of the tank's destruction. The claim's assertion about the ambush by Hamas fighters and the destruction of multiple vehicles cannot be verified with the available evidence.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is associated with the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine or Israel. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the tank was ambushed by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in October 2024, nor does it confirm the destruction of multiple vehicles and casualties.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on October 18, 2024, about Israel sending more troops into northern Gaza, including an image of destruction in Gaza <image:7683>. Le Monde published an article on October 27, 2024, about the Jabalia refugee camp, including an image of the camp <image:7684>. The Los Angeles Times published an article on October 31, 2023, about an Israeli strike on a Gaza refugee camp <image:7685>.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image <image:34>

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:34>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests that the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the exact location or the circumstances of the tank's destruction. The claim's assertion about the ambush by Hamas fighters and the destruction of multiple vehicles cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests that the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the exact location or the circumstances of the tank's destruction. The claim's assertion about the ambush by Hamas fighters and the destruction of multiple vehicles cannot be verified with the available evidence.

The image is associated with the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine or Israel. However, the claim that the image depicts an Israeli tank unit ambushed by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in October 2024, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews, cannot be verified. There is no evidence to confirm the specific details of the ambush or the date.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on October 18, 2024, about Israel sending more troops into northern Gaza, including an image of destruction in Gaza <image:7683>. Le Monde published an article on October 27, 2024, about the Jabalia refugee camp, including an image of the camp <image:7684>.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image <image:34>

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:34>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests that the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the exact location or the circumstances of the tank's destruction. The claim's assertion about the ambush by Hamas fighters and the destruction of multiple vehicles cannot be verified with the available evidence.


## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an image of a burning tank in Gaza <image:7701> on October 7, 2024, while Business Insider published an article in July 2024 about Israeli troops in Gaza, including an image of an Israeli tank <image:7702>. Reuters published an article on October 2, 2024, about Israel sending tanks into southern Gaza, including an image of destruction <image:7703>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image <image:34>

## Final Judgement
The image is associated with the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine or Israel. However, the claim that the image depicts an Israeli tank unit ambushed by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in October 2024, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews, cannot be verified. There is no evidence to confirm the specific details of the ambush or the date.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a burning tank, potentially in the context of the Israel-Hamas conflict, but the claim that it shows an Israeli tank unit ambushed by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in October 2024 cannot be verified due to a lack of supporting evidence.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/)
 is calling on Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s [visit to an ammunition plant](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.

The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy [addressed the United Nations](https://apnews.com/video/war-and-unrest-ukraine-government-ukraine-russia-government-russia-eae042530895412f9447f6c70f7f27c1)
 in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the [war effort](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 before [meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489)
.

“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.

Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.

An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.

Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.

The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.

While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.

Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.”

Zelenskyy visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-75a9ca2e3be09578c65f1198ba5b72e5)
 to thank the workers who are producing one of the [most critically needed munitions](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)
 for [his country’s fight](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 to fend off Russian ground forces.

The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture [155 mm artillery shells](https://apnews.com/article/155mm-howitzer-ukraine-ammunition-russia-7d966c85046b73db2b013f93c51af2a5)
 and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.

“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

“Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”

Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.

Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he [visited Utah](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-governors-c777901001422bbc5e0885a1824a67c9)
 to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans.

The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.

However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.

“If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said.

The Penn Capital-Star published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition factory (<image:7267>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition, specifically artillery shells, at an ammunition factory. The event occurred in September 2024. The evidence does not mention Israeli bombs or that the ammunition was intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition. The BBC News published articles on September 26, 2024, discussing Zelensky's meeting with US President Joe Biden and his visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he signed ammunition. The Associated Press published an article on September 25, 2024, discussing House Speaker Mike Johnson's demand for Zelenskyy to remove Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. due to Zelenskyy's visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant.

The articles do not mention Israeli bombs or Gaza.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing a bomb (<image:7264>). The BBC News website shows an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells (<image:7265>). The Penn Capital-Star published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition factory (<image:7267>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition, specifically artillery shells, at an ammunition factory. The event occurred in September 2024. The evidence does not mention Israeli bombs or that the ammunition was intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


# Your Judgement

The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition, not Israeli bombs. The event took place in September 2024, not March 2025. There is no evidence to support the claim that the ammunition was intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:42> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:42>)
image_search("Israel military forces Tasil Daraa")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.68, 'Israel': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.03, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5178173-israeli-forces-infiltrate-several-syrian-villages-quneitra-and-daraa): 
Content: The search result from Asharq Al-Awsat discusses Israeli forces infiltrating several Syrian villages in Quneitra and Daraa. <image:7729>


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:42>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. The image search reveals that Israeli forces have been reported in the Daraa region. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific claim that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and any accompanying details about the location and date.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.68, 'Israel': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.03, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5178173-israeli-forces-infiltrate-several-syrian-villages-quneitra-and-daraa): 
Content: The search result from Asharq Al-Awsat discusses Israeli forces infiltrating several Syrian villages in Quneitra and Daraa. <image:7729>


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:42>

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. The image search reveals that Israeli forces have been reported in the Daraa region. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific claim that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and any accompanying details about the location and date.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could be related to Israeli military activity in the region, but it does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the location (Tasil) and the date (February 2025). Therefore, there is not enough information to verify the claim. `not enough information`

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. The image search reveals that Israeli forces have been reported in the Daraa region. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific claim that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and any accompanying details about the location and date.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results discuss the Israeli military presence in Syria and Israeli strikes in southern Syria. One source is from Syria Direct ([https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/](https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/)) and the other is from The Long War Journal ([https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/03/israel-strikes-gunmen-in-southern-syria-damascus-says-civilians-killed.php](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/03/israel-strikes-gunmen-in-southern-syria-damascus-says-civilians-killed.php)). <image:7735> and <image:7736>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from the image search provides additional context. It confirms the presence of Israeli military forces in the region, including reports of strikes in southern Syria. However, the search results do not specifically mention the town of Tasil or the date February 2025.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence supports the presence of Israeli forces in the general area but lacks specific details to confirm the claim's location and date.

The search results discuss the Israeli military presence in Syria and Israeli strikes in southern Syria. One source is from Syria Direct ([https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/](https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/)) and the other is from The Long War Journal ([https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/03/israel-strikes-gunmen-in-southern-syria-damascus-says-civilians-killed.php](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/03/israel-strikes-gunmen-in-southern-syria-damascus-says-civilians-killed.php)). <image:7735> and <image:7736>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from the image search provides additional context. It confirms the presence of Israeli military forces in the region, including reports of strikes in southern Syria. However, the search results do not specifically mention the town of Tasil or the date February 2025.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence supports the presence of Israeli forces in the general area but lacks specific details to confirm the claim's location and date.


## Actions
```
image_search("Tasil Daraa February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results discuss protests in Syria against Israeli strikes, as reported by MEMRI ([https://www.memri.org/jttm/protesting-israeli-strikes-syria-actions-gaza-syrians-chant-nation-wants-jihad-declared](https://www.memri.org/jttm/protesting-israeli-strikes-syria-actions-gaza-syrians-chant-nation-wants-jihad-declared)). Etana Syria provides a Syria update from February 19-22, 2025, including a map of incidents in Daraa province ([https://etanasyria.org/syria-update-19-22-february-2025/](https://etanasyria.org/syria-update-19-22-february-2025/)). <image:7745> and <image:7746>


## Elaboration
The latest search results provide more context, including a map of incidents in Daraa province from February 19-22, 2025. However, the evidence still does not directly confirm the claim. The map from Etana Syria ([https://etanasyria.org/syria-update-19-22-february-2025/](https://etanasyria.org/syria-update-19-22-february-2025/)) shows incidents in Daraa, but it does not specifically mention Tasil or Israeli military forces entering the town.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of specific evidence linking the image to the town of Tasil and the date February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image search results confirm the presence of Israeli military forces in the region and provide a map of incidents in Daraa province during the specified time frame. However, the evidence does not specifically mention the town of Tasil or confirm that the image depicts Israeli forces entering the town. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unverified. While evidence confirms Israeli military presence in the region and incidents in Daraa province during the specified timeframe, there's no direct link to the image depicting Israeli forces entering Tasil. The provided sources, including reports from Asharq Al-Awsat and a map from Etana Syria ([https://etanasyria.org/syria-update-19-22-february-2025/](https://etanasyria.org/syria-update-19-22-february-2025/)), do not provide the necessary details to confirm the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence consistently points to reports and images related to the conflict between Israel and Gaza, with no mention of an earthquake in Israel in October 2024. The search results focus on the destruction of buildings, likely due to the conflict.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of supporting evidence.

The first memorials to the victims of the [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks")
 in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of [webmasters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/webmaster "wikt:webmaster")
 posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
 Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The first reading of the names of the victims of 9/11 took place at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2002.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Names-2)

The _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ was the first major physical memorial at the [World Trade Center site](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site "World Trade Center site")
. A permanent memorial and museum, the [National September 11 Memorial & Museum](/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum "National September 11 Memorial & Museum")
 at the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
, were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with 30-foot (9.1 m) waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials have been constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was [Pier A](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Pier_A_Park "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
 in [Hoboken, New Jersey](/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey "Hoboken, New Jersey")
. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called [Hoboken Island](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Hoboken_Island "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
, was chosen in September 2004.

_[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
_, the monumental and world's largest cast [bronze sculpture](/wiki/Bronze_sculpture "Bronze sculpture")
 of modern times created by German artist [Fritz Koenig](/wiki/Fritz_Koenig "Fritz Koenig")
 stood between the twin towers on the [Austin J. Tobin](/wiki/Austin_J._Tobin "Austin J. Tobin")
 Plaza of the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
 in New York City from 1971 until the terrorist attacks on [September 11, 2001](/wiki/September_11,_2001 "September 11, 2001")
. The artefact, weighing more than 20 tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers after the attacks. Since then, the bronze sphere, primarily known in the United States as _The Sphere_, has been transformed into a symbolic memorial to commemorate [9/11](/wiki/9/11 "9/11")
. Having become a major [tourist attraction](/wiki/Tourist_attraction "Tourist attraction")
, the unrestored sculpture was rededicated on August 16, 2017, by the [Port Authority](/wiki/Port_Authority_of_New_York_%26_New_Jersey "Port Authority of New York & New Jersey")

The [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
 was a temporary memorial at Ground Zero.

Soon after the attacks, temporary memorials were set up in New York and elsewhere.

*   On October 4, Reverend Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest, blessed the [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
    , two broken beams at the crash site which had formed a cross, and then had been welded together by iron-workers.
*   On October 13, the [North Charleston Coliseum](/wiki/North_Charleston_Coliseum "North Charleston Coliseum")
     raised a special banner featuring the retired number of [Mark Bavis](/wiki/Mark_Bavis "Mark Bavis")
    , who was on United Airlines Flight 175. Bavis had played for the ECHL's [South Carolina Stingrays](/wiki/South_Carolina_Stingrays "South Carolina Stingrays")
    , and his retired number hangs in a special corner, independently from the Stingrays' retired numbers (#14, #24) and awards banners (1997 and 2001 Kelly Cup Championships), with the years he played for the team (1994–96), the date of his death (September 11, 2001), and an American flag.
*   Also on October 13, The [September 11 Photo Project](/wiki/September_11_Photo_Project "September 11 Photo Project")
     was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community-based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historic preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled "The September 11 Photo Project" in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
*   On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture _[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
    _, formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in [Battery Park City](/wiki/Battery_Park_City "Battery Park City")
    .[\[3\]](#cite_note-Sphere-3)
    

#### In other countries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In other countries")\
\]

In Europe, annually a commemoration of September 11 to never forget, [Nissoria](/wiki/Nissoria "Nissoria")
 was one of the first public places that dedicated a memorial to September 11 in Europe. Nissoria is in a small town located in the Province of Enna in Sicily, Italy. Two family members of this community, Vincenzo DiFazio and Salvatore Lopez, died on Sept 11 at the World Trade Center.

The then-mayor Dr. Marco Murgo along with the Chiara family Benito Sr. and son Mario developed the project to dedicate a small plot of land adjacent to a local school and museum that was entitled “Parco 11 Settembre”. The Commanding Officer of the nearby U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella met with this delegation from Nissoria and embraced this truly heartfelt initiative.

Ever since its dedication, and thanks to the present-day Mayor of Nissoria Dott. Armando Glorioso and Dott. Alberto Lunetta who continues this important event, a representation of both American and Italian military personnel from the nearby Military base NAS Sigonella comes to visit and annually commemorate along with all local Italian Authorities, Dignitaries and citizens who truly will never forget this tragic event.

*   According to [Radio Farda](/wiki/Radio_Farda "Radio Farda")
    's website, when the attacks' news was released, Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news on Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, the [United States Department of State](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State")
    , published a post on its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
     After the attacks, the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran condemned the attacks. [BBC](/wiki/BBC "BBC")
     and [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")
     published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens on their websites.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for "learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future." The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor's POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)"To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001." (2)"To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered." (2)"To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: "This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them" The Flag of Heroes reads: " This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan's Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks.[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)
 The flags were also featured on [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")
's _[Today](/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program) "Today (American TV program)")
_[\[115\]](#cite_note-115)
 and on [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")
 affiliate [WVEC](/wiki/WVEC "WVEC")
 in Norfolk, Virginia.[\[116\]](#cite_note-116)

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

Virtual memorials
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Virtual memorials")\
\]

The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as _[Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life")
_ has led to the construction of permanent virtual memorials and exhibits. Examples include:

*   Celestial Requiem NYC (Second Life)[\[117\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-117)
     is a virtual recreation of a submitted physical memorial proposal:

> On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")
    .

9/11 Memorial in Israel

[![9/11 memorial in Israel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.israelpharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9-11-memorial.jpg)
We wanted to share something with you, something that is not widely known to many Americans (and not all Israeli’s either).  
In Israel we have a dedicated memorial to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Not only does it stand out poignantly on a hill in the middle of Israel, near Jerusalem, but the base is made out of 9/11 twin tower wreckage. It cost more than $2 million to make and was orchestrated by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).  
Unfortunately Israel knows how to build memorials and monuments. In this small country with so much turbulence, we know only too well the suffering of those who die needlessly in these terrorist attacks. This memorial is known simply as the “9/11 Memorial Plaza”.  
Here are some interesting facts about the 9/11 Memorial Plaza.

*   The memorial Plaza was completed in 2009 for $2 million, by the JNF.
*   It sits on 5 acres of hillside, 20 miles from the center of Jerusalem, not a small monument at all. It overlooks Jerusalem’s largest cemetery, Har HaMenuchot.
*   The memorial monument is in the shape of a 30-foot, bronze American flag that has been built in the shape of a flame to commemorate the flames of the Twin Towers.
*   The base is made out of melted twin tower wreckage.
*   Surrounding the main monument are plaques listing the names of all the people who died as a result of the attacks. Even though the memorial stands in Israel and only 5 Israel citizens died as a result of the attacks the memorial lists ALL the victims who perished. It is the only memorial outside the US which lists ALL of those who died in the attacks.

Times are turbulent and the entire Middle East is going through vast changes. Some say the relationship between the US and Israel is in trouble…… whatever happens, there will always be a special relationship between the US (in particular New York) and Israel.  
A powerful memorial… so the world never forgets.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The reverse image search and the image search results both identify the memorial. The geolocation data also supports this, indicating that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that this memorial is the only one outside the US. However, the provided evidence does not confirm or deny this statement. To verify this part of the claim, additional information about other 9/11 memorials outside the US would be needed.

Therefore, the claim is partially verified. The image does show the 9/11 memorial in Israel. However, the claim that it is the only one outside the US cannot be verified with the current evidence.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Therefore, the claim is partially verified. The image does show the 9/11 memorial in Israel. However, the claim that it is the only one outside the US cannot be verified with the current evidence.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:62>)
image_search("man rubble orange jacket")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:62>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a man in an orange jacket sitting in rubble, published by BuzzFeed News (<image:7822>). Another result from Freepik shows three men in orange jackets in a rubble area (<image:7823>). Additionally, there is a result showing an orange padded jacket (<image:7824>).


## Elaboration
The image search results show that the man in the orange jacket is in a rubble area. The image search also shows that the image was published by BuzzFeed News. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the location, the man's identity, or the circumstances surrounding the image.

The claim states that the image is from Gaza and depicts a man holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024. The evidence does not support this claim.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:62>)
image_search("man orange jacket rubble earthquake")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.8, 'Italy': 0.09, 'Albania': 0.01, 'Bulgaria': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Netherlands': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a man in an orange jacket sitting in rubble, related to the Turkey earthquake (<image:7830>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation analysis indicates a high probability that the image was taken in Turkey. Furthermore, the image search results show that the image is related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image shows a man from Gaza is therefore false.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:65>) appears in multiple articles discussing an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman. One article from Morocco World News ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/)) reports the incident occurred during a raid in the Jabalia refugee camp, causing severe injuries to the woman, Dawlat Al Tanani.

Another article from Ynetnews.com ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr)) states that the IDF refuted accusations, claiming the dog was abducted by Hamas. The article also mentions the image and includes images of the dog and the woman. An article from alestiklal.net ([https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians](https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians)) discusses the use of dogs by the Israeli army against Palestinians and includes the image (<image:65>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a Palestinian woman being attacked by a dog from China Daily ([https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm)) <image:7844>. Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)) <image:7845>.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/), [https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr), [https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians](https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians)) confirm the existence of the image and its association with an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman.

However, the claim's assertion of the image's authenticity is not explicitly confirmed. The evidence does not definitively state whether the image is a genuine photograph or a digitally altered depiction. The claim also specifies the event occurred in June 2024, which is consistent with the provided articles.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the image's authenticity needs further verification.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:65>)
image_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:65>) appears in multiple articles discussing an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman. One article from Morocco World News ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/)) reports the incident occurred during a raid in the Jabalia refugee camp, causing severe injuries to the woman, Dawlat Al Tanani.

Another article from Ynetnews.com ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr)) states that the IDF refuted accusations, claiming the dog was abducted by Hamas. The article also mentions the image and includes images of the dog and the woman. An article from alestiklal.net ([https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians](https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians)) discusses the use of dogs by the Israeli army against Palestinians and includes the image (<image:65>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a Palestinian woman being attacked by a dog from China Daily ([https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm)) <image:7844>. Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)) <image:7845>.

Additionally, Al-Haq's search result contains an image of a woman being attacked by a dog ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)) <image:7846>.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/), [https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr), [https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians](https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians)) confirm the existence of the image and its association with an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman.

However, the claim's assertion of the image's authenticity is not explicitly confirmed. The evidence does not definitively state whether the image is a genuine photograph or a digitally altered depiction. The claim also specifies the event occurred in June 2024, which is consistent with the provided articles.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the image's authenticity needs further verification.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image is associated with an incident involving an Israeli police dog and an elderly Palestinian woman. While the claim's context is supported by multiple sources, the image's authenticity is not explicitly confirmed.
