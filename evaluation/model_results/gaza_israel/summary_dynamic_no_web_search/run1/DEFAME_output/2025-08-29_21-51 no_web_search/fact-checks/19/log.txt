The claim '<image:16> This is an authentic image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu and Elon Musk during Netanyahu's official visit to the U.S. in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image in question (<image:16>) is likely AI-generated, as indicated by a LinkedIn post. While a reverse image search found the image on a website reporting on a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, the image's authenticity is questionable. Therefore, the claim that the image is authentic is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
