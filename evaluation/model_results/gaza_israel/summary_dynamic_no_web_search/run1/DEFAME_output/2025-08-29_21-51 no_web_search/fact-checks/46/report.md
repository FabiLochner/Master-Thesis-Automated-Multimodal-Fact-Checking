## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an announcement for a Bob Geldof tour in New Zealand in March 2025 ([https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/](https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/)) ![image 7577](media/2025-08-29_21-57-1756504655-035083.jpg). Additionally, there is an image from Getty Images of Bob Geldof and Bono from U2 on stage ([https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/stage-performance-concert-music-live-bob-geldof-u2](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/stage-performance-concert-music-live-bob-geldof-u2)) ![image 7578](media/2025-08-29_21-57-1756504655-291927.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence reveals a Bob Geldof tour in New Zealand in March 2025, but it does not mention any tour with U2. The Getty Images search result shows Bob Geldof and Bono on stage together, but this does not confirm a joint tour in November 2024.

The claim cannot be verified because there is no evidence of a U2 and Bob Geldof tour in November 2024. The evidence only shows a solo tour by Bob Geldof and a picture of him with Bono.

The claim also mentions that the tour was to aid the Israeli army, which is not supported by any of the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show a Bob Geldof tour in New Zealand in March 2025 and a picture of Bob Geldof and Bono on stage together. However, there is no evidence of a U2 and Bob Geldof tour in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsubstantiated. While there is evidence of a Bob Geldof tour in New Zealand in March 2025 ([https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/](https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/)) and a picture of Bob Geldof and Bono on stage ([https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/stage-performance-concert-music-live-bob-geldof-u2](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/stage-performance-concert-music-live-bob-geldof-u2)), there is no evidence of a joint tour by U2 and Bob Geldof in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army.
