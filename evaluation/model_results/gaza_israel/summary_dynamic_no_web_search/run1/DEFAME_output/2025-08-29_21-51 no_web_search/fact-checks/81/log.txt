The claim '<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. However, the claim that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is false, as multiple other memorials exist outside the United States, as evidenced by sources like Buzzfeed and memorialmapping.com.

So, the overall veracity is: false
