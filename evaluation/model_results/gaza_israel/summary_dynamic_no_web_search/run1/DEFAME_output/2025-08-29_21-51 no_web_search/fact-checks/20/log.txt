Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on January 30, 2025, stating that President Trump said his administration stopped a $50m plan to send condoms to Gaza. However, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, $83m was sent to two provinces in Mozambique, including one called Gaza, more than 6,000km away - not to Palestine. <image:7481>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-pulls-millions-funding-condoms-gaza-trump-admin-looks-trim-spending): 
Content: Fox News reports that the State Department pulled millions in funding for condoms in Gaza. <image:7486>

The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While the State Department pulled funding for condoms in Gaza, the initial funding was intended for a province in Mozambique, not Palestine, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims). The claim also incorrectly attributes the funding cut to DOGE.

So, the overall veracity is: false
