The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, stating "I hope that America obliterates Israel" cannot be verified. While evidence confirms Trump's use of Truth Social and an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, no evidence supports the specific post with the quoted statement.

So, the overall veracity is: false
