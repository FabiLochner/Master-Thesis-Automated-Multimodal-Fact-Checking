## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there was an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, and that the Los Angeles Times reported that at least 10 people were killed. However, the evidence does not mention the image of the child, nor does it mention the claim that 12 children playing soccer were murdered.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.
