## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources include articles about Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli Finance Minister. One article from Le Monde features a photograph of Smotrich. (![image 7348](media/2025-08-29_21-22-1756502567-277758.jpg)) The New York Times published an article on June 29, 2024, about Smotrich. (![image 7349](media/2025-08-29_21-22-1756502567-487652.jpg)) Bloomberg also contains an image of Bezalel Smotrich. (![image 7351](media/2025-08-29_21-22-1756502567-789209.jpg))

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. The search results provide images of Smotrich but do not provide any context about the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, I need to find information about the image's context, including the date and location, and confirm that it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack.

Insufficient information to verify the claim. The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister.
