Content: Reuters reports on a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu regarding a Gaza ceasefire deal. The article was published on August 15, 2024. <image:7607>

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu regarding a Gaza ceasefire deal around August 14, 2024, as reported by Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Trump's motivations were related to Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign.

So, the overall veracity is: false
