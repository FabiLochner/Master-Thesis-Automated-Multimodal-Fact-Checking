Content: The Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/middle-east_israeli-leaders-son-takes-center-stage-corruption-sagas/6192260.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/middle-east_israeli-leaders-son-takes-center-stage-corruption-sagas/6192260.html)) provides an image of Yair Netanyahu with his father <image:7760>.

The claim 'Netanyahu’s son Yair was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024 that targeted the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea, Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were reports of a drone attack and an assassination claim, subsequent searches did not confirm Yair Netanyahu's death. Images show him alive, and no credible sources support the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
