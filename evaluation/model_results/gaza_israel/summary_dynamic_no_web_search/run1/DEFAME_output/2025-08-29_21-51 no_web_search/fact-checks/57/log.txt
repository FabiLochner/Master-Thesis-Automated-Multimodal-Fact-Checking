The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-troops-expand-security-zone-northern-gaza-2025-04-04/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/at-least-27-killed-in-israeli-bombing-of-shelter-in-gaza-city-rescuers-say), and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo), there is no information available to confirm or deny the baby Sham Imad Muhareb's injury.

So, the overall veracity is: false
