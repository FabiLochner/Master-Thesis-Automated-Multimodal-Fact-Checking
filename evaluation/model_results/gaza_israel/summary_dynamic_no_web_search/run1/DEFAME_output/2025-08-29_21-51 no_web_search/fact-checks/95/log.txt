The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a man in Turkey, not Gaza, and is related to the Turkey earthquake, not an Israeli bombing, as evidenced by geolocation analysis and image search results, including a publication by The Guardian ([<image:7830>](<image:7830>)). Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
