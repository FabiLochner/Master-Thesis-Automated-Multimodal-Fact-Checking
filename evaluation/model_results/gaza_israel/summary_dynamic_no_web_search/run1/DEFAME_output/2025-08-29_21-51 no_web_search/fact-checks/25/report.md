## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on October 7, 2024, about Keir Starmer and the Middle East (![image 7499](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504522-439833.jpg)). Novara Media contains an image of Keir Starmer speaking at a podium with a flag of Israel in the background (![image 7500](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504522-745246.jpg)). The Times of Israel published an article about Keir Starmer and his stance on Gaza (![image 7501](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504522-874773.jpg)).

The provided sources are: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/07/starmer-urges-middle-east-step-back-from-brink-israel-gaza-anniversary), [Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2024/07/03/what-would-keir-starmer-as-prime-minister-mean-for-palestine/), and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/keir-starmers-centrism-on-gaza-alienates-some-labour-supporters/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Keir Starmer has been involved in discussions and has taken stances related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel. The images show him speaking about the Middle East and Gaza, but they do not confirm the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.


## Final Judgement
The search results show articles and images related to Keir Starmer and the Israel-Gaza conflict, but they do not provide evidence to support the claim that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results, including articles from The Guardian, Novara Media, and The Times of Israel, show Keir Starmer's involvement in discussions related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. However, none of the provided sources confirm that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024.
