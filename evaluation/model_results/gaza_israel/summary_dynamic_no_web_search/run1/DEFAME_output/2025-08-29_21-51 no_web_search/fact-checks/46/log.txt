The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there is evidence of a Bob Geldof tour in New Zealand in March 2025 ([https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/](https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/)) and a picture of Bob Geldof and Bono on stage ([https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/stage-performance-concert-music-live-bob-geldof-u2](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/stage-performance-concert-music-live-bob-geldof-u2)), there is no evidence of a joint tour by U2 and Bob Geldof in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army.

So, the overall veracity is: false
