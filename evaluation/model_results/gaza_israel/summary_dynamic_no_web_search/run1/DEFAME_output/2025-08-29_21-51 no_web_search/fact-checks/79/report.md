Content: The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats published a map showing attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon on September 22, 2024. ![image 2186](media/2025-07-20_11-03-1753009403-449690.jpg) The map shows that Lebanese Hezbollah conducted a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa.
