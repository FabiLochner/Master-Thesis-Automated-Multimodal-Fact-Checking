INFO: Dropping action 'reverse_search' as it was already performed.
No new actions were found in this response:

``` and performed actions: reverse_search(<image:48>), image_search("Ramat David airbase attack September 22 2024")
The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was an attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024)), the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase or that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah.

So, the overall veracity is: false
