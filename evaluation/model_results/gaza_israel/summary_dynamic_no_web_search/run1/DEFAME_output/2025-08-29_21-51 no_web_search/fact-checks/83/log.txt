Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/7/timeline-israels-attacks-on-gaza-since-2005): 
Content: Al Jazeera published a timeline of Israel's attacks on Gaza since 2005. The timeline includes military assaults in 2008-9, 2012, 2014, and 2021. <image:7789>

The claim '<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives. While the meeting did occur, it happened before September 2024, and the Gaza war was ongoing at the time, making the claim's specified date inaccurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
