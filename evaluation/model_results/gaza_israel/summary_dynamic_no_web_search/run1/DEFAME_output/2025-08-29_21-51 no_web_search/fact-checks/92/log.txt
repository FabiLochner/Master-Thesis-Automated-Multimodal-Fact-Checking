The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble after an earthquake in February 2023, as reported by [Enab Baladi](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/) and [UAE Times](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/). The claim misrepresents the image's context, incorrectly associating it with a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
