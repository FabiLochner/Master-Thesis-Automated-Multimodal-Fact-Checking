The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence indicates that Donald Trump signed executive orders and that there were actions related to UNRWA during his presidency. However, the fact-check did not find any evidence to confirm that Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, specifically halting all funding to UNRWA. While a [Los Angeles Times article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-20/trump-suspends-us-foreign-assistance-for-90-days-pending-reviews) mentions a suspension of U.S. foreign assistance on that date, it does not mention UNRWA funding.

So, the overall veracity is: false
