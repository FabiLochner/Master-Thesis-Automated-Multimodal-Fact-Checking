The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that the Huthi rebels were actively engaged in military operations in international waters in January 2024, as evidenced by an article from Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/houthis-attack-israel-linked-ships-in-red-sea-disrupting-trade)) detailing attacks on ships. This contradicts the claim that they ceased operations.

So, the overall veracity is: false
