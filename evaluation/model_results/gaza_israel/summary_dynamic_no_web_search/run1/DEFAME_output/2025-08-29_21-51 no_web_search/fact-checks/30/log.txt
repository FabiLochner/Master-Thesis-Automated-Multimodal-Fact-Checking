The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of BBC News coverage related to the Bibas family, the specific article title mentioned in the claim ("Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said") has not been found. The search results show a BBC News image of the Bibas family ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)), and other news articles about the family, but not the specific article mentioned in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
