The claim 'In March 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested and detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While multiple news sources confirm the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil in March 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were involved in the arrest, nor does it verify his status as a lawful permanent resident.

So, the overall veracity is: false
