The claim 'Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The evidence, including reports from Livemint ([https://www.livemint.com/news/irans-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-killed-in-israeli-strike-reports-say-who-was-he-11749833415067.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/irans-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-killed-in-israeli-strike-reports-say-who-was-he-11749833415067.html)), indicates claims of Esmail Qaani's death in an Israeli strike, and there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
