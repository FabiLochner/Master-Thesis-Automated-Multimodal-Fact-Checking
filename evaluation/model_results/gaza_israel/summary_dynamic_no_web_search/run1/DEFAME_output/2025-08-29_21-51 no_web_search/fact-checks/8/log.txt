The claim '<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. While evidence confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/26/condemnation-calls-for-restraint-world-reacts-to-israeli-strikes-on-iran), the image in question has not been definitively linked to these attacks.

So, the overall veracity is: false
