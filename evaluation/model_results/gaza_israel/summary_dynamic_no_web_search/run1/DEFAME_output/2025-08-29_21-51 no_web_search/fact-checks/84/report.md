## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
reverse_search(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
image_search("Benjamin Netanyahu house drone")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) is of Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea. The image predates the claim and was featured in a 2020 article by _Times of Israel_ and a YouTube video from 2019.

The image was found on the website [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7) and on the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Aviationist reports on an attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house (![image 7790](media/2025-08-29_22-03-1756505031-646600.jpg)). The Australian reports that a Hezbollah drone cracked a bedroom window at Netanyahu's home (![image 7791](media/2025-08-29_22-03-1756505033-835313.jpg)). Siasat.com reports that a Hezbollah drone filmed Benjamin Netanyahu's residence (![image 7792](media/2025-08-29_22-03-1756505034-355224.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image predates the claim and was featured in a 2020 article and a 2019 YouTube video. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it was taken before August 2024. The claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it predates the claim, appearing in a 2020 article by _Times of Israel_ and a 2019 YouTube video, thus disproving the assertion that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.
