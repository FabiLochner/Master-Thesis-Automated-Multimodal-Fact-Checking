Content: AppleInsider published an article on November 14, 2018, about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1. <image:6463>

The claim '<image:31> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts an exploded iPhone, and while there are documented cases of iPhones exploding, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image is related to pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024. The search results show other instances of exploded iPhones, such as the one reported on the Apple Support Communities website and the one reported by the Free Press Journal, but none of them are related to the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
