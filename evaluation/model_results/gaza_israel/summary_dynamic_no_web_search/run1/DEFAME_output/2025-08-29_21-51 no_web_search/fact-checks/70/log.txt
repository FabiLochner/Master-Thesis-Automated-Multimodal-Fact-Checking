Content: Al Jazeera states that Israel claims the Iron Dome is 90 percent effective. <image:7737>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20385306): 
Content: The BBC provides an image explaining how the Iron Dome defense system works (<image:7738>). The article does not mention the interception rate of ballistic missiles.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/iran-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-air-defence/104420966): 
Content: ABC News published an article on October 2, 2024, about the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel, including an image of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles (<image:7741>).

The claim 'The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially verified. While the Iron Dome is a functional missile defense system with a claimed 90% effectiveness rate, the provided evidence, including articles from [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/12/whats-the-israel-iron-dome-defence-system-and-is-it-effective-all-to-know) and [ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/iran-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-air-defence/104420966), does not confirm this specific rate for the October 1, 2024, attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
