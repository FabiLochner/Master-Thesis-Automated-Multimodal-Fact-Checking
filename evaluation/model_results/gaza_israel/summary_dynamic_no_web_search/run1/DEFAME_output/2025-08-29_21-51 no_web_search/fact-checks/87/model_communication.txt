A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:57>)
image_search("Esmail Qaani hijab")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an article titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" which references an image of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, in civilian disguise. The article suggests this was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025. The post includes the image in question <image:57> and discusses the context of Qaani's role and potential evasion strategies. The post also includes a link to an X post by @MOSSADil. The forum also contains multiple comments on the topic.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor published an image of Esmail Qaani. (<image:7800>) The Times of Israel published an article with an image of a woman holding a picture of Iranian leaders. (<image:7801>) Fox News provides an image of Esmail Qaani. (<image:7802>)

The provided sources do not contain the image in the claim (<image:57>).


## Elaboration
The image search results do not confirm the claim. However, the reverse image search found the image on a Nigerian forum, which discusses an article about Esmail Qaani in disguise. The article suggests this was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm the image's authenticity.


## Actions
```
image_search("Esmail Qaani disguise")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about Esmail Qaani, including an image of him. <image:7803> Newsweek published an article about Esmail Qaani. <image:7807> The other source did not provide any content.


## Elaboration
The image search results do not provide any additional information to verify the claim. The evidence suggests that the image is likely authentic, but there is no direct confirmation.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Esmail Qaani in public")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Shafaq.com published an article about Esmail Qaani's first public appearance (<image:7813>). Ynetnews.com published an image of Esmail Qaani in public (<image:7814>). The other source did not provide any content.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Esmail Qaani has been seen in public. However, none of the images from the search results match the image in the claim. The claim's veracity cannot be confirmed.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The reverse image search found the image on a forum discussing an article about Esmail Qaani in disguise. The article suggests this was a survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. However, the image search results do not provide any additional information to verify the claim.

Based on the available evidence, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed. While the reverse image search suggests the image's existence in a relevant context, there is no direct confirmation of its authenticity or the specific circumstances described in the claim. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unproven. While a reverse image search found the image on a forum discussing Esmail Qaani in disguise, suggesting its potential authenticity, the image search results did not provide any additional information to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation analysis indicates a high probability that the image was taken in Turkey. Furthermore, the image search results show that the image is related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image shows a man from Gaza is therefore false.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:62>)
image_search("man rubble orange jacket")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:62>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a man in an orange jacket sitting in rubble, published by BuzzFeed News (<image:7822>). Another result from Freepik shows three men in orange jackets in a rubble area (<image:7823>). Additionally, there is a result showing an orange padded jacket (<image:7824>).


## Elaboration
The image search results show that the man in the orange jacket is in a rubble area. The image search also shows that the image was published by BuzzFeed News. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the location, the man's identity, or the circumstances surrounding the image.

The claim states that the image is from Gaza and depicts a man holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024. The evidence does not support this claim.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:62>)
image_search("man orange jacket rubble earthquake")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.8, 'Italy': 0.09, 'Albania': 0.01, 'Bulgaria': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Netherlands': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a man in an orange jacket sitting in rubble, related to the Turkey earthquake (<image:7830>

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation analysis indicates a high probability that the image was taken in Turkey. Furthermore, the image search results show that the image is related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image shows a man from Gaza is therefore false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is of a man in Turkey, not Gaza. The image is related to the Turkey earthquake, not an Israeli bombing. The claim is therefore demonstrably false. `false`

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/), [https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr), [https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians](https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians)) confirm the existence of the image and its association with an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman.

However, the claim's assertion of the image's authenticity is not explicitly confirmed. The evidence does not definitively state whether the image is a genuine photograph or a digitally altered depiction. The claim also specifies the event occurred in June 2024, which is consistent with the provided articles.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the image's authenticity needs further verification.

Multiple sources ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/), [https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr), [https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians](https://www.alestiklal.net/en/article/how-does-israeli-occupation-employ-dogs-to-humiliate-and-oppress-palestinians)) confirm the existence of the image and its association with an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman.

However, the claim's assertion of the image's authenticity is not explicitly confirmed. The evidence does not definitively state whether the image is a genuine photograph or a digitally altered depiction. The claim also specifies the event occurred in June 2024, which is consistent with the provided articles.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the image's authenticity needs further verification.


# Your Judgement

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:65>) appears in multiple articles discussing an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman. One article from Morocco World News ([https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/)) reports the incident occurred during a raid in the Jabalia refugee camp, causing severe injuries to the woman, Dawlat Al Tanani.

Another article from Ynetnews.com ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryura55lr)) states that the IDF refuted accusations, claiming the dog was abducted by Hamas. The article also mentions the image and includes images of the dog and the woman.
