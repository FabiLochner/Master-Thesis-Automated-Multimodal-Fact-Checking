## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a Maersk Line vessel (![image 7475](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504460-868586.jpg)) and an image of a ship on fire with a Twitter post reporting a US-flagged ship targeted in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024 (![image 7476](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504461-933074.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that a US-flagged ship was targeted in the Gulf of Aden. The image search results include a Twitter post from July 9, 2024, reporting such an attack. The image shows a ship on fire. However, the provided evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the information about the Maersk spokesperson is missing.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that a US-flagged ship was targeted in the Gulf of Aden. However, the provided evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson.

Since the claim includes information that is not supported by the evidence, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. An image search revealed a Twitter post reporting an attack on a US-flagged ship in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024, as shown in the search results (![image 7476](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504461-933074.jpg)). However, the evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson, making the claim false.
