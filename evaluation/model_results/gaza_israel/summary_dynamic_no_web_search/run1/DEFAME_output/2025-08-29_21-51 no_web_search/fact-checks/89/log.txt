The claim 'For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not fully verifiable. While reports confirm the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and his use of WhatsApp, there is no evidence from sources like the [Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media), [WHYY.org](https://whyy.org/articles/hamas-ismail-haniyeh-assassination-israel-strike-iran/), or [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-reportedly-assassinated-tehran-00172019) to support the assertion that Israeli intelligence tracked him through WhatsApp.

So, the overall veracity is: false
