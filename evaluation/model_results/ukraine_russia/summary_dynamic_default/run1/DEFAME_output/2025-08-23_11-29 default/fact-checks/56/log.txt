Useful result: From [Source](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65111956/): 
Content: The search result from IMDB, published on February 6, 2025, by Tom Tapp, discusses a video alleging that USAID spent $4 million to send Ben Stiller to Ukraine. Ben Stiller refuted the claim, stating that the trip was self-funded and that there was no funding from USAID. <image:17>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-totally-false-actor-ben-stiller-debunks-claims-usaid-funded-ukraine-trip-231285317684): 
Content: MSNBC's "Morning Joe" published an article titled "'Totally false': Actor Ben Stiller debunks claims USAID funded Ukraine trip". The article debunks a claim, amplified by Elon Musk, that Stiller and other actors were paid millions by USAID for trips to Ukraine. <image:17>

The claim '<image:17> This image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, for which Stiller received $4 million from USAID.' is false.
Justification: The image accurately depicts Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting on June 20, 2022, as confirmed by sources like [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/world/ben-stiller-to-zelensky-youre-my-hero/2022/06/20/d15f1fcb-da3a-4847-a0e0-e00b22625396_video.html). However, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is false, as reported by [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65111956/), and [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-totally-false-actor-ben-stiller-debunks-claims-usaid-funded-ukraine-trip-231285317684), which state that Stiller self-funded the trip.

So, the overall veracity is: false
