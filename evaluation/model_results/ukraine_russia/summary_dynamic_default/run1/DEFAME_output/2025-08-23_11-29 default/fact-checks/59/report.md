### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article from July 21, 2023, reports on an FBI document detailing an allegation that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm, but there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Euronews, updated on 15/01/2025, discusses old false claims about Ukrainian kickbacks to US politicians.
