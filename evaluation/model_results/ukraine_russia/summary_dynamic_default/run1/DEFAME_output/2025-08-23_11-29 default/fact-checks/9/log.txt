Content: The article from Telegrafi.com discusses a rare trip of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky outside of Kyiv, where he visited the front line in the Kharkiv region and met with Ukrainian troops. The article includes an image of Zelensky with soldiers, which is the same as <image:7>. The article was published 3 years ago. <image:1662> is the same as <image:7>.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the search results confirm that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and that Zelensky was present in the area, the context of the image is not confirmed. The evidence does not verify that the image depicts Zelensky arriving in Sudzha or meeting with representatives of the people there.
