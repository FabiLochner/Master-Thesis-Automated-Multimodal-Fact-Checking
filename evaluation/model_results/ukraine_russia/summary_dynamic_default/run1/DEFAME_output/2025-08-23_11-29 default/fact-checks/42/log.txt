Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/): 
Content: The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine. The audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies. The audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. The DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)". The release date is not mentioned.

Content: The search result is a fact sheet from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) dated February 8, 2024, which addresses claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> and <image:3836>. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. The fact sheet also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal details allegations of corruption and investigations involving Hunter Biden and Burisma Holdings. It also mentions concerns about the withholding of military aid and the role of Giuliani in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The article does not provide any information about current U.S. aid to Ukraine or money laundering.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973): 
Content: The BBC News reported on January 28, 2024, that Ukraine's security service uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m). The SBU said five senior people in the defense ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated. The officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided. <image:4464>, <image:4465>.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. The AP interview with Zelenskyy, as reported by the [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14), does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, such as the one reported by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973), this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.

So, the overall veracity is: false
