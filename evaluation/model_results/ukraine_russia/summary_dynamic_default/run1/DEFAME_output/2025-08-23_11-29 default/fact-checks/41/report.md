## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an Al Jazeera article, PolitiFact fact-checked Donald Trump's claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the war in Ukraine, stating that Russia launched an invasion on February 24, 2022 (<image:k>). The Wikipedia article on the Russian invasion of Ukraine also states that the conflict began on February 24, 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine (<image:k>).

VOA News reports that the Russian Ambassador to the UK falsely claimed that Zelenskyy started the Russia-Ukraine war, stating that the conflict began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine (![image 2119](media/2025-08-07_19-49-1754596191-724117.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the 2022 war in Ukraine began with Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022. PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim and found it false. The Russian Ambassador to the UK falsely claimed that Zelenskyy started the war, but the conflict began in 2014.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim that Zelenskyy started the 2022 war is not supported.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including PolitiFact and Wikipedia, indicates that Russia initiated the 2022 war in Ukraine. The claim that Zelenskyy started the war is false, as the conflict began with Russia's invasion.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including an Al Jazeera article and Wikipedia, confirm that Russia initiated the 2022 war in Ukraine with its invasion on February 24, 2022, not Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
