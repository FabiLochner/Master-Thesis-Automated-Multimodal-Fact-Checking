The Tasnim News Agency reported on January 12, 2025, that Maria Zakharova commented on the California wildfires. The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMFUS) published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing how Russian state-affiliated accounts leveraged the California wildfires to sow division. NPR published an article on January 16, 2025, stating that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires.
