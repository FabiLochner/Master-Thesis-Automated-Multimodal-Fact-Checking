## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results confirm the existence of the Hull Daily Mail on March 13, 2025. One source, a library record, provides details about the publication date. Another source, from mythdetector.com, states that the image of the Hull Daily Mail frontpage is falsified, and the actual issue does not mention Ukraine. The front page of the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, includes the headline "BOY FOUND GUILTY OF ATTEMPTING TO MURDER GIRL WITH A SWORD" (![image 73](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501202-576951.jpg)).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources debunk a fake Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, which claimed that 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers died in the Kursk region. The article from Gwara Media ([Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/)) states that the fake cover was spread on Telegram channels and other pro-Russian sources.

The Journal.ie ([Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/)) also debunks the image, stating that the real front page had a different headline. The articles were published on March 28, 2025, and March 26, 2025, respectively. ![image 1451](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573946-256635.jpg) ![image 1454](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573951-547510.jpg) ![image 1470](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574071-817295.jpg) ![image 1471](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574072-732356.jpg) ![image 1472](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574075-181803.jpg)
