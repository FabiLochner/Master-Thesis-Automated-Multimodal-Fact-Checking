## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan provided to the Ukrainian government in late 2024. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) mentions that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

The CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg) The Trump administration announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided significant military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the specific amount of $350 billion as of February 2025. One source mentions approximately $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). Another source mentions a $20 billion loan in late 2024 ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)). The evidence also mentions weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined due to the lack of specific data on the total military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025. The provided evidence does not include the exact amount.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence does not support the claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The search results mention different amounts and types of aid, but not the specific amount stated in the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, the provided sources, including those from the Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)), do not corroborate the specific amount of $350 billion as of February 2025.
