## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) reported on Poland's military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of the annual Armed Forces Day observances in Warsaw. The parade showcased Poland's growing army and modern equipment. The Polish Radio website ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)) also reported on the parade, which took place on August 15, 2024, as part of a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17. The parade included military hardware, such as K2 battle tanks, Krab self-propelled gun-howitzers, and M1A1 Abrams tanks.

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland))) discusses Armed Forces Day in Poland, celebrated annually on August 15th, commemorating the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia. The day is marked by military parades and equipment reviews. ![image 25](media/77.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade was a showcase of military equipment, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration that started on August 14.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia. The evidence confirms a parade took place on August 15, 2024, and the celebrations started on August 14. The evidence does not mention the parade being a preparation for war with Russia.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event but lacks evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations, which started on August 14. The claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event, but the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations, which began on August 14, as reported by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) and Polish Radio ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)). While the claim correctly identifies the event as a military parade, there is no evidence to support the assertion that it was a preparation for war with Russia.
