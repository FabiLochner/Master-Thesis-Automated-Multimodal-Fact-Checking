### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 24, 2025, Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump held a press conference at the White House, as reported by [Roll Call](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025) and [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-macron-corrects-trump-after-he-says-european-support-for-ukraine-was-a-loan). Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/](https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/)) also reported on the meeting, stating that Macron said Russia "is the aggressor" in the conflict.

The transcript from Roll Call does not contain the phrase "butcher" or any direct quotes from Macron referring to Putin.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. According to Yahoo News UK ([https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html)), Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during the press conference with Trump on February 24, 2025.

The press conference did take place on the specified date, as confirmed by multiple sources, including Roll Call ([https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-emmanuel-macron-france-february-24-2025)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/](https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/)). However, the transcript from Roll Call does not contain the phrase "butcher" or any direct quotes from Macron referring to Putin.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that a press conference between Macron and Trump occurred on February 24, 2025. However, multiple sources, including Yahoo News UK, state that Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during this press conference.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is directly contradicted by evidence from reliable sources. `false`
