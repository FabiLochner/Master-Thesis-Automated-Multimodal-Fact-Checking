## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including StopFake.org, Detector Media, and Kalkine Media, have fact-checked the quote attributed to Claudia Sheinbaum and found it to be fabricated. Sheinbaum did decline an invitation to visit Ukraine, but the derogatory statement about Zelenskyy is disinformation.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum made a derogatory statement about Volodymyr Zelenskyy is demonstrably false. Fact-checkers have identified the quote as fabricated, and the claim is therefore not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum made a derogatory statement about Volodymyr Zelenskyy is false. While she did decline an invitation to visit Ukraine, the quote attributed to her has been debunked as disinformation by fact-checkers such as [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-mexican-president-refuses-to-visit-ukraine-calling-zelensky-a-drug-addict/) and [Detector Media](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/disinformation-spread-online-that-the-mexican-president-refused-to-come-to-ukraine-calling-zelenskyi-a-drug-addict).
