Content: The search result from Houston Public Media states that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires. The claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel.

Content: The Forbes article, published on January 13, 2025, discusses claims made on social media and a Russian Telegram channel that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires. The article states that there is zero evidence to support this claim and that the original post was satire, but subsequent reposts lacked any mention of it being a joke. The article also mentions that Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, was named as one of the individuals who supposedly lost their homes. <image:2342>
