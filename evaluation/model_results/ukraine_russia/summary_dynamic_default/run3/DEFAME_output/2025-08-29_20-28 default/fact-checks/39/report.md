### Evidence from `web_search`
According to [Latin Times](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436), Infowars reporter Jamie White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, and Alex Jones claimed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The Austin police confirmed White was shot in his apartment complex parking lot. ![image 5696](media/2025-08-29_20-34-1756499678-120285.jpg)

[StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/) states that White was murdered on March 9, and his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The article claims there is no evidence that White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine." [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418) reports that Alex Jones claimed White was on a Ukrainian "hit list" and that the Austin Police Department stated White was shot and killed in his apartment's parking lot on March 9, likely due to a car robbery. ![image 5729](media/2025-08-29_20-35-1756499705-665834.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Jamie White, an InfoWars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones claimed that White was on a Ukrainian "hit list." However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The Austin Police Department stated that White was likely killed during a car robbery.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list after being shot dead is not supported by evidence. While Alex Jones made this claim, there is no evidence to back it up. The Austin Police Department stated that White was likely killed during a car robbery.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list after being shot dead is not supported by evidence. While the InfoWars reporter was shot dead in Austin, Texas, and Alex Jones made the claim, there is no evidence to support it, and the Austin Police Department suggested the murder was related to a car robbery, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418).
