### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Donald Trump criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Truth Social for suggesting the war against Russia would continue for some time (![image 1567](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592628-069882.jpg)). NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, discussing a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office (![image 1572](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592644-705128.jpg), ![image 1569](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592639-153450.jpg), ![image 1570](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592640-602508.jpg)). Trump criticized Zelenskyy's gratitude for U.S. support and later posted on Truth Social that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Reuters published an article on February 19, 2025, reporting on the feud between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator" and Zelenskyy accused Trump of parroting Russian disinformation (![image 1573](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592657-229427.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about Volodymyr Zelenskyy blocking access to Donald Trump's Truth Social platform in Ukraine. The provided articles discuss Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy on Truth Social and a contentious meeting between the two leaders. However, there is no mention of Zelenskyy taking any action to block the platform.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Trump and Zelenskyy were in conflict and used Truth Social to communicate, but there is no evidence that Zelenskyy blocked access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The available evidence, including articles from PBS News, NPR, and Reuters, indicates a feud between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with Trump criticizing Zelenskyy on Truth Social. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy blocked access to Trump's Truth Social platform in Ukraine.
