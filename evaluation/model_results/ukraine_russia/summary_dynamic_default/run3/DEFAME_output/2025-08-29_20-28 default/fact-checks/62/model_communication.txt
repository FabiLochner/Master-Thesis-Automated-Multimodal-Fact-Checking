FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

### News Release

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. "These strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders," Eastburn said.

Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation."

Houthi supporters chant slogans during a weekly, anti-US and anti-Israel rally in Sanaa, Yemen, on April 18.

CNN  — 

In the month since the US launched a major military campaign targeting the [Houthi rebel group in Yemen](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/middleeast/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthis-may-be-relishing-them-intl/index.html)
, the militants have successfully shot down at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones, hindering the US’ ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, multiple US officials familiar with the matter told CNN.

The US was hoping to achieve air superiority over Yemen within 30 days, officials said and degrade Houthi air defense systems enough to begin a new phase focusing on ramping up intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance of senior Houthi leaders in order to target and kill them, the officials said.

But the platforms best suited to conduct that persistent effort, the MQ9 Reaper drones, keep getting shot down, the officials explained. These assessments were largely based on signals intelligence, one of the people said.

![Yemenis watch a damaged vehicle at Farwah popular market which Houthis said it was struck by US airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, on April 21.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap25111262672128.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Asked for comment about the downed drones and whether it has negatively impacted the operation, a defense official told CNN in a statement that “we are aware of the Houthi reports these MQ-9s have been shot down. The strikes have forced the Houthis to stay underground more and left them in a “confused and disarrayed state,” the officials noted.

But the consistent loss of the drones has made it more difficult for the US to determine precisely how much the US has degraded the Houthis’ weapons stockpiles.

Over the last six weeks, the Houthis have launched 77 one-way attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, 24 medium-range ballistic missiles, and 23 surface-to-air missiles either at US forces, into the Red Sea, or at Israel, two of the officials said.

The intelligence community has also assessed in recent days that over nearly six weeks of US bombing, the Houthis’ ability and intent to keep lobbing missiles at US and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and at Israel is little changed, as is their command-and-control structure, according to two other people familiar with the intelligence. Trump posted on X in March that the Houthis “have been decimated” and their capabilities “are rapidly being destroyed.”

While Eastburn provided additional data on Thursday regarding the impact of US strikes, US Central Command has been largely silent about the impact, however, even as it routinely shares photos and videos on its X account of missiles firing off of warships or US aircraft preparing to launch off aircraft carriers in the Red Sea. The US does not have boots on the ground in Yemen, so it relies on overhead surveillance — much of it from the MQ9s—to conduct battlefield damage assessments and track terrorists.

CNN [reported earlier this month](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 that the US had killed several Houthi officials considered to be mid-level, akin to “middle management,” rather than senior political leadership.

The officials said the US had hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15. “Additionally, Houthi ballistic missile launches have dropped by 87% while attacks from their one-way drones have decreased by 65% since the beginning of these operations.”

The administration is vowing to continue with the campaign until the Houthis can no longer attack Red Sea shipping. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson [last month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/text-of-a-letter-from-the-president-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-and-the-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate/)
, President Donald Trump said the operations would continue “until the Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.”

But the Houthis have long proven to be extremely resilient, burying their equipment deep underground and continuing to receive supplies from Iran. The Pentagon has also not addressed claims by the Houthis that the airstrikes have killed dozens of civilians.

In a rare update, CENTCOM said last week that it had destroyed a port in Yemen that the Houthis were using to import oil and fuel their attacks. But the impact of that on the Houthis’ operations similarly remains unclear.

One of the US officials who spoke to CNN left the door open for a continuous campaign in support of US partners in the Gulf region against the Houthis, similar to how the US operates in Africa.

The costs of the campaign, meanwhile, are only rising. The operation [cost the US nearly $1 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 in just the first three weeks, and the US has continued striking Houthi targets daily for over a month.

The large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who CNN has reported had complained in recent weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM that would be critical in the event of a war with China.

“We have to maintain a high state of indications and warning so we can get those forces back if there is a crisis with greater exigence than there is one in the CENTCOM (area of responsibility),” US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm."

The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025. NPR and CNN report that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The US launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone or that Russian missiles were used.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the timeframe and the involvement of the Houthis and US drones, but the image's content and the use of Russian missiles are not verified.

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

French President Emmanuel Macron Olivier Hoslet / Pool / EPA / TASS

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober."

### **“Going to die anyway”**

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. <image:1440>\

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Similar content that purported to show the famous monument on fire [reportedly went viral](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/hollywood-sign-not-affected-by-los-angeles-wildfires-2025-01-09/)
 across multiple social media platforms. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. Some accounts amplified content that reinforced this narrative, including a [misleading video,](https://anlatilaninotesi.com.tr/20250109/los-angeles-itfaiyesinden-yangina-kadin-cantali-mudahale-1092506772.html)
 later [debunked](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/los-angeles-firefighters-did-not-use-handbags-douse-fire-2025-01-10/)
 by Reuters, that purported to show firefighters resorting to fighting fires with “women’s handbags”. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts."

The story that initially circulated was debunked by professional fact checkers from [Greece](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)
, which has been associated with prior Russian information operations, then translates and distributes the Telegram posts.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

CNN  — 

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday [officially denied](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/politics/spartz-mccarthy-democrats-committees/index.html)
 seats on the House Intelligence Committee to Democratic Reps. Integrity matters more,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that he [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154?s=20&t=d-aUU6NhKX5LawVEJvU2nA)
 Tuesday night.

McCarthy has cited a “new standard” from Democrats for why he would strip Schiff and Swalwell, both of California, of their committee assignments. “It’s too bad because that committee has always been a bipartisan committee, and he’s taking one of the most precious pieces of glassware in the congressional cabinet and smashing it, and the damage is going to be irreparable.”

He added that “if a Democrat advocated for violence against another member of Congress, I would support getting rid of them.”

Schiff told reporters that “if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from vigorously pushing back against his efforts to tear down these institutions, he’s going to find out just how wrong he is.”

“I think this is a terrible move on his part and once again, showing McCarthy just catering to the most extreme elements of this conference,” he added.

Schiff will sit on the Judiciary Committee, according to a Democratic aide, while Swalwell told CNN he will sit on the Judiciary and Homeland Security panels.

Some House Republicans have criticized McCarthy’s move ejecting Democrats from the intelligence panel. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said in a statement that she opposes the push to remove the Democrats.

“I appreciate these Republican members speaking out against what McCarthy is doing,” Schiff later told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.”

“I think it does show that there are Republicans who understand this is very ill considered. Indeed, the opposition to it is bipartisan.”

The three Democrats whom McCarthy ousted or plan to oust stood in unity at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday.

“The three of us have chosen to stick together because this isn’t about any individual committee assignments, and this is about an institution where the speaker of the House is using his power to go after his political opponents, and to pick them off the field,” Swalwell said.

They all seemed in agreement that the “destructive move” was especially hypocritical, given embattled Rep. Democrats and Republicans have called on Santos, a freshman Republican from New York, to resign following a series of false statements he has made including misrepresenting parts of his identity and his resume.

“This is a Republican speaker who is seating a human fraud, George Santos, on committees, a serial fabricator about every part of his existence. He’s perfectly comfortable with it,” Schiff said.

Rep. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell accused House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of "political vengeance" for blocking the California Democrats from serving on the House Intelligence Committee.

"This is, I think, not an unexpected but nonetheless, destructive move by Kevin McCarthy," Schiff said during a press conference Wednesday morning.

McCarthy rejected a request from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to keep Schiff and Swalwell on the committee. 6 attack on the Capitol.

In [a letter to Jeffries](https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154)
, McCarthy said the intel committee under Schiff "severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions — ultimately leaving our nation less safe." On Tuesday, McCarthy cited a report that Swalwell was [targeted by a Chinese spy in 2014](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/18/948210355/fbi-briefs-reps-pelosi-mccarthy-on-rep-swalwells-ties-to-suspected-chinese-spy)
.

"Those members will have other committees, but the intel committee is different. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., center, with Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., center, with Rep. Both members previously served on the panel — with Schiff serving as chair from 2019 to 2022 — and both were involved in the investigations and impeachments of former President Donald Trump.

The move comes as the new Republican majority is outlining its plans and priorities for the session, which include a focus on oversight and investigations of President Biden's administration.

As House speaker, McCarthy has authority to approve or reject spots on the intelligence committee because it is a "select" committee, while positions on standing committees ultimately require a vote of the House. Republicans who support the move cited former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's [refusal to seat several members to the select committee](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1018850848/pelosi-rejects-2-gop-nominees-for-the-jan-6-panel-citing-integrity-of-the-probe)
 investigating the Jan. The intel committee's responsibility is national security to America," he said.

Under new Republican leadership, the House Intelligence Committee is expected to investigate the [classified documents](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/21/1150617734/the-doj-searched-bidens-home-and-found-more-classified-documents)

### Schiff told reporters Tuesday he thinks the move is purely political

While McCarthy argues blocking Schiff and Swalwell is in the interest of national security, Democrats say the move is nothing more than political retribution.

"His objection seems to be that I was the lead impeachment manager in Donald Trump's first impeachment, and that we held him accountable for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid from Ukraine," Schiff said. "So he is now, I think, carrying the dirty water for the former president in trying to remove me from the intel committee."

But, Schiff added, "if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from holding him accountable, holding Donald Trump accountable or any of the extreme elements of his conference, he's wrong."

Schiff is now slated to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, according to a source familiar with the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly.

McCarthy is also considering a vote to block Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from sitting on the Foreign Affairs Committee over her [comments on Israel](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/07/700901834/minnesota-congresswoman-ignites-debate-on-israel-and-anti-semitism)

Content: "But the GOP resolution would also launch an ethics investigation into Schiff’s conduct.

While Schiff did not initiate the 2017 congressional investigation into Trump’s Russia ties — then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican who later became one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, started it — Republicans arguing in favor of his censure Wednesday blamed him for what they said was the fallout of that probe, and of the separate investigation started that same year by Trump’s own Justice Department.

Luna said that Schiff’s comments that there was evidence against Trump “ripped apart American families across the country” and that he was “permanently destroying family relationships.” Several blamed him for the more than $30 million spent by then-special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the Justice Department probe.

Schiff said the censure resolution “would accuse me of omnipotence, the leader of some a vast Deep State conspiracy, and of course, it is nonsense.”

Democrats aggressively defended their colleague. Several of the Republicans who voted to block the resolution last week said they opposed fining a member of Congress in that manner.

The final vote on Wednesday was 213-209 along party lines, with a handful of members voting present.

The revised resolution says Schiff held positions of power during Trump’s presidency and “abused this trust by saying there was evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia.” Schiff was one of the most outspoken critics of the former president as both the Justice Department and the Republican-led House launched investigations into Trump’s ties to Russia in 2017.

 for comments he made several years ago about investigations into Donald Trump’s ties to Russia, rebuking the Democrat and frequent critic of the former president along party lines.

Schiff becomes the 25th House lawmaker to be censured. Schiff over Trump-Russia investigations](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-rejects-effort-to-censure-and-fine-democrat-rep-schiff-over-trump-russia-investigations)

Schiff, the former Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment trial, has long been a top Republican political target. Soon after taking back the majority this year, Republicans blocked him from sitting on the intelligence panel.

More than 20 Republicans voted with Democrats last week to block the censure resolution, but they changed their votes this week after the measure’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, removed a provision that could have fined Schiff $16 million if the House Ethics Committee determined he lied. Both investigations concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential election but neither found evidence of a criminal conspiracy.

“Representative Schiff purposely deceived his Committee, Congress, and the American people,” the resolution said.

Mueller, who led the two-year Justice Department investigation, determined that Russia intervened on the campaign’s behalf and that Trump’s campaign welcomed the help. But Mueller’s team did not find that the campaign conspired to sway the election, and the Justice Department did not recommend any criminal charges.

The House intelligence committee probe launched by Nunes similarly found that Russia intervened in the election but that there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy. Republicans are trying to show their fealty to Trump, Schiff said.

He said he warned the country during impeachment proceedings three years ago that Trump “would go on to do worse."

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Putin’s Real _Casus Belli_: Ukrainian Democracy

Amazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break Ukraine’s democracy.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump.

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other...

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

The session revealed deep divisions within the GOP on U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (R) looks on as U.S. [Mitch McConnell](https://kyivindependent.com/mcconnells-exit-signals-shift-in-republican-support-for-ukraine/)
 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

Intelligence about the depot's munitions, its vulnerabilities, and nearby Russian defensive systems was provided to Ukraine by the [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
. The depot reportedly stored not only artillery shells, but also [Iskander](/wiki/Iskander "Iskander")
 missiles, [Tochka-U](/wiki/Tochka-U "Tochka-U")
 ballistic missiles and [glide bombs](/wiki/Glide_bomb "Glide bomb")
 and it is unclear if his [bomb damage assessment](/wiki/Bomb_damage_assessment "Bomb damage assessment")
 includes both missiles and artillery ammunition.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, Russia, on September 17-18, 2024. The attack caused explosions and fires at the depot, which stored various munitions, including missiles, artillery ammunition, and potentially North Korean supplies. The depot was renovated in 2018 and was claimed to meet high international standards.

The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions)), CNN ([https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl)), and Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/what-was-stored-at-the-russian-arms-depot-in-tver-region-struck-by-ukraines-drones](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/what-was-stored-at-the-russian-arms-depot-in-tver-region-struck-by-ukraines-drones)) all include images of the depot before and after the attack, showing the damage. <image:23>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is inaccurate. The evidence indicates that the ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack, not a NATO strike. The attack caused significant damage, including explosions and fires, and destroyed a warehouse storing various munitions.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, Russia, on September 17-18, 2024. The attack caused explosions and fires at the depot, which stored various munitions, including missiles, artillery ammunition, and potentially North Korean supplies. The depot was renovated in 2018 and was claimed to meet high international standards.

The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions)), CNN ([https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl)), and Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/what-was-stored-at-the-russian-arms-depot-in-tver-region-struck-by-ukraines-drones](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/what-was-stored-at-the-russian-arms-depot-in-tver-region-struck-by-ukraines-drones)) all include images of the depot before and after the attack, showing the damage. <image:23>


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:23>) shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a Ukrainian drone attack. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/)) reports that the attack triggered a massive explosion and destroyed a warehouse storing missiles, guided bombs, and artillery ammunition. The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e)) confirms the attack, which caused a fire and injured at least 13 people, and that the depot housed missiles, glide bombs, and artillery shells.

The Washington Post ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-blast-drones-missiles-tver/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-blast-drones-missiles-tver/)) also reported on the attack, mentioning a massive fireball. The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces. The destroyed ammunition included North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles.


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The evidence indicates that the ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack, not a NATO strike. The attack caused significant damage, including explosions and fires, and destroyed a warehouse storing various munitions.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. The evidence clearly shows that the ammunition depot was attacked by Ukrainian drones, not NATO. The sources provide detailed information about the attack, including the type of munitions stored and the damage caused. `false`

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

Dmytro: Inches from death
-------------------------

In social media posts on 11-12 March, a fourth soldier, "Dmytro" likened the retreat from the front to "a scene from a horror movie".

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:5984>!Getty Images A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk <image:5985>Getty Images

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.

Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that his forces had advanced up to 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of two more settlements there.

Russia said it had struck Ukraine's 22nd and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, and a Guard and Support Brigade in at least 12 different places with air strikes, artillery and infantry.

Moscow said it had also repelled attacks at seven additional places in Kursk and had struck Ukrainian forces at 16 other locations in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region.

"Units of the northern group of forces, with the support of army aviation and artillery fire, repelled attacks by enemy assault groups in the direction of the settlements of Kremyanoye, Malaya Loknya and Nechayev," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

It said Russian forces had also "thwarted attempts to attack in the direction of Komarovka, Spalnoye, Korenevo, Pogrebky and Olgovka."

The ministry said it was seeking to identify and destroy Ukrainian sabotage units which had hidden in the forests in an attempt to penetrate deeper into Russian sovereign territory.

While the Kursk incursion has grabbed headlines, Russian officials say the attack will fail to draw Russian forces away from the east of Ukraine where they are still advancing.

MOSCOW, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it had struck Ukrainian forces at more than a dozen places along the front in the Kursk region of western Russia where Ukraine has carved out a slice of territory after smashing through the Russian border 20 days ago.

Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers punched through the border on Aug. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports from either side.

Russia also gave estimates for Ukrainian losses in Kursk, but Reuters does not publish combatant estimates from either side.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 tanks destroyed")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:26> appears in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, reports on Russia capturing German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. A third article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

None of the articles mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region. The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/)) discusses the conflict in the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukraine has made incursions.

The BBC article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025 (<image:5987>). The Reuters article mentions that Ukraine has lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers, and 404 armored combat vehicles. The BBC article mentions that the roads were littered with destroyed military equipment (<image:5984>, <image:5989>, <image:5993>). The Reuters article includes an image of a crossing point on the border with Russia in the Sumy region (<image:5994>). The Wikipedia article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces, and provides casualty figures from both sides. The image in the claim is also present in the Wikipedia article (<image:26>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The image in the claim does depict destroyed military equipment, and the web search confirms that there was a conflict in the Kursk region in August 2024, where Ukraine made incursions. The Reuters article states that Ukraine lost tanks and armored vehicles. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the destroyed tanks in the image are Ukrainian.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively confirmed without additional information.
