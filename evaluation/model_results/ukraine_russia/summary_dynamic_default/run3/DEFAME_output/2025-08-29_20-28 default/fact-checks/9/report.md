## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region, including Sudzha. The article includes a picture of a damaged statue of Lenin in Sudzha and a map showing Sudzha under Ukrainian control in August 2024 and under Russian control on March 16, 2025. The article also mentions that President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)).

Meduza published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing Russia's counteroffensive in the Kursk region, mentioning Sudzha and the Kursk Offensive ([https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/17/a-costly-gamble](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/17/a-costly-gamble)). CNN reports that Volodymyr Zelensky said on August 15, 2024, that Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Sudzha ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl)). ![image 5594](media/2025-08-29_20-30-1756499435-292190.jpg), ![image 5588](media/2025-08-29_20-30-1756499431-135844.jpg), <image:k>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 7](media/9.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible. CNN reported that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024. The BBC article and Meduza mention the Kursk Offensive and Sudzha. The image's metadata is missing, so it's impossible to verify the exact date and location. However, the evidence supports the possibility of Zelensky visiting Sudzha in August 2024.

The claim states that Zelensky arrived in August 2024 in Sudzha, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops. The BBC article and CNN report support the claim that Sudzha was under Ukrainian control in August 2024.

The claim also states that Zelensky met with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide information about whether Zelensky met with representatives. Therefore, this part of the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is partially accurate. While there is evidence that Ukrainian forces controlled Sudzha in August 2024, and that Zelensky may have visited, there is no information to verify whether he met with representatives of the people.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially accurate. According to a CNN report, Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, and the BBC and Meduza articles mention the Kursk Offensive and Sudzha, supporting the possibility of Zelensky visiting the area at that time. However, the evidence does not verify whether Zelensky met with representatives of the people, making the claim only partially accurate.
