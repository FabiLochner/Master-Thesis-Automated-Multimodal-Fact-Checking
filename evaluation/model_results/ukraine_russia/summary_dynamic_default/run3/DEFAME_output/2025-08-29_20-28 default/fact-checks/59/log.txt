The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image is an authentic list of US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine is not supported by evidence. While there have been allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and Ukraine, there is no evidence to support these claims, and the image lacks any verifiable source or context. Sources like BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217)) and PBS News ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/former-fbi-informant-to-plead-guilty-to-lying-about-fake-bribery-scheme-involving-the-bidens](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/former-fbi-informant-to-plead-guilty-to-lying-about-fake-bribery-scheme-involving-the-bidens)) report that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden.

So, the overall veracity is: false
