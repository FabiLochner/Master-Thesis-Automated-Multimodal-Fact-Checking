Useful result: From [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner): Found exact image on website with title: AIRLINER Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster
Content: The search result from Merriam-Webster defines "airliner" as an airplane operated by an airline. The image in the claim is found on the website. The last updated date is August 13, 2025.

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there is evidence of Chinese involvement in activities related to Russia, including military drills and the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the image used in the claim is of an airliner and not related to Chinese Red Cross troops. The reverse image search results show the image is associated with the term "airliner" and appears on Wikipedia, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and Merriam-Webster.

So, the overall veracity is: false
