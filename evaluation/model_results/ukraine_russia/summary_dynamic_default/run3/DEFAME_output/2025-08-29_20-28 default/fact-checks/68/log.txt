Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-led-house-poised-to-censure-schiff-over-trump-russia-investigations): 
Content: The PBS article discusses the House of Representatives' censure of Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of Donald Trump, over his comments about investigations into Trump's ties to Russia. The article mentions that Republicans blocked Schiff from sitting on the intelligence panel. The article also mentions that Schiff was the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment trial.

The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Adam Schiff was blocked from the House Intelligence Committee by House Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, there is no evidence that John Thune blocked any of Schiff's committee assignments.

So, the overall veracity is: false
