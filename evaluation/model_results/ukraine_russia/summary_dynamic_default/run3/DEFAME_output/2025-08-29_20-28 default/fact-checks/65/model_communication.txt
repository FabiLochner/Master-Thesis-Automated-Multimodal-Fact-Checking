CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

What Happens Next
-----------------

Although the drills end on Tuesday, Japan's Ministry of Defense warned that China's military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

Meanwhile, Medvedev has not posted on social media since July 31, and Russian media outlets have largely not reacted to his spat with Trump, which could suggest a truce in the online war of words.

's ally.

The Maritime Interaction 2025 exercises with Beijing had been planned before Trump denounced as "foolish and inflammatory" nuclear threats from former Russian President [Dmitry Medvedev](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/dmitry-medvedev)
.

But the drills are the latest sign of deepening military cooperation between the countries as Trump's announcement adds to growing tensions between Moscow and Washington.

Retired U.S. Getty Images

Why It Matters
--------------

Before Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia and China signed a "no limits" strategic partnership, and since then, their military and economic ties have increased, although Beijing has claimed neutrality in the war.

China and Russia have carried out annual drills for years, but the latest ones come at a sensitive time in which Trump has expressed his growing anger with Putin and responded to Medvedev's nuclear saber rattling.

What To Know
------------

The navies of Russia and China are conducting joint artillery and anti-submarine drills in the Sea of Japan, near the Russian port of Vladivostok, as part of the "Maritime Interaction-2025" exercise, Russian officials said on Sunday.

Russian and Chinese media said the drills involved the joint detachment of Russian and Chinese warships, including a large Russian anti-submarine vessel and two Chinese destroyers.

Also taking part were diesel-electric submarines from both countries and a Chinese submarine rescue ship.

Four Chinese vessels, including guided-missile destroyers _Shaoxing_ and _Urumqi_, were taking part, according to China's Defense Ministry.

The drills, which are scheduled to end on Tuesday, include artillery fire exercises, anti-submarine warfare training, air defense operations, and joint search and rescue missions.

Partnership Short of Alliance: Military Cooperation Between Russia and China
============================================================================

The growing military-technical partnership between Russia and China has become an influential factor in shaping global security dynamics.

**Executive Summary:**
----------------------

*   Before 2014**,** military cooperation between Russia and China was characterized by pragmatic, practical considerations: Russia contributed to the modernization of China’s armed forces by selling various types of weaponry, while Beijing was a lucrative market for Russia’s military-industrial complex.
*   Since the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia has lost access both to  Ukraine’s defense industry and to its Western military-industrial partners. Limited trust is also reflected in the joint Russian-Sino military exercises, as these maneuvers are more about demonstrating the will of cooperation to the outside world than improving interoperability between Russian and Chinese armed forces.
*   Due to these limitations, while military cooperation along shared interests will continue, it is extremely unlikely that it will develop into any functioning, institutionalized alliance.

The growing military-technical partnership between Russia and China has become an increasingly influential factor in shaping global security dynamics, particularly in the context of Russia’s ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine. Nevertheless, we can draw some conclusions about the general trends of military cooperation between the two countries, especially given the absence of certain actions and commitments, which are indicative of the limits of their military cooperation.

The Beginning: A Pragmatic, Practical Partnership
-------------------------------------------------

The military cooperation of post-Soviet Russia and China began as a relatively straightforward arms trade relationship in the 1990s and has evolved into a complex partnership. https://eng.globalaffairs.ru/articles/russian-in-place-of-foreign/")
 All in all, before 2014, Russia was an important provider of military hardware for China, dominantly based on commercial motivations.

Deepening Cooperation in the Context of the Post-2014 Sanctions
---------------------------------------------------------------

The international sanctions gradually introduced against Russia following the 2014 occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea started to change the overall dynamics of Russian-Sino military cooperation and the motives behind it. This affected both the political and military-technological dimensions of their cooperation, motivated by Russia’s sudden loss of access to Ukrainian defense industrial products, such as ship engines and missile technology, as well as Western sanctions against the Russian defense industry.     

Hence, from 2014 to 2022, military cooperation between Russia and China witnessed significant developments, marked by a rapid expansion in several key areas, as China became Russia’s only remaining alternative for technology imports. https://chinapower.csis.org/china-russia-military-cooperation-arms-sales-exercises/")
 While China has made strides in developing its domestic defense industry, it continues to acquire advanced Russian military hardware, including missile systems and cutting-edge aircraft. https://armstransfers.sipri.org/ArmsTransfer/CSVResult")

In 2014, a new dimension of bilateral military cooperation emerged: Russia importing technology from China. https://chinapower.csis.org/china-russia-military-cooperation-arms-sales-exercises/")

In parallel, joint military exercises and operations saw a significant uptick. As climate change reshapes the Arctic landscape, opening new maritime routes and resource frontiers, the region is poised to become an arena where geopolitics, security, and great-power competition converge.

For China, strengthening military and logistical cooperation with Russia in the Arctic is more than a pragmatic choice — it is a declaration of its rising influence on the world stage.

The Chinese soldiers captured by Ukraine in April 2025 were not part of any organized Chinese contingent sent to fight alongside Russia, similar to the units deployed by North Korea."

The Joint Sea-2025 exercises began in waters near the Russian port of Vladivostok and will last for three days, China’s Ministry of National Defence said in a statement on Sunday.

The two sides will hold “submarine rescue, joint anti-submarine, air defence and anti-missile operations, and maritime combat”.

Four Chinese vessels, including guided-missile destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, are participating in the exercises, alongside Russian ships, the ministry said.

After the drills, the two countries will conduct naval patrols in “relevant waters of the Pacific”.

China and Russia have carried out annual drills for several years, with the “Joint Sea” exercises beginning in 2012.

Last year’s drills were held along China’s southern coast.

With this year’s drills in the Sea of Japan, in its annual report last month, Japan’s Ministry of Defence warned that China’s growing military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

“The exercise is defensive in nature and is not directed against other countries,” the Russian Navy Pacific Fleet said earlier this week, according to a report by the US Naval Institute’s online news and analysis portal.

On Friday, the Chinese Defence Ministry said this year’s exercises were aimed at “further deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership” of the two countries.

China has never denounced Russia’s more than three-year [war](/video/newsfeed/2025/8/3/ukraine-claims-drone-strike-on-oil-refinery-in-russia)
 nor called for it to withdraw its troops, and many of Ukraine’s allies, including the US, believe that Beijing has provided support to Moscow.

European leaders asked China last month to use its influence to pressure Russia to end the war, now in its fourth year, but there was no sign that Beijing would do so.

China, however, insists it is a neutral party, regularly calling for an end to the fighting while also accusing Western countries of prolonging the conflict by arming Ukraine.

Content: "Following the Foreign Ministerial Meeting in March 1996, exchanges for the current fiscal year began in April on an expanding scale agreed by both countries.

(3) President Yeltsin announced during his visit to Japan that Russia would withdraw all military troops other than border troops from the Northern Territories. We believe that the complete withdrawal of Russian military troops would be an important contribution to creating an appropriate environment for the resolution of the territorial issue.

(4) Japan also attaches importance to security dialogue and exchange with Russia as a confidence-building measure, which include Japan-Russia policy planning talks, defense scholars exchange, Agreement on the prevention of incidents at sea beyond territorial waters and the air space above them, Visit to Russia by Director-General, Bureau of Defense Policy of Japan's Defense Agency in November 1994 and Trilateral Forum on North Pacific Security by Japan, Russia, and the United States (Its first round of meetings were held in 1994 and 1995).

Foreign Minister Ikeda and Foreign Minister Primakov agreed upon Ministerial level exchanges between Japan's Defense Agency and Russia's Defense Ministry. Japan also received 4 Russian children to a Japanese hospital who were seriously injured by the earthquake for rehabilitation treatment.

### Safety in the nuclear power industry

Bilateral assistance under the Russia-Japan Joint Program helps to enhance safety in the Russian nuclear power industry, mainly through international seminars on nuclear safety, training and instruction, and joint technical projects (the applicability test on a leak detection system for RBMK, and technical cooperation for a nuclear power plant training center).

Japan also contributes to multilateral assistance projects. [About Us](/about/index.html)

Japan's Policy on the Russian Federation
========================================

1\. Basic Objectives
--------------------

The basic objectives of Japan's policy on Russia are to make the utmost efforts to resolve the Northern Territories issue, thereby concluding a peace treaty and fully normalizing relations with Russia, and to provide appropriate assistance for the reform efforts of Russia in coordination with the international community.

A new basis for the future development of relations between Japan and Russia was established by the visit to Japan by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1993 when the Tokyo Declaration was signed. Japan has been working since then to enhance relations with Russia, both political and economic, through a series of political dialogues. These include the March 1994 visit to Russia by then-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Tsutomu Hata, a visit to Japan in late November 1994 by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg N. Soskovets and a visit to Japan in early March 1995 by then-Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei V. Most recently, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs Yukihiko Ikeda visited Russia last March to meet President Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Primakov and First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets. 
In these talks, Japan and Russia have repeatedly reaffirmed their stance to advance bilateral relations based on the Tokyo Declaration, as well as the commitment of the Russian Government to the reform process, and the intention of Japan to continue assistance as long as Russia's reform process continues.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Arthur Novosiltsev / Moskva News Agency

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia, with surging government spending on the war continuing to provide a powerful economic stimulus for the country.

The IMF also slashed its outlook for Ukraine, whose economy and infrastructure have been battered by two and a half years of conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine are spending huge sums to continue fighting in the war, with Moscow's state expenditures having helped the economy grow strongly despite a barrage of Western sanctions.

According to its latest forecast, the IMF said it expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 3.2%. But it also cut its prediction for next year's growth from 1.5% to 1.3% amid signs of mounting economic problems.

Russia's Central Bank has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the government's military spending, saying the economy has been “overheating” for months. High inflation — 8.6% in September — and intense labor shortages are also posing economic headaches for Moscow.

In a rare move, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged earlier this month that Russia's record low unemployment of 2.4% was a “limiting factor” for the country's growth prospects.

Russia's Central Bank has raised interest rates to 19% in a bid to bring inflation under control, and it could increase them again at a meeting this coming Friday.

Russia's Finance Ministry, meanwhile, proposed raising military spending next year by almost 30% to around $145 billion, with combined defense and security spending set to account for approximately 40% of state expenditures.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, information about the IMF's ranking of the Russian economy in October 2024 is missing.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, information about the IMF's ranking of the Russian economy in October 2024 is missing.

## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (<image:4533>). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (<image:4535>). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, information about the IMF's ranking of the Russian economy in October 2024 is missing.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

----------- Zhou said that “it is impossible for Beijing to stand by idly” in the face of deteriorating relations between Russia and the US, but that there was space to strengthen the policies governing the control of nuclear weapons stockpiles.

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

[We use cookies in a limited and restricted manner for specific purposes. Only a limited number of hard copies have been distributed to select national security officials and Pentagon leaders, the newspaper reported.

The newspaper added, however, that in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change prior to a more comprehensive and unclassified update to Congress that is anticipated before Biden's term concludes.

The Pentagon believes that China’s nuclear arsenal will rival the size and diversity of US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade, the Times reported.

“The president recently released updated guidance for nuclear weapons employment to address the presence of multiple nuclear-armed adversaries,” the newspaper cited Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who previously worked at the Pentagon, as saying earlier this month before returning to academia.

He further noted that this guidance specifically considers “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal, it added.

In June, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, said Biden "recently issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance, which takes into account the realities of a new nuclear era."

"It emphasizes the need to account for the growth and diversity of the PRC’s nuclear arsenal—and the need to deter Russia, the PRC and North Korea simultaneously," he added, referring to the People’s Republic of China, China’s official name.

White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told Anadolu that the US nuclear policy is updated regularly as part of their efforts to "reduce nuclear risks and maintain stable deterrence.”

"This administration—like the four administrations before it—issued a Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Employment Planning Guidance."

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

Main article: [Battle of Warsaw (1920)](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")

In the event known by the critics as the "Miracle of the Vistula," the [Polish Army](/wiki/Polish_Army "Polish Army")
 under the command of Marshal [Józef Piłsudski](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski "Józef Piłsudski")
 successfully repulsed a [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
 offensive outside of Warsaw in mid-August 1920. As the day coincides with the religious [Day of the Assumption](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, church masses across the country reflect on the memory of Poland's military dead.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, a number of military-themed events are held throughout many of the nation's larger towns and cities, including equipment demonstrations for the general public and open house events.[\[10\]](#cite_note-TVNWarszawa-10)

In Warsaw, the holiday is commemorated by several state events in the central [Śródmieście](/wiki/%C5%9Ar%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie,_Warsaw "Śródmieście, Warsaw")
 borough of the capital."

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.
