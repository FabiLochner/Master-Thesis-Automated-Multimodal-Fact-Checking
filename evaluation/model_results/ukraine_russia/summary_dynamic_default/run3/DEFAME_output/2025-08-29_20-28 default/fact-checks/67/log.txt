The claim 'Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires from January 2025.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including a Tasnim News Agency article ([Source](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)), indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. However, the article does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance. Furthermore, articles from the German Marshall Fund of the United States ([Source](https://www.gmfus.org/news/inflaming-divides-russian-narratives-california-wildfires)) and NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) discuss how Russian state-affiliated accounts used the wildfires to spread false narratives, but they do not mention any offers of assistance. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
