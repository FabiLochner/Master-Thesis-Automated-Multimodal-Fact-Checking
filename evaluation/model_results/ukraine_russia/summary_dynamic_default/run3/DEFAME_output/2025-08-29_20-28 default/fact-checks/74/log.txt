The article is written by David L. Stern, Natalia Abbakumova, and Robyn Dixon. <image:23> is not mentioned in the article.

The claim '<image:23> This image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after it was hit by a, possible nuclear, strike from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a Ukrainian drone attack, not a NATO strike as the claim suggests. Multiple sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions)), CNN ([https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/)), confirm the Ukrainian attack, which resulted in explosions, fires, and the destruction of stored ammunition.

So, the overall veracity is: false
