Justification: Multiple news sources, including Newsweek, The Hindustan Times, and The Economic Times, reported on an incident involving a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet, with reports of a fire and explosion. However, these reports also state that there were no reported injuries, and the cause of the incident is unknown. Therefore, the claim that Putin died in an explosion is not supported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
