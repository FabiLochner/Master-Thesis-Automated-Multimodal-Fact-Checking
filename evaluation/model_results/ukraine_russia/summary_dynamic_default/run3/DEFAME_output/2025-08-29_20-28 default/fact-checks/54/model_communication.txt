The Trump administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine, providing a potentially powerful tool to Kyiv as it continues to face a [relentless assault by Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-attack-hnk-intl)
.

The announcement of the proposed $825 million sale Thursday comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have yet to yield a result and following a deadly night of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital.

It was announced after President Donald Trump met this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin and separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Although the Trump administration has approved a number of sales of equipment to sustain existing weapons, this appears to be the first major arms sale of new weapons to Ukraine announced by the administration.

A source familiar said that if the sale is concluded as expected, the missiles – which have a range of 150-280 miles – could be delivered later this year.

It is unclear whether there will be restrictions on their use.

“Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase,” the notice from the State Department said. “The ERAM is an example of working together with our NATO allies to develop a capable and scalable system capable of being delivered on a fast timeline.”

“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,” it said.

US State Department (2025), “[U.S. 2025), my co-authors and I assess the economic value of the military aid provided by the US to Ukraine. Poland) under the ‘Ukraine aid’ umbrella, to identify specifically grants made by the US to Ukraine.

We also examine direct budget support (non-military aid) from the US to Ukraine, stripping out repayable loans, including specifically grants made by the US to Ukraine, and accounting for US funds that were used to collateralise loans. We also note the extensive terms and conditionality of this aid, which meant that the aid was among the most transparent and audited expenditures, and the Government of Ukraine was never in a position to misappropriate any of the funds.

Our analysis concludes that in three years of full-scale war, **the total monetary value of US aid delivered to Ukraine’s government amounts to $50.9 billion**, **of which $18.3 billion comprises military aid**, with the remaining $32.6 billion direct budget support in the form of expense reimbursement through the World Bank and collateral for loans. These figures differ from the appropriation amounts by a factor of two to three (see Figure 1)

![Figure 1 Breakdown of different categories of US aid provided to Ukraine into military (in blue) and direct budget support (in green), with verified values shaded in dark colouring and excess reported amounts in light colouring](/sites/default/files/styles/popup_small/public/2025-03/full_aid_breakdown.png?itok=x9uGOBrS)

We break down US support into eight categories: (1) direct funding via international institutional accounts (e.g. World Bank); (2) loans; (3) collateral for the issuance of loans to the Government of Ukraine; (4) Treasury Account Grants for US defence procurement; (5) direct equipment transfer under Presidential  Drawdown Authority; (6) indirect equipment transfer by purchasing replacement equipment for an ally; (7) so-called ‘lend-lease’ agreements (enacted but never used); and (8) Foreign Military Financing (FMF) accounts, which allowed strategic loans to Ukraine to purchase US defence supplies.

**Direct funding** (1) consists of the $31 billion that the US provided through World Bank accounts managed by USAID contractors Deloitte and KPMG. Poland is a NATO member, so investment in its defence sector is not aid for Ukraine. 

The **lend-lease** (7) programme expired unused.

**Foreign military assistance loans** (8) comprise approximately $9.2 billion in loans allocated by the US for Ukraine and 17 other countries affected by the Russian war to procure American-made military supplies, services, and equipment.

Summing these together, we estimate that the true value of military aid provided by the US to Ukraine totals $18.3 billion, and the direct budgetary support totals $32.6 billion (in the form of reimbursement of expenses or collateral for loans), although this portion also includes overheads by intermediaries, and the true value is likely lower.

The total comes out to $50.9 billion, or less than $17 billion per year. For comparison, it is roughly the cost of maintenance and energy for federal buildings.

In addition, we note that Ukraine has been subject to extensive audits as an aid recipient (US Congress 2023), and there has been no evidence of issues or anomalies unearthed through those mechanisms. Furthermore, budgetary support from the US to Ukraine has often come with conditionality such as Ukraine implementing specific reforms (Yellen 2024).

Overall, despite the US being the largest country-to-country provider of aid to Ukraine, the value provided is significantly smaller than frequently cited numbers, and small in relative terms compared to the US economy. Department of Treasury, 30 December.

WASHINGTON (TND) — The Biden Administration is [still planning on sending $5.9 billion](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/24/white-house-ukraine-military-aid-00180780 "https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/24/white-house-ukraine-military-aid-00180780")
 worth of weapons and equipment to Ukraine but has some obstacles to overcome before the funding expires at the end of the month.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. has given Ukraine more than [$107 billion in military assistance](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congressionally-approved-ukraine-aid-totals-175-billion "https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congressionally-approved-ukraine-aid-totals-175-billion")
 since Russia invaded in 2022.

But where is all the money going?[](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1 "https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1")
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[According to the Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1 "https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine#chapter-title-0-1")
:  

> The historic sums are helping a broad set of Ukrainian people and institutions, including refugees, law enforcement, and independent radio broadcasters, though most of the aid has been military-related.

The money and weapons are always accounted for though. Back in January, a [report from the Office of the Inspector General](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/11/2003374323/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2024-043-EEMU_REDACTED%20SECURE.PDF "https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/11/2003374323/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2024-043-EEMU_REDACTED%20SECURE.PDF")

 that got sent to Ukraine wasn’t properly tracked and could’ve been stolen, smuggled, or potentially gone to Ukraine’s military but wasn’t properly recorded

Despite all the money and military equipment the U.S. is sending to Ukraine the war is still not over.

[On one front in the north](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/g-s1-17561/ukraine-russia-war-three-fronts "https://www.npr.org/2024/08/19/g-s1-17561/ukraine-russia-war-three-fronts")
, Ukrainian troops carried out a surprise invasion into Russian territory and have maintained that ground since early August. But on another in the East, Russian forces are making steady advances and are closing in on a town with the majority of Ukraine’s military supply lines. 

But [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has a victory](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-victory-sets-a-deadline-for-partners-speedy-and-strategic-steps-needed-from-today-and-until-december/ "https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-victory-sets-a-deadline-for-partners-speedy-and-strategic-steps-needed-from-today-and-until-december/")

Ukraine isn’t the only recipient of massive amounts of foreign aid from the U.S."

. 

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the US government has been caught between three competing demands: surging defense articles and services to Ukraine, ensuring accountability for US arms shipments, and managing escalation risks. arms transfers, informing procedures and policies for future transfers.

##### US Security Assistance to Ukraine

Since 2015, the United States government [has](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/6707)
 trained and equipped the Ukrainian military through Operation Atlantic Resolve. Drawdowns and supplemental bills have become the main methods to appropriate funds for Ukrainian assistance, including humanitarian aid. 

Initially, the US supplied light weapons and small arms, like [Javelin anti-tank missiles](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-plane-brings-military-equipment-munitions-ukraine-2022-01-25/)
, and has since expanded to include artillery, tanks, and long-range ordinance [like](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-quietly-shipped-long-range-atacms-missiles-ukraine-2024-04-24/)
 the Army Tactical Missile. In September 2002, the State Department announced that two years prior, Ukraine’s president Leonid Kuchma [illegally](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002-10/news/us-says-ukrainian-president-approved-arms-sale-iraq)
 sold missiles to Iraq, and in light of this, the US put a hold on a portion of its aid to the country. In August, the Government Accountability Office [found](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/08/us-still-needs-improve-monitoring-arms-sent-ukraine-gao-finds/398950/)
 that the State Department and the Pentagon have not always communicated on how to properly ensure that end-use monitoring is being implemented. This figure leaves out the [non-military](https://www.gao.gov/blog/ukraine-aid-important-so-oversight-funding-and-assistance)
 aid to Ukraine from the US, and it excludes the [tens of billions of aid](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 provided to the country since Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. While the sheer amount of aid has caused [political](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/08/23/ukraine-kursk-offensive-russia-weapons/)

 in Washington, it has been a relatively successful program so far. <image:5982>

If the US government succeeds in helping Ukraine defend its territory without the arms being diverted to forces outside Ukraine, or used by Ukrainian forces in acts in violation of international humanitarian law, it could emerge as a useful precedent for promoting transparency in U.S. With [an incursion](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-incursion-into-kursk-consistent-with-us-policy/)
 into Russia’s European territory, Ukraine has expanded the battlefield to include both legally Ukrainian and Russian soil.

[Since](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898)
 the Trump Administration, the United States government has been more transparent about security assistance to Ukraine than arms shipments to other countries. Scandals like this, in addition to Ukraine’s political instability, meant the US government was reluctant to provide military aid to the country."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While there are reports of the US providing substantial military aid to Ukraine, and some equipment not being properly tracked, there is no mention of Ukraine selling any of the received armaments. One source mentions a sale of missiles to Ukraine, but this was approved by the Trump administration and funded by other countries, not a sale by Ukraine.
