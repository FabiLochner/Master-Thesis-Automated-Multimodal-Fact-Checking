## Elaboration
The claim that Ben Stiller received $4 million from USAID for his meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky is false. Evidence indicates that Stiller met with Zelensky on June 20, 2022, as part of his role as a goodwill ambassador for the UNHCR. However, Stiller denied receiving any USAID funding for his trip, stating that he self-funded it.


## Final Judgement
The claim is false because the evidence indicates that Ben Stiller did not receive $4 million from USAID for his meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky. Stiller himself refuted these claims, stating that he self-funded his humanitarian trip.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Ben Stiller did meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 20, 2022, as part of his role as a goodwill ambassador for the UNHCR, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he received $4 million from USAID. In fact, Stiller denied receiving any such funding, stating that he self-funded his trip, as reported by sources like [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOoqmZtyUwoMPiFsX8zL7DdXJOT30rVSXIZLNyC8z9NQ6jnf-Uufb).
