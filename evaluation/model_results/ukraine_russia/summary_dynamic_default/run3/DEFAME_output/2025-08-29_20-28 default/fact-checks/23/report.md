## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan provided to the Ukrainian government in late 2024 and that President Trump froze military aid in early March 2025, lifting the freeze shortly after. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) mentions that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg).

The CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine, including weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg). The article also mentions that the Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. provided military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the claim that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The NPR article states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The CSIS article mentions weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program in February 2025.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the U.S. has provided military aid to Ukraine, but the amount stated in the claim ($350 billion) is not supported by the provided sources. The evidence indicates a much lower figure, around $75 billion since 2022.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has provided military aid, sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war) indicate that the total military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022 is around $75 billion. Additionally, a [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) article from February 2025 discusses specific weapons sales, but not the amount stated in the claim.
