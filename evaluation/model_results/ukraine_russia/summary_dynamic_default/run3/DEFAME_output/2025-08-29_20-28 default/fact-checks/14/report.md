### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/) debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The article states that the article was not published by Fox News. The DW article ([dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118)) fact-checks a claim that Fox News reported USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center and states that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The Wikipedia article ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine))) discusses the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center, a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. ![image 11](media/14.jpg) ![image 1806](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593661-766175.jpg) ![image 1807](media/2025-08-07_19-07-1754593662-830512.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is not entirely accurate.

The article's content, which alleges that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID, is circulating as disinformation.
