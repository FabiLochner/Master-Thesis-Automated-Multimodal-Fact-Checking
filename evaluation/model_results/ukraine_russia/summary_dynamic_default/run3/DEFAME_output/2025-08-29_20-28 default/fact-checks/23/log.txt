Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine): 
Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid. The article mentions that in early March 2025, President Donald Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine, lifting the freeze shortly after. The article also mentions a $20 billion loan provided to the Ukrainian government in late 2024. The article does not mention the exact amount of military aid provided by the United States to Ukraine as of February 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine): 
Content: The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine. The article mentions the administration's announcement of weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years. <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>.

The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has provided military aid, sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war) indicate that the total military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022 is around $75 billion. Additionally, a [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) article from February 2025 discusses specific weapons sales, but not the amount stated in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
