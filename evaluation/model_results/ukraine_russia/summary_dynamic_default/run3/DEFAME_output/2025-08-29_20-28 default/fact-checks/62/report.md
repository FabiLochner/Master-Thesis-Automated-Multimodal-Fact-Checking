## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 20](media/62.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

NPR and CNN report that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The U.S. has been launching daily strikes since March 15, 2025. The US launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025. The US has hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025. NPR and CNN report that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The US launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone or that Russian missiles were used.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the timeframe and the involvement of the Houthis and US drones, but the image's content and the use of Russian missiles are not verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone or that Russian missiles were used.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported. While the Houthis did shoot down US drones in March 2025, as reported by the [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission), the evidence does not verify that the image depicts a US drone or that Russian missiles were used.
