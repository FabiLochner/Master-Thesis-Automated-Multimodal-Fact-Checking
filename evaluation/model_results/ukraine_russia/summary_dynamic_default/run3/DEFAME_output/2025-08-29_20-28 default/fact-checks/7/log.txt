Useful result: From [Source](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military): 
Content: Detector Media states that propagandists falsely claim BlackRock owns 47% of Ukraine's territory and asked not to bury soldiers on its land. The press service of the President of Ukraine said that in late 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss projects for the country's recovery. In 2023, the Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund to attract private investment for the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military.

The claim 'BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to the Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)), BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine, and foreign entities are prohibited from purchasing arable land. The claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was spread by Russian and Chinese media.

So, the overall veracity is: false
