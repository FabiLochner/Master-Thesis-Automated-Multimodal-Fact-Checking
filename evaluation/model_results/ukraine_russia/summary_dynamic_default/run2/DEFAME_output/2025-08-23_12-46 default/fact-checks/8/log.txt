Useful result: From [Source](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document_new/file_list/red_cross_movement_activities_overview_ukraine_2022_3.pdf): 
Content: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict. The report mentions the involvement of 58 National Societies, including the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society is at the forefront of the response in Ukraine. <image:k>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of an airliner, not Chinese Red Cross troops. While there is evidence of Chinese involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the Red Cross Society of China and Chinese troops marching in a Moscow parade ([https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)), the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image depicts the troops setting off for the front.

So, the overall veracity is: false
