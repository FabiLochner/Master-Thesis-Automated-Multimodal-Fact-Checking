Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html): 
Content: Voice of America (VOA) reported on January 16, 2025, that Russia exploited the Los Angeles wildfires to push anti-US and anti-Ukraine propaganda. The article mentions Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy regarding the use of inmate firefighters. The article also mentions that Lavrov claimed that the U.S. "burned almost all of California." <image:2557>

The claim 'Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires from January 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025, using the event for propaganda purposes, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. Sources like [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case) and [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html) highlight Russia's involvement in spreading anti-US and anti-Ukraine narratives related to the wildfires, rather than offering aid.

So, the overall veracity is: false
