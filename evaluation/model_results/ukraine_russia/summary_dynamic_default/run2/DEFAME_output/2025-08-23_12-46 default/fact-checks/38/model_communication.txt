His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time.

By [Alex Seitz-Wald](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alex-seitz-wald-ncpn385646)
 and [Katherine Doyle](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/katherine-doyle-ncpn1304357)

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a trip to the U.S., while former President Donald Trump isn’t, highlighting the growing partisan division over a key foreign policy issue.

Harris is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelenskyy at the White House. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Sept. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”

Zelenskyy had implied that he was going to meet with Trump this week, but Trump's campaign said there had been no formal agreement for a meeting.

Trump has been saying for months, and he has repeated more frequently at rallies this week, that he would immediately end the war in Ukraine — even if it was on terms favorable to Moscow — and he dismissed Zelenskyy as a “great salesman” for securing money for his country who “so badly” wants Democrats to win to keep the money flowing.

“Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,” Trump said Tuesday in Georgia."

She took aim at those who've floated Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

September 26, 2024, 6:13 PM

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged to continue support to Ukraine as she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his so-called "victory plan" to bring an end to war with Russia.

Harris cast the conflict as a fight for fundamental principles of "freedom and independence."

"We also know that other would-be aggressors around the world are watching to see what happens in Ukraine," Harris said. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable," she added.

Harris also appeared to take a swipe at her political opponents -- former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. 26, 2024, in the vice president's ceremonial office inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex.

After sources said Wednesday Trump was not expected to meet with Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon Zelenskyy had asked to meet and that they would do so Friday morning at Trump Tower.

"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly," Trump said. We need to stop the death and destruction."

Zelenskyy has called Vance "too radical," taking issue with his [statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/12/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan/)
 that a Trump-Vance administration's approach to the war would likely include Ukraine ceding territory to Russia and the current line of demarcation becoming a demilitarized zone. Johnson told reporters he would not be in town, but if he had sat down with Zelenskyy, would have aired grievances about his tour of an American munitions manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania.

Zelenskyy made the case to lawmakers for permission to strike deeper into Russia at military targets using U.S.-supplied weapons. Several senators on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire for Biden to give Zelenskyy authorization to do so.

Newsweek reports that during an Oval Office meeting, JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race, mentioning a September 2024 visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania (<image:2050>, <image:2051>, <image:2052>). NBC News reports that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. ABC News reports on Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia (<image:1>, <image:2061>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race. This accusation was made during an Oval Office meeting and was linked to Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. NBC News also reported on this visit, with some Republicans viewing it as a signal of Zelenskyy's preference in the election. ABC News reported on a meeting between Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It only mentions that some Republicans viewed his actions as a signal of support.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania or his meetings with Harris were explicitly aimed at supporting Harris's campaign.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania, and some Republicans viewed this as a signal of support for Kamala Harris, there is no direct evidence to confirm that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris or engaging in election interference. The claim is based on an accusation and an interpretation of events, but lacks definitive proof.

 for abuse of power under the theory that he attempted to use a foreign leader—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—to benefit his 2020 presidential campaign, despite a lack of any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of President Trump," Chairman Comer wrote in a press release Wednesday.

A 30-minute phone call between then-president Trump and Zelenskyy in 2019, where the former president asked Zelenskyy to investigate the activities of his then rival President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, was [a part of the impeachment inquiry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/12/i-would-like-you-to-do-us-a-favor-the-30-minute-phone-call-that-changed-trumps-presidency.html)
 into Trump.

"The [Biden-Harris Administration](https://www.cnbc.com/white-house/)
 recently flew the same foreign leader—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—on an American-taxpayer-funded flight to Pennsylvania, a battleground state in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, which has been described as the 'trickiest battleground for Vice President Kamala Harris to win," Comer continued.

Comer sought more information on government resources used for and all internal and external communications regarding the trip in letters sent to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Attorney General Merrick Garland and White House Counsel Edward Siskel.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also sent a sternly worded letter about the Pennsylvania trip Wednesday. James Comer opened an investigation into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Sunday visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania with three Democrats, two of whom are up for reelection in November.
*   Comer claimed that the trip amounted to a campaign event for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, and was done using "taxpayer-funded resources."
*   The relationship between Kyiv and former president Donald Trump chilled further Wednesday, when the Republican Party's standard bearer accused Zelenskyy of "making nasty little dispersions toward me."
*   The investigation comes a day after nine House Republicans signed a letter demanding "a full investigation into the use of U.S. military assets and federal resources in relation to the visit."

"The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant is playing a critical role bolstering Ukraine's forces, and I was honored to join President Zelenskyy to thank Pennsylvania workers for helping defend democracy. Comer claims that the trip was organized to campaign for Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/kamala-harris/)

, and was done using "taxpayer-funded resources."

The Republican investigation comes as the relationship between [Zelenskyy](https://www.cnbc.com/volodymyr-zelenskyy/)
 and former president Donald Trump seems to sour.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of insulting him — Trump said the Ukrainian president was "making nasty little dispersions toward" him — and adding that he got along with Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/)
 "very well."

"There's really nothing for the Ukrainian people to go back to, and it didn't need to happen. JD Vance was "too radical" and his message "seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice," in ending the war with Russia.

When asked if Ukraine should cede land in exchange for a ceasefire with Russia in a press conference Wednesday, Vance said "everything is going to be on the table."

Comer's letter also criticized the timing of the visit with the publishing of Zelenskyy's comments regarding Trump's running mate.

The ammunition factory that Zelenskyy visited is operated by [General Dynamics](/quotes/GD/)
 and manufactures components for 155 mm artillery shells, a crucial piece of ammunition to Ukraine's battle efforts.The United States had shipped more than 3 million rounds of it to Ukraine since February 2022, according to a [Pentagon fact sheet](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jul/03/2003497646/-1/-1/1/UKRAINE-FACT-SHEET-3-JULY.PDF)
 from July 2024

On Wednesday, the Defense Department announced additional security assistance of $375 million for Ukraine, including more of the 155 mm artillery shells that the Scranton factory specializes in manufacturing.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelenskyy wrote on X Sunday.

There, Zelenskyy also met with three Pennsylvania Democrats; Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey and Rep. He also plans to visit the White House on Thursday, where he will meet with President Joe Biden and, later in the day, with Harris.

Trump was expected to meet with the Ukrainian President on Thursday at Trump Tower, but a Trump campaign official told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/harris-trump-presidential-election-live-updates-rcna172163)
 Wednesday that the meeting was not happening. When asked why, a source familiar with the matter pointed to Zelenskyy's New Yorker interview.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that during an Oval Office meeting, JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race, mentioning a September 2024 visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania (<image:2050>, <image:2051>, <image:2052>). NBC News reports that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. ABC News reports on Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia (<image:1>, <image:2061>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race. This accusation was made during an Oval Office meeting and was linked to Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. NBC News also reported on this visit, with some Republicans viewing it as a signal of Zelenskyy's preference in the election. ABC News reported on a meeting between Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It only mentions that some Republicans viewed his actions as a signal of support.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania or his meetings with Harris were explicitly aimed at supporting Harris's campaign.

 to end the war within 24 hours.

During the Oval Office event, Trump and Vance made several misleading claims about Zelenskyy and Ukraine. Thank you so much.”

### Vance: Zelenskyy “went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.”

This is wrong. 27, [Zelenskyy met with Trump in New York](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-new-york-september-27-2024/#3)
.

“It’s an honor to have the president with us, and he’s been through a lot,” Trump said at the time. “He’s been through a tremendous amount, like probably nobody else — almost nobody else in history if you really get right down to it.”

Vance criticized Zelenskyy’s Pennsylvania visit days later at a Newtown, Pennsylvania, [campaign rally](https://youtu.be/IKjCMpaPKos?feature=shared&t=225)
, saying Zelenskyy “came to campaign with the Democratic leadership of this country.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson [also criticized](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania-politics/josh-shapiro-under-partisan-fire-after-ukraines-president-zelenskyy-visits-pennsylvania/)
 Zelenskyy’s Pennsylvania visit, saying “we don’t need foreign countries intervening” in a “hotly contested election.”

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., in September launched an [investigation](https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-probes-biden-harris-administrations-use-of-taxpayer-funded-resources-to-fly-zelensky-to-pennsylvania-to-campaign-for-harris/)

_This fact check originally appeared on [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/feb/28/trump-vance-and-zelenskyys-tense-oval-office-meeti/)

In an extraordinary televised Oval Office meeting, President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shouted and argued about how to end Ukraine’s war with Russia.

Trump threatened to withdraw U.S. In 2022, during President Joe Biden’s tenure, Zelenskyy [started his speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/us/politics/zelensky-speech-transcript.html)
 before a joint meeting of Congress by saying, “Thank you so much. 22, Zelenskyy met with Pennsylvania Gov. It was at a [Scranton ammunition plant,](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 where Zelenskyy thanked workers producing munitions for Ukraine.

The event was an official one for Shapiro, who was not on the ballot in the battleground state in November. Matt Cartwright](https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/shapiro-casey-meet-with-zelenskyy-at-scranton-pennsylvania-ammunitions-factory/)
, Democrats who faced competitive reelection bids, also attended.

On Sept. 26, Zelenskyy met separately with then President Joe [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/26/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-u-s-support-for-ukraine/)

The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race. This accusation was made during an Oval Office meeting and was linked to Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. NBC News also reported on this visit, with some Republicans viewing it as a signal of Zelenskyy's preference in the election. ABC News reported on a meeting between Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It only mentions that some Republicans viewed his actions as a signal of support.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine whether Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania or his meetings with Harris were explicitly aimed at supporting Harris's campaign.

Meeting between US and Ukraine presidents descends into chaos at White House – here’s what they said, word for word

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Vance**: That’s exactly what you’re doing …

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")

The scandal came to light when a [whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower")
 report revealed that President Trump had asked Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 in July 2019 to investigate [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
, Trump's political opponent in the [2020 presidential election](/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election")

[\[11\]](#cite_note-helderman-11)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-press_secretary-24)
 Trump acknowledged he had told Zelenskyy "we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son \[contributing\] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[\[25\]](#cite_note-trump_acknowledges-25)
 According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President [Mike Pence](/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence")
, and Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Balsamo-190926-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-auto2-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)

Immediately after the Trump–Zelenskyy call ended, White House national security aides discussed their deep concerns, with at least one [National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")
 (NSC) official alerting White House national security lawyers.[\[29\]](#cite_note-cnn-oct8-29)
[\[30\]](#cite_note-raised_alarms-30)

 in the [2016 U.S. On May 7, Zelenskyy and a group of his advisors had a three-hour meeting to discuss how to respond to Trump and Giuliani's pressure and how to avoid becoming involved in domestic American politics.[\[90\]](#cite_note-pressure-90)
 Giuliani said the investigations he sought would be beneficial to President Trump, his client, and that his efforts had Trump's full support.[\[91\]](#cite_note-plans_trip-91)
 Giuliani's efforts began as an attempt to provide cover for Trump to pardon Manafort, who had been [convicted of eight felony counts](/wiki/Trials_of_Paul_Manafort "Trials of Paul Manafort")
 in August 2018.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

On May 10, Giuliani canceled a scheduled trip to Ukraine where he had intended to urge president-elect Zelenskyy to pursue inquiries into Hunter Biden, as well as whether Democrats colluded with Ukrainians to release information about Manafort.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)
[\[94\]](#cite_note-WaPo_How_Trump_pressured-94)
 Giuliani claimed he has sworn statements from five Ukrainians stating they were brought into the Obama White House in January 2016 and told to "go dig up dirt on Trump and Manafort", although he has not produced evidence for the claim.[\[95\]](#cite_note-CNBC-eight-times-95)
 Giuliani asserted he cancelled the trip because he had been "set up" by Ukrainians who objected to his efforts, and blamed Democrats for trying to "spin" the trip. On this call, Giuliani said that if Zelenskyy were to publicly announce an investigation into Biden, it would help Zelenskyy have "a much better relationship" with Trump.[\[98\]](#cite_note-new_audio-98)

Responding to a motion by the liberal watchdog group [American Oversight](/wiki/American_Oversight "American Oversight")
,[\[99\]](#cite_note-new_documents-99)
 on October 23 a federal judge gave the State Department 30 days to release Ukraine-related records, including communications between [Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State")
 [Mike Pompeo](/wiki/Mike_Pompeo "Mike Pompeo")
 and Rudy Giuliani.[\[100\]](#cite_note-100)
 On November 22, the State Department released internal emails and documents that bolstered Gordon Sondland's congressional testimony that Pompeo participated in Giuliani's activities relating to Ukraine. Ambassador to Ukraine, was removed from her post because of her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, and because she disagreed with the [shadow diplomacy](/wiki/State_within_a_state "State within a state")
 taking place under Giuliani and President Trump.

[\[98\]](#cite_note-new_audio-98)
 According to Zelenskyy's advisor [Serhiy Leshchenko](/wiki/Serhiy_Leshchenko "Serhiy Leshchenko")
, Trump was willing to have a phone conversation with Zelenskyy only on the precondition that they discuss the possibility of investigating the Biden family. Trump said three times that he would ask both Attorney General Barr and Giuliani to call Zelenskyy,[\[184\]](#cite_note-Timmons-185)
 and added: "So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great."[\[180\]](#cite_note-ShearHaberman-180)

6 fact checks from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting
==============================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Aug 18, 2025 7:10 PM EDT

_This article originally appeared on [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-fact-check-ukraine-russia-deal/)
._

In a more cordial affair than their [last Oval Office meeting](https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/feb/28/trump-vance-and-zelenskyys-tense-oval-office-meeti/)
, President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sat down Aug. 18 at the White House to discuss how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

[**WATCH:** Trump promises ‘lasting peace’ in Zelenskyy meeting, says Ukraine peacekeeping force under consideration](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-trump-promises-lasting-peace-in-zelenskyy-meeting-says-ukraine-peacekeeping-force-under-consideration)

The talks, which included a second meeting with seven European and NATO leaders, took place three days after [Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/aug/14/fact-check-trump-putin-alaska-russia-ukraine-war/)
 in Anchorage, Alaska. 8, after our fact-check’s publication, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan joined Trump in the White House to [sign a joint peace declaration](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/08/us/trump-news)
 after nearly 40 years of conflict.

“One” war left?
---------------

As Trump spoke about how difficult it’s been to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said that, “with all of the wars that I got involved in, we only have this one left.”

But his comment notably ignores Israel’s nearly two-year war with Hamas in Gaza that started on Oct. Trump weighed in on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115049902258471066)
, saying that “we will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!”

$350 billion for Ukraine doesn’t add up.
----------------------------------------

Trump said he thought the U.S. A White House spokesperson told PolitiFact that Trump’s figure included direct funding to Ukraine and indirect economic costs, such as war-related inflation, [rising fertilizer costs](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/price-of-fertilizer/1576/)
 and lost trade because of sanctions on Russia.

Trump’s district dining anecdote.
---------------------------------

In a pivot to Washington, D.C., crime, Trump said the district went from “the most unsafe place anywhere” to a place where people are going out to dinner again. Since meeting with Putin, Trump has talked about reaching a peace deal saying he no longer thinks Ukraine “needs a ceasefire” and noting that there needs to be concessions on both sides.

Here are the meeting’s top lines, fact-checked.

Mail-in ballots are fraud?
--------------------------

For a meeting about a war in Ukraine, mail-in ballots in the U.S. got a surprising spotlight.

Following a [social media post](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/aug/18/donald-trump/mail-voting-elections-Trump-Russia-Ukraine/)
 earlier in the day in which Trump called for getting rid of mail-in voting — a [voting practice he had embraced](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/13/joe-biden/trump-has-spread-falsehoods-about-voting-mail-whil/)
 — Trump called mail-in ballots “corrupt” and “a fraud” and promised to end mail-in voting.

Trump’s remark also comes a day after [hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/world/middleeast/israel-protests-gaza-netanyahu-hostages.html)
 to protest the war. President Trump meets with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and European leaders, in Washington, D.C."

NATO chief calls Trump-Zelenskyy meeting "very successful"
----------------------------------------------------------

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called Monday's meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders "very successful" in an interview with Fox News.

Rutte said that the group discussed security guarantees for Ukraine — which Zelenskyy has cast as a key facet of any potential deal with Moscow. Trump wrote on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115052030103944534)
 that he discussed security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with Zelenskyy and the leaders of several European countries. 

He said the guarantees "would be provided by the various European Countries, with a coordination with the United States of America."

The U.S. Trump said he called Putin shortly after his White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders, aiming to arrange a joint session between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.

"After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself," the president wrote on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115052030103944534)
.

It's unclear if either side has agreed to the proposed meeting.

European leaders tie security guarantees for Ukraine to their own defense
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several of the leaders assembled around the table stressed the importance of guaranteeing Ukraine's security, not just for Kyiv but for the continent as a whole.

"When we talk about security, we're talking about the security not just of Ukraine, we're talking about the security of Europe and the United Kingdom as well," British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said any agreement should focus on "how to be sure that it won't happen again," referring to Russia's invasion.

Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, said the security guarantees are a "big part of this." Finland joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Some of the international media might wonder, why is the president of Finland here? I think the reason is probably that we might come from a small country, but we have a long border with Russia, over 800 miles," Stubb said, mentioning Finland's own history with Russia, including the Soviet invasion of the country during World War II.

"If I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I'm sure we'll be able to find a solution in 2025 to end Russia's war of aggression and find and get a lasting and just peace," Stubb said.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

The session revealed deep divisions within the GOP on U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (R) looks on as U.S. [Mitch McConnell](https://kyivindependent.com/mcconnells-exit-signals-shift-in-republican-support-for-ukraine/)
 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, June 29 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack that involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, authorities said on Sunday, as Moscow intensifies night-time air barrages in the [fourth year of war](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the pilot, Maksym Ustymenko, and bestowed upon him posthumously the title of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest decoration.

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Faerospace-defense%2Fleast-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29%2F)

He also called for more support from Washington and Western allies to bolster Ukraine's air defences after the attack, which damaged homes and infrastructure across the country and injured at least 12 people, according to local authorities.

In Kyiv, families huddled in metro stations for shelter after air raid sirens rung out. Kyiv has not revealed the size of its F-16 fleet, but they have become a central and heavily used part of Ukraine's defences.

The pilot flew the damaged jet away from a settlement but had no time to eject before it crashed, the Ukrainian Air Force said.

"The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude," the Air Force said on Telegram.

Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan, speaking earlier this month, said the F-16 was not ideally suited to all tasks in the war, particularly repelling drones which swarm Ukrainian cities, as it is better used against higher-speed targets.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said Ustymenko had been flying missions since the time of a campaign that began in 2014 against Russian-financed separatists who had seized parts of eastern Ukraine.

"He mastered four types of aircraft and had important results to his name in defending Ukraine," he said. Machine-gun fire and explosions were heard across the capital and in the western city of Lviv, where such attacks are less common.

The governor of the Lviv region, bordering Poland, said the raid targeted critical infrastructure.

Ukraine has now [lost](/world/europe/ukraine-pilot-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-lost-ukrainian-military-says-2025-06-29/)
 three F-16s since it began operating the U.S.-made jets last year. "It is painful to lose such people."

The Ukrainian military said in total Russia launched 477 drones and 60 missiles of various types to Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces destroyed 211 of the drones and 38 missiles, it said, while 225 more drones were either lost due to electronic warfare or were decoys that carried no explosives.

Writing earlier on X, Zelenskiy said: "Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes." He said Russia had launched around 114 missiles, 1,270 drones, and 1,100 glide bombs just in the past week.

Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency said one person was killed by a Ukrainian drone in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's Luhansk region. Both Ukraine and Russia say they do not attack civilian targets.

POLITICAL WILL
--------------

Ukraine says recent attacks highlight the need for further support from Washington, which under President Donald Trump has not committed to new military aid for Ukraine.

Trump said he was considering a Ukrainian request [for more Patriot missile, opens new tab](europe)
 batteries after he met Zelenskiy at a NATO summit last Wednesday.

"This war must be brought to an end - pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection," Zelenskiy said in his X post. "Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence - the thing that best protects lives."

He said Ukraine was ready to buy the American air defence systems and it counts on "leadership, political will, and the support of the United States, Europe, and all our partners."

Russia has launched large-scale strikes on Ukrainian cities every few days in recent weeks, causing widespread damage, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more.

During the latest barrage, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors said. Not really](/legal/legalindustry/did-trump-save-intel-not-really-2025-08-23/)

Ukraine's air force on Sunday confirmed that a third Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot had been killed in action, a unwelcome blow for a military with a limited number of fourth-generation Western jets and a small pool of pilots trained to fly them.

Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Ustimenko intercepted seven incoming Russian air targets in his F-16 jet before his aircraft was damaged and started to lose altitude, Ukraine's air force said in a statement on Sunday.

He is the third known F-16 pilot to be killed while operating the U.S.-made aircraft, which Ukraine has been using for little under a year.

Kyiv had long clamored for donations of the Lockheed Martin-manufactured F-16s to boost its Soviet-era aircraft while staring down Russia's more advanced—and much more numerous—fleet that has taken far fewer hits in the war than Moscow's land forces.

!Ukraine F-16s <image:4866>

Ukrainian Air Force F-16 fighter jets fly over an undisclosed location in Ukraine on August 4, 2024. Losing pilots is also a painful prospect, he told _Newsweek_.

In late August, just weeks after Kyiv confirmed it was operating the first of its donated jets, Ukraine said Oleksiy Mes — a famed pilot also known by his call sign, Moonfish — had died while "repelling a massive Russian combined air and missile attack."

A second F-16 was shot down over the northeastern Sumy region in mid-April this year, killing its 26-year-old pilot, Pavlo Ivanov.

The following month, the air force said it had lost communication with an F-16 intercepting Russian attacks, but that the pilot had managed to eject from the aircraft. Ustimenko "mastered four types of aircraft, and his record includes truly significant achievements for Ukraine," the Ukrainian leader said in his evening address.

Kyiv's military reported in the early hours of Sunday that Russia had launched hundreds of drones and decoys at the country overnight, as well as various different types of missiles. Languages: English, Spanish.You can reach Ellie via email at [e.cook@newsweek.com](mailto:e.cook@newsweek.com)

Newsweek AI is in beta. Ukrainian Air Force F-16 fighter jets fly over an undisclosed location in Ukraine on August 4, 2024. Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's chief of staff, said Moscow had "struck energy facilities, infrastructure, and residential areas."

Ukraine has repeatedly used its F-16 fighter jets, as well French-made Mirage 2000 aircraft Kyiv received in early 2025, to intercept Russian attacks on the country.

"This loss and earlier losses clearly point at the dangers of intercepting low-flying targets at close range with low-flying aircraft," Mertens said, adding the drive to "do the utmost and take serious risks" when in the air can be especially strong when trying to shield civilians and residential buildings.

It's not clear exactly how many of the approximately 85 F-16s committed by Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium are now being used by Ukraine.

Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's defense minister, said in February that Denmark had "already delivered most of the promised F-16s, with the remaining ones to arrive soon." Umerov's Danish counterpart, Troels Lund Poulsen, said shortly after that Copenhagen had transferred 12 out of the 19 jets it had promised Ukraine.

It's not immediately apparent whether the remaining seven jets have been delivered. Standing next to Zelensky during a press conference in April in the Ukrainian capital, the Belgian prime minister said Brussels would send two F-16s for spare parts in 2025 and two more aircraft the following year.

Belgium's current defense minister, Theo Francken, said in May Brussels "would try to deliver the aircraft even earlier," according to remarks reported by the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty outlet. Her work focuses largely on the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. Search and rescue teams quickly located and evacuated the pilot, the military said.

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 said on Sunday he had ordered a full investigation into Ustimenko's death. Ignat told _Newsweek_ it was the highest number of aerial threats recorded since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022.

Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement it had launched a "massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons," including Kinzhal missiles, targeting Ukraine's military industry and the country's oil refineries."

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines. Makeshift signs and barriers warning people not to enter are a common sight on the edges of fields and forests and near roads.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the country “has made a difficult but necessary political decision” to withdraw from the Ottawa convention, saying the government was “convinced” it was necessary to do so.

At the start of this year, the pact had 165 member states – although several major powers, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the United States, have never signed up to it.

Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – which all border Russia – have also made moves to pull out of the treaty arguing they were essential for defense.

CNN’s Sophie Tanno contributed reporting.

## Elaboration
The image in the claim depicts an F-16 that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019 due to hydraulic failure, not a Russian attack. The image has been altered with meme characters. The claim is therefore false.

The web search results confirm that Ukraine has lost F-16s in the conflict with Russia. However, the image in the claim does not depict a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim shows an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Russian attack. The image has been altered with meme characters. The claim is therefore false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim depicts an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, as reported by The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), not a Russian attack. While Ukraine has lost F-16s in the conflict with Russia, the image is unrelated to the current conflict.

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)
 soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, German tanks with German crews were captured, a NATO biolab was found under Mariupol, all with no evidence," Cusumano told _Newsweek_.

Even if proven true, he added that the "the scale and impact of US contractors' involvement is most likely minimal," and that the presence of "a private firm serving private objectives" would not constitute America's direct involvement in Kursk.

Keir Giles, senior research fellow at Chatham House's Russia & Eurasia Program, was less skeptical of the Foreign Ministry's claim, given that "large numbers of foreign volunteers are fighting alongside and supporting Ukrainian forces, Americans among them."

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the incursion beginning on the night of August 5-6, 2024. Newsweek reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia claimed to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in the incursion, and the U.S. denied involvement. The claim aligns with these reports.

The image in the claim shows individuals with what appears to be US flags on their uniforms. This visual evidence supports the claim that American mercenaries were involved. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the exact date and location of the photo.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the identity of the individuals depicted.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claims to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast, and the U.S. has denied involvement. The article was published on August 20, 2024. ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273))

The Anadolu Agency published an article on August 20, 2024, stating that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. The incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755))

The search result from Ukrainian Photographers contains news stories from January 2025. ([https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region))

<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>, <image:0>, <image:i>, <image:j>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the incursion beginning on the night of August 5-6, 2024. Newsweek reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia claimed to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in the incursion, and the U.S. denied involvement. The claim aligns with these reports.

The image in the claim shows individuals with what appears to be US flags on their uniforms. This visual evidence supports the claim that American mercenaries were involved. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the exact date and location of the photo.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the identity of the individuals depicted.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claims to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast, and the U.S. has denied involvement. The article was published on August 20, 2024. ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273))

The Anadolu Agency published an article on August 20, 2024, stating that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. The incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755))

The search result from Ukrainian Photographers contains news stories from January 2025. ([https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region))

<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>, <image:0>, <image:i>, <image:j>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the incursion beginning on the night of August 5-6, 2024. Newsweek reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia claimed to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in the incursion, and the U.S. denied involvement. The claim aligns with these reports.

The image in the claim shows individuals with what appears to be US flags on their uniforms. This visual evidence supports the claim that American mercenaries were involved. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the exact date and location of the photo.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the identity of the individuals depicted.

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана.

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

![Зеленым цветом обозначены освобожденные территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20703'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The reverse image search reveals that the image in the claim is from September 2022 and depicts Ukrainian soldiers, not American mercenaries, in the Balakleya region. The image's context is unrelated to the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as stated in the claim.

The claim is therefore demonstrably false. The image has been taken out of context and used to support a different narrative.

Newsweek reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia claimed to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in the incursion, and the U.S. denied involvement. The claim aligns with these reports.

The image in the claim shows individuals with what appears to be US flags on their uniforms. This visual evidence supports the claim that American mercenaries were involved. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the exact date and location of the photo.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the identity of the individuals depicted.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim appears in articles from Apostrophe.ua ([https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880)), charter97.org ([https://charter97.org/ru/news/2022/9/9/514837/](https://charter97.org/ru/news/2022/9/9/514837/)), and cripo.com.ua ([https://cripo.com.ua/vojna-s-rf/rossyjskye-vojska-begut-pod-natyskom-vsu-mnenye-ekspertov-y-rossyjskyh-voennyh/](https://cripo.com.ua/vojna-s-rf/rossyjskye-vojska-begut-pod-natyskom-vsu-mnenye-ekspertov-y-rossyjskyh-voennyh/)). These articles, published in September 2022, discuss the Ukrainian army's victory in Balakleya and the Russian retreat. The image (<image:24>) shows Ukrainian soldiers with a dead Russian soldier. The cripo.com.ua article also contains an image of a sign that says "Kursk".


## Elaboration
The reverse image search reveals that the image in the claim is from September 2022 and depicts Ukrainian soldiers, not American mercenaries, in the Balakleya region. The image's context is unrelated to the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as stated in the claim.

The claim is therefore demonstrably false. The image has been taken out of context and used to support a different narrative.

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

 under the command of Marshal [Józef Piłsudski](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski "Józef Piłsudski")
 successfully repulsed a [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
 offensive outside of Warsaw in mid-August 1920. As the day coincides with the religious [Day of the Assumption](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, church masses across the country reflect on the memory of Poland's military dead.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, a number of military-themed events are held throughout many of the nation's larger towns and cities, including equipment demonstrations for the general public and open house events.[\[10\]](#cite_note-TVNWarszawa-10)

In Warsaw, the holiday is commemorated by several state events in the central [Śródmieście](/wiki/%C5%9Ar%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie,_Warsaw "Śródmieście, Warsaw")
 borough of the capital."

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

 ![Image:](//static.prsa.pl/images/0cef8818-5db9-4622-ab61-65537c098870.jpg)Image: Polish Ministry of Defence/gov.pl

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a military parade in Poland. The parade was part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations on August 15, 2024, and included a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17. The event showcased military hardware and was an expression of strength in the face of threats.

The claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence. While the event was held in the context of "threats from the East," the evidence does not explicitly state that the parade was a preparation for war.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, as the parade did occur on August 14, 2024. However, the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence.
