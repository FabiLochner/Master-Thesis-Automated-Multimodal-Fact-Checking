The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were reports of F-16s being involved in combat in Ukraine in August 2024, the specific scenario described in the claim, involving a US F-16 shot down over the Black Sea, is not supported by the evidence. The image appears to depict a MiG-29, not an F-16.

So, the overall veracity is: false
