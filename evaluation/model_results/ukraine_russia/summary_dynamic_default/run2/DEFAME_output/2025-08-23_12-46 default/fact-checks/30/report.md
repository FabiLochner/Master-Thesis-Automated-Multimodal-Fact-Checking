## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several articles discuss the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia in 2025. One article from Reuters, published on August 22, 2025, mentions President Trump threatening sanctions on Russia and a meeting between Trump and Putin to discuss a potential meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy (<image:i>). Another article from the BBC discusses the EU's warning against pushing Ukraine to concede territories and mentions Trump's emphasis on "swapping of territories". An Al Jazeera article from August 21, 2025, reports Russia's claim that Ukraine is not interested in a long-term peace deal (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that no peace deal was reached between Ukraine and Russia in early 2025. Multiple articles from August 2025 discuss ongoing conflict, potential negotiations, and disagreements between the involved parties. One article mentions President Trump threatening sanctions, and another reports Russia's claim that Ukraine is not interested in a long-term peace deal.

The provided evidence indicates that the war was still ongoing in August 2025, with no peace deal in place.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the war between Ukraine and Russia was ongoing in August 2025, with no peace deal reached. The articles discuss ongoing conflict and potential negotiations, but not a concluded peace agreement.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence from multiple news sources, including Reuters, BBC, and Al Jazeera, indicates that the war between Ukraine and Russia was ongoing in August 2025, with no peace deal reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing conflict, potential negotiations, and disagreements between the involved parties, contradicting the claim.
