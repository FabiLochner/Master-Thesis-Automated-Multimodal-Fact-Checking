On February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)) ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg). Trump stated that they agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)) also reported that Trump spoke with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and ordered U.S. officials to start talks ![image 4759](media/2025-08-23_12-56-1755953790-197556.jpg).

The Wikipedia article "February 2025 Putinâ€“Trump phone call" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call)) discusses the phone conversation and mentions that Trump shared details and agreed to begin peace talks.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. According to Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)), Trump stated that they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and ordered U.S. officials to start talks. The Wikipedia article also supports this.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that an agreement to end the war was reached, only that discussions and the beginning of negotiations were agreed upon.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Trump and Putin spoke on February 12, 2025, and discussed ending the war in Ukraine, agreeing to begin negotiations. However, the evidence does not support the claim that an agreement to end the war was reached.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
On February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). While they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and agreed to begin negotiations, there is no evidence to support the claim that an agreement to end the war was reached.
