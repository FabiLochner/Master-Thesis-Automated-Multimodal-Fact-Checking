, albeit slowly and at high human and material costs.

Yet, much is unknown about the new policy, and the details will affect the speed of weapons delivery, the effectiveness of the deliveries, and the policy’s political acceptability. stockpiles and competing military needs—remain.

These Critical Questions lay out the status of the program and its future in six graphs and a table.

**Q1: What was the state of military aid to Ukraine when the Trump administration took office?**

**A1:** Before leaving office, the Biden administration had made announcements covering all the available funding for military aid. inventories; Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI, $33 billion) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS, $1 billion), whereby the United States provides funds to Ukraine, and Ukraine contracts with U.S. This occurred because of the delay between announcing an aid package and its delivery to Ukraine; that delay varies according to the delivery mechanism.

PDA weapons arrive quickly, generally within six months of the announcement. <image:4789>](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-07/250715_Cancian_Ukraine_Fig3_0.jpg?VersionId=V1AxH80qeBcycy.x1d9Io9mEK3DFxYvv)

**Q3: What has been the history of aid flow under the Trump administration?**

**A3:** The table below lays out the Trump administration’s actions since taking office in January.

Remote Visualization

**Q4: What aid did the DOD pause on July 1, and why?**

**A4:** Although the specific items paused were not released publicly, they apparently included a Patriot, other air defense systems, and ammunition. Colby has [long](https://hopkinspofa.com/2023/02/13/is-ukraine-a-distraction/)
 [argued](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ukraine-is-a-distraction-from-taiwan-russia-china-nato-global-powers-military-invasion-jinping-biden-putin-europe-11644781247)
 that the Russia-Ukraine War is a distraction from the primary competition with China and that aid to Ukraine diverts limited resources desperately needed to counter the Chinese military threat. In this, other “[Pacific prioritizers](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/managing-trade-offs-between-military-aid-taiwan-and-ukraine)
” have joined Colby.

Importantly, the administration no longer argues that aid is being abused and [that Ukraine is corrupt](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jr-ukraine-corrupt-comments-b2068536.html)
. Funds could also come from the [defense loan mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1340)
 recently [established](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-envoys-reach-deal-150-billion-euro-arms-fund-2025-05-21/)
 by the European Union.

The deal with NATO meets one of the White House’s concerns, that support for Ukraine has been too costly to U.S. However, the DOD’s reluctance to lift the pause is evident in [its terse announcement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4236261/statement-by-chief-pentagon-spokesman-sean-parnell-on-ukraine-military-aid/)
, saying that it was done “at President Trump’s direction” and that the DOD would continue its evaluation “of military shipments across the globe.”

Under the deal with NATO, the politics and financial realities of U.S."

Ukraine says it has uncovered major arms corruption

The SBU said defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided

**Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m).**

The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.

It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.

Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.

Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

The SBU said an investigation had "exposed" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, "who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells".

"According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement," it said.

The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, "not a single artillery shell" was ever sent.

One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said.

Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.

Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.

The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.

In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.

Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a [2022 corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022)
 by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.

But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference. It is one of only 10 countries steadily climbing Transparency International's ranking, rising 28 places in a decade.

Law enforcement teams search homes and offices in multiple cities at Kyiv’s request, but no arrests have been made so far.

Raids were conducted in several areas, including Sofia, in response to a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating suspected overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv.

Bulgarian authorities [searched](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/947266-no-arrests-yet-during-searches-of-arms-dealers-at-ukraine-s-request-interior-m)
 the homes and offices of arms dealers across the country Tuesday as part of a corruption investigation launched by Ukraine, officials said.

The raids, carried out in multiple regions including Sofia, followed a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is probing alleged overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv.

Acting Interior Ministry Secretary General Miroslav Rashkov said no arrests had been made and that the searches were being conducted under the supervision of the National Investigation Service. Many deliveries are routed through intermediaries before reaching Ukrainian buyers, a process now under scrutiny in several countries.

Rashkov said the operation remained underway Tuesday afternoon and declined to speculate on possible arrests or charges.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reports that the State Department approved $322 million in weapons sales to Ukraine, including supplies, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles and surface-to-air missile systems. (<image:0>) The CSIS analysis discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including the announcements and deliveries of weapons.

The search result from forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States. The aid includes various armaments, ammunition, and equipment. The United States has provided small arms and ammunition seized from Iranian forces. The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

Future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict

*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/arms-trafficking/)
    
*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/violence-fragility/)
    

*   [! What this means for organized crime, and specifically the smuggling of weapons and ammunition into Europe is unclear, but by using scenario modelling we can divine insights and provide concrete recommendations.

On 20–21 January 2025, the GI-TOC hosted a conference in Brussels to discuss three potential trajectories of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the ramifications of each on arms trafficking dynamics in Europe.

The conference gamed three scenarios – a peace agreement, a stalemate conflict and a decisive victory for Ukraine or Russia. Some leakage must be expected, and understanding this reality should persuade policymakers to act sooner rather than wait for a trigger event in a European city.

#### Key points

*   Draft, support and implement policy measures that reduce arms trafficking risks in Ukraine, including (when it is formulated) Ukraine’s demobilization law, and its security sector reform and veteran policy.
*   Improve Europe-wide operational capabilities in terms of information sharing, coordination and access to data.
*   The arms trafficking trade is likely to be multifaceted: a small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors.
*   ‘Traditional’ organized crime may be involved in arms trafficking alongside other more lucrative activities, like the drug trade, but ex-military personnel may form a new class of ‘brokers’, using connections with other military and politicians to set up larger-scale operations.
*   Tailor responses that recognize demand is king: the right kit for the right customer. <image:1112>\

Smoke on the horizon: Trends in arms trafficking from the conflict in Ukraine\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)

[! Participants were asked to respond, from the perspective of organized crime, law enforcement and multilateral policymakers, to emergent arms trafficking dynamics, working through various turns to discover second- and third-order implications. Asking participants to step outside their role and think like a criminal is rewarding and illuminates the discussion, while building trust and personal connections.

The purpose of this exercise was to provide policymakers with a forward-looking perspective that would map the potential risk of arms trafficking across a range of situations, point up gaps in responses and develop specific and measurable policy response options for national authorities to implement with the aim of reducing the risks of illicit firearms markets in Europe from the conflict.

Fostering international cooperation and information-sharing was also a primary goal of the conference. More than 60 high-level stakeholders attended from a range of organizations focusing on arms trafficking.

#### Understanding the risk

Understanding of the risks of arms trafficking arising from the conflict has improved since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Yet recent research suggests criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes and supply chains, and the scale of the problem is much larger than past occurrences of large-scale diversion, such as the Balkans and Afghanistan. Experts and policymakers in neighbouring and other European countries continue to express their concerns about the threat of large-scale diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine. An overarching conclusion was that policy responses must flexible and scalable from the start.

**Use lessons learned (and learn new ones)**

The conference highlighted the fact that many policy bodies in Europe have a deep and multilayered understanding of the legacy of the Balkans conflict on arms trafficking trends in Europe."

! Taking into account the EU recommendations and ensuring the proper functioning of the Coordination Centre, we are making our contribution to the development of the European security architecture,” the Minister added.

In his turn, Ambassador Petr Mareš, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairmanship and Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine, said that the issue of arms trafficking is becoming increasingly acute due to russia’s full-scale invasion, but the creation of the Coordination Centre will help to effectively counteract this problem. Achieving synergy in combating illicit arms trafficking is of great importance to us, as we are aware that the war is ongoing, and only through joint efforts can we ensure security in Ukraine and Europe,” he said.

! <image:1117>

In response, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stressed that, with the assistance of international partners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is implementing a number of joint projects aimed at building the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies.

Harshet Virk, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Programme Office in Ukraine, stressed that owing to the coordinated and efficient efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, not a single weapon was trafficked to the European Union: “I sincerely congratulate you on the establishment of the Coordination Centre – this is an important step in the fight against crime and illicit arms trafficking. <image:1118>

Harshet Virk noted that her team will continue to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by providing software and organising relevant trainings.

Maura O’Sullivan, the Acting Head of the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, said that the Centre is a reliable solution for monitoring the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the area of combating illicit arms trafficking: “We are ready to continue to support you and facilitate the rapid exchange of information. The main tasks of the Centre are:

– processing and systematisation of information received;

– coordinating the actions of state authorities, institutions and organisations on combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– ensuring the exchange of information between the authorities of Ukraine and partner countries;

– obtaining complete information about weapons;

– improving the legal framework for combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– identifying ways and means of solving problematic issues.

## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine arms sales US aid")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reports that the State Department approved $322 million in weapons sales to Ukraine, including supplies, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles and surface-to-air missile systems. (<image:0>) The CSIS analysis discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including the announcements and deliveries of weapons. (<image:4789>, <image:4790>) The article mentions the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) as mechanisms for providing funds to Ukraine.

The search result from forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States. The aid includes various armaments, ammunition, and equipment. The United States has provided small arms and ammunition seized from Iranian forces. The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

Ukraine Weapons Sales

Weapons Sales are presented as a Trend-Indicator Value based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons such as aircraft, air defence systems, anti-submarine warfare weapons, armoured vehicles, artillery, engines, missiles, sensors, satellites, ships and others. The indicator aims to represent the transfer value of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

|     | Actual | Previous | Highest | Lowest | Dates | Unit | Frequency |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 34.00 | 72.00 | 1491.00 | 34.00 | 1992 - 2023 | SIPRI TIV Million | Yearly |     |

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alexander Cook

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).
    
*   **North Korea** exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine."

The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.
