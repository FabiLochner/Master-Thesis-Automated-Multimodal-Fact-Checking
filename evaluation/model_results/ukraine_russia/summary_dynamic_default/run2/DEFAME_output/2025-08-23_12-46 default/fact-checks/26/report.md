NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, about an abrupt end to a White House visit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg).

Al Jazeera published an article on February 28, 2025, detailing a heated meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred at the White House in February 2025. However, the provided articles do not contain any quotes from Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. The specific statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not mentioned in the provided sources.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of India published an article on March 7, 2025, discussing disinformation related to a dispute between Zelenskyy, Trump, and JD Vance in the Oval Office, but it does not contain the quote in the claim ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms)). The Associated Press published a fact-check article on August 22, 2024, stating that Zelenskyy did not say U.S. troops needed to fight in Ukraine ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159)).

Voice of America (VOA) published an article on March 2, 2023, fact-checking a claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send its citizens to "fight and die in Ukraine," stating the claim is false and taken out of context from a February 24, 2023, press conference ![image 4713](media/2025-08-23_12-52-1755953549-022891.jpg) ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)).


## Elaboration
The new evidence further supports the conclusion that the claim is not verifiable. The search results did not find any evidence that Zelenskyy made the specific statement in February 2025. Moreover, a VOA fact-check from March 2, 2023, explicitly debunked a similar claim, stating that Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send its citizens to "fight and die in Ukraine."


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February 2025, but no evidence of the specific quote. Subsequent searches confirmed the absence of the quote and found a fact-check debunking a similar statement.

The claim is demonstrably false because there is no evidence to support the statement attributed to Zelenskyy, and there is evidence that a similar claim was debunked. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy. Furthermore, a fact-check from Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) debunked a similar statement.
