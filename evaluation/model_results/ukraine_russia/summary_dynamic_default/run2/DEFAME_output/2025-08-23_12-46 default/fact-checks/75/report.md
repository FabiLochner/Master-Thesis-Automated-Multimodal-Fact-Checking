## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the incursion beginning on the night of August 5-6, 2024. Newsweek reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia claimed to have seen evidence of American mercenaries participating in the incursion, and the U.S. denied involvement. The claim aligns with these reports.

The image in the claim shows individuals with what appears to be US flags on their uniforms. This visual evidence supports the claim that American mercenaries were involved. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the exact date and location of the photo.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the identity of the individuals depicted.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim appears in articles from Apostrophe.ua ([https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880)), charter97.org ([https://charter97.org/ru/news/2022/9/9/514837/](https://charter97.org/ru/news/2022/9/9/514837/)), and cripo.com.ua ([https://cripo.com.ua/vojna-s-rf/rossyjskye-vojska-begut-pod-natyskom-vsu-mnenye-ekspertov-y-rossyjskyh-voennyh/](https://cripo.com.ua/vojna-s-rf/rossyjskye-vojska-begut-pod-natyskom-vsu-mnenye-ekspertov-y-rossyjskyh-voennyh/)). These articles, published in September 2022, discuss the Ukrainian army's victory in Balakleya and the Russian retreat. The image (![image 24](media/75.jpg)) shows Ukrainian soldiers with a dead Russian soldier. The cripo.com.ua article also contains an image of a sign that says "Kursk".


## Elaboration
The reverse image search reveals that the image in the claim is from September 2022 and depicts Ukrainian soldiers, not American mercenaries, in the Balakleya region. The image's context is unrelated to the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as stated in the claim.

The claim is therefore demonstrably false. The image has been taken out of context and used to support a different narrative.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image used in the claim is from September 2022 and shows Ukrainian soldiers in the Balakleya region, not American mercenaries in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The image has been taken out of context and misrepresented. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. The image provided in the claim is from September 2022 and depicts Ukrainian soldiers in the Balakleya region, as evidenced by reverse image searches ([https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880), [https://charter97.org/ru/news/2022/9/9/514837/](https://charter97.org/ru/news/2022/9/9/514837/), [https://cripo.com.ua/vojna-s-rf/rossyjskye-vojska-begut-pod-natyskom-vsu-mnenye-ekspertov-y-rossyjskyh-voennyh/](https://cripo.com.ua/vojna-s-rf/rossyjskye-vojska-begut-pod-natyskom-vsu-mnenye-ekspertov-y-rossyjskyh-voennyh/)). This contradicts the claim that the image shows American mercenaries in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024.
