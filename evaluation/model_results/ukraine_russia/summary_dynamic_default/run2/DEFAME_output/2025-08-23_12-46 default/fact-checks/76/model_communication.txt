President Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America’s deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal.

The shift comes as the Pentagon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade.

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Cooperation Between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia: Current and Potential Future Threats to America
=========================================================================================================

Each one of these states threatens U.S. To make matters worse, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are increasing their support for one another. How likely is this scenario?

This paper examines the state of cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and identifies paths that could lead to their closer cooperation—and paths that would not. A concluding section draws policy implications.

### **Cooperation in Pairs So Far**

Although China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are now often viewed as an aligned group, cooperation among them has been almost entirely bilateral so far. Security Council resolution banning the practice.29 A few years ago, Pyongyang was estimated to receive $500 million annually this way, which it spends on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.30 China also illicitly facilitates the export of millions of barrels of oil to North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers.31

While China’s support lessens the economic pressure that international sanctions put on Pyongyang, China’s security commitment is essential for it.32 Beijing also defends North Korea in international forums, vetoing resolutions that would tighten sanctions, and sometimes introducing measures to loosen them.33

There are limits, however, to cooperation in this dyad. For example, China has to date refused to provide North Korea with nuclear-weapons technology and expertise, and it has supported some sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s nuclear program.34 Some analysts even concluded that North Korea carried out its ballistic missile test close to Japan in 2022 to demonstrate that it had the long-range capacity to strike areas of value to Beijing.35

Mostly, China must manage the risk of disaster in North Korea."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that in March 2024, President Joe Biden approved a classified nuclear strategic plan to prepare the United States for potential nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat)). This supports the claim that Biden ordered preparations for possible nuclear confrontations with these countries.

The evidence also highlights the ongoing cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea, with North Korea providing munitions to Russia in exchange for food ([https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/cooperation-between-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-current-and-potential-future-threats-to-america?lang=en](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/cooperation-between-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-current-and-potential-future-threats-to-america?lang=en)). This context suggests a potential for increased tensions and the need for strategic planning.
