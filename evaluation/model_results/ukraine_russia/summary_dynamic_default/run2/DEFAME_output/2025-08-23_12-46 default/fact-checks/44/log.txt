The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to a Yahoo News article, Biden did not announce that no more aid would be provided for Hurricane Helene victims; instead, he stated he would ask Congress for a supplemental aid bill ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html)). The article also mentions an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine, not $2.4 billion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
