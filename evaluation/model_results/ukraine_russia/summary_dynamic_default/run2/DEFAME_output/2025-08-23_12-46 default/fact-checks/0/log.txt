Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/): 
Content: The Journal.ie published on March 26, 2025, debunks a fake Hull Daily Mail front page that was widely shared on social media. The fake front page, dated March 13, 2025, claimed that "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain." <image:4640> The article states that the Hull Daily Mail's parent company confirmed the headline was fake. The real front page from that date had a different headline. The article is written by Cormac Fitzgerald. <image:4642>

The claim '<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.' is false.
