## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Reuters reports that he was sentenced to 14 years for treason, after being found guilty of corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine, and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation" (![image 381](media/2025-08-06_17-38-1754501881-577176.jpg)). The Moscow Times states that he was sentenced to an additional 13 years and six months for treason, after previously being sentenced to three and a half years for burning the Quran (![image 386](media/2025-08-06_17-38-1754501885-751911.jpg)). Meduza also reports that he was sentenced to 13.5 years for treason.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the Reuters report indicates that the 14-year sentence was for treason, not for burning the Quran. The Moscow Times states that he was sentenced to an additional 13.5 years for treason, after previously being sentenced to 3.5 years for burning the Quran.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that a man was sentenced in November 2024. However, the initial 14-year sentence was for treason, not burning the Quran. He was also sentenced to an additional 13.5 years for treason, after previously being sentenced to 3.5 years for burning the Quran.
