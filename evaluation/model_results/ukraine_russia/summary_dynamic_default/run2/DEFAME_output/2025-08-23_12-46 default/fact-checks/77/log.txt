Useful result: From [Source](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade): 
Content: The Polish Ministry of Defence announced a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17. The parade will showcase military hardware, including South Korean-made K2 battle tanks, Polish-produced Krab self-propelled gun-howitzers, and US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks. The event is an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East." <image:25> is not mentioned in the article.

The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image shows a military parade in Poland on August 14, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations, which is confirmed by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)). However, the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
