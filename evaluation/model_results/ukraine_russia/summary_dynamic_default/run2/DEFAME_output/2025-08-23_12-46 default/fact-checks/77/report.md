## Elaboration
The image depicts a military parade in Poland. The parade was part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations on August 15, 2024, and included a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17. The event showcased military hardware and was an expression of strength in the face of threats.

The claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence. While the event was held in the context of "threats from the East," the evidence does not explicitly state that the parade was a preparation for war.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, as the parade did occur on August 14, 2024. However, the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a military parade in Poland on August 14, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade showcased military hardware and was held in the context of "threats from the East." However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia.
