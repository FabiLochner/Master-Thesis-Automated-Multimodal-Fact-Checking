### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's income for 2022 rose to 12.42 million hryvnias ($306,000) due to improved rent collection and the sale of government bonds. Most of the income came from his salary, bank interest, and rent from his properties. The article was published on March 29.

The Hindustan Times, published on March 2, 2025, discusses Volodymyr Zelensky's wealth, mentioning his background in entertainment and his income.

([https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/is-zelensky-a-billionaire-know-about-his-net-worth-as-trump-rages-over-us-funding-to-ukraine-101740820041614.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/is-zelensky-a-billionaire-know-about-his-net-worth-as-trump-rages-over-us-funding-to-ukraine-101740820041614.html)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The claim is largely false. A Yahoo News article fact-checked the claim and rated it as "False" ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html)). Zelenskyy's asset declaration showed fewer than 15 properties, none in the U.S., no private planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000.

Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms)). He declared whole or part ownership of 14 properties in his 2024 asset declaration. Zelenskyy's income for 2022 rose to $306,000 ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-reports-his-income-increased-2022-2024-03-29/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-reports-his-income-increased-2022-2024-03-29/)).


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including a fact-check from Yahoo News, contradict the specifics of the claim. Zelenskyy does not own 15 homes, a $35 million home in Florida, or have $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. His income is also significantly less than $11 million per month.

`false`
