The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the evidence confirms a Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and the presence of destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war, the image in question was not found in any of the image searches. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
