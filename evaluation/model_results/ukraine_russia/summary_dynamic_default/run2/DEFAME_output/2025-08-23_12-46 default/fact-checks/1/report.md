## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
One article from AOL, published on February 20, 2025, fact-checks the claim and states it is false, with the Eagle's Nest still owned by the Free State of Bavaria (![image 1524](media/2025-08-07_18-47-1754592456-339264.jpg)). Another article from EADaily, published on February 8, 2025, claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for â‚¬14.2 million through an offshore company (![image 1548](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592484-932343.jpg)).

A third article, published on February 27, 2025, by Gwara Media, debunks a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthelemy island, stating the evidence is fake and the villa was sold to a French company in October 2024 (![image 1552](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592492-084293.jpg), ![image 1553](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592495-928314.jpg), ![image 1554](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592496-123937.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. One article from AOL states the claim is false, while an article from EADaily claims Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest. The Gwara Media article debunks a similar claim about a villa purchase, suggesting the possibility of fabricated evidence.

The AOL article indicates the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, which contradicts the claim. However, the EADaily article supports the claim.

Given the conflicting information and the presence of potentially fabricated evidence, the claim's veracity is uncertain. Further investigation is needed to determine the authenticity of the conflicting reports.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals conflicting information. One source states the claim is false, while another supports it. Given the conflicting information and the presence of potentially fabricated evidence, the claim's veracity is uncertain.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is disputed. While one source, AOL, states the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, contradicting the claim, another source, EADaily, supports it. Given the conflicting information and the potential for fabricated evidence, the claim is considered false.
