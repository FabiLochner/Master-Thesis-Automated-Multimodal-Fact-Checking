A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=122143466432378597&id=61561357930276)
 claims Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy bought deceased genocidal Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler’s home, the Eagle’s Nest.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence for this claim.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming Zelenskyy bought Hitler’s residence, known as the Eagle’s Nest. One user wrote that it was acquired by a company owned by Zelenskyy.

“According to German media, Kelsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle’s Nest, was acquired by the offshore company San Tommaso, owned by the President of Ukraine. If Zelenskyy had bought the Eagle’s Nest, media outlets would have covered it, yet none have. IMBY will take legal action against the authors of this misinformation,” reads the statement.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a joint press conference with the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Kyiv on February 10, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The deal was completed at the end of December, and the building was purchased for €14.2 million euros. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is a fake, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management. The Kelsteinhaus, located in the mountains of Bavaria, was a gift to Adolf Hitler on his 50th birthday."

Zelensky bought Hitler's Eagle's Nest residence in the Bavarian Alps — Mass media
=================================================================================

February 8th, 2025  
12:44

![](//img2.eadaily.com/c650x400/o/94e/7614af3a798ea9dbf663f5b6d4b54.jpeg)

Zelensky is Hitler today. It is alleged that Zelya bought the Kelsteinhaus mansion, also known as the Eagle's Nest, at the end of December.

The transaction amount amounted to € 14.2 million, the buyer was the offshore company San Tomaso SRL, owned by Zelensky. However, the detached Kelsteinhaus mansion in the mountains was extremely expensive to maintain, and therefore the Bavarian authorities decided to get rid of it.

The Eagle's Nest, presented to Hitler on his 50th birthday, was used by the German Fuhrer as the main headquarters from December 10, 1944 to January 15, 1945.

The building was practically not damaged during the Second World War and subsequently functioned as a tourist attraction — there is a museum and a restaurant.

Earlier, [**EADaily**](https://eadaily.com/)
 reported that the head of the Kiev regime, Vladimir Zelensky, is [not going](/en/news/2025/02/07/the-right-of-the-first-night-in-the-usa-zelensky-set-the-terms-of-the-deal-on-minerals)
 to give Ukraine's minerals to US President **Donald Trump** or other Western partners, it can only be about their joint development in close partnership.

Russian disinformation campaigns targeting the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, continuously spread fakes about him buying luxurious real estate while his country is suffering under Russian aggression. This time, pro-Russian sources produced a fake that says that Zelenskyy purchased a luxury villa on Saint Barthélemy island and already started building a bunker there. Important”), and others published the news that Volodymyr Zelenskyy supposedly bought a villa with a territory of 436 square meters on the island of Saint Barthelemy in France. The purchase agreement, then, was supposedly signed by Svitlana Pishchanko, who acted as a legal representative for the President of Ukraine. 

“News” also said that the local company Mancar is already building a bunker for Zelenskyy on the island. 

As evidence, Telegram authors referenced unknown French sources and attached a video with a French voiceover that includes several pictures of some real estate and a photo of a document’s pages (supposedly a purchase agreement). 

!зображення до посту: Debunking Russian fakes. No, Zelenskyy didn&#8217;t buy villa on &#8220;island of billionaires” <image:1552>

Next, we’ve researched the documents the news offers as evidence of the Stellae Villa purchase. No, Zelenskyy didn&#8217;t buy villa on &#8220;island of billionaires” <image:1553>

We wrote to Michel Ciffreo to ask about the authenticity of this document, and he told us that the document is fake. 

!No, Zelenskyy didn't buy villa on "island of billionaires”  <image:1554>

Responding to a [request](https://www.tf1info.fr/international/verif-non-guerre-ukraine-russie-volodymyr-zelensky-n-a-pas-achete-de-villa-luxueuse-a-saint-barthelemy-sibarth-real-estate-2343906.html)
 from a French TV channel TF1, the real estate company Sibarth Real Estate reported that they sold the villa in October 2024 and reiterated that the document is fake. 

They noted: “The buyer is not Altorante LTD, but a French company with French stakeholders that do not have any connection with Ukraine” and “on the territory of the villa, there are no \[repair works\], as opposed to what’s said in the video.” 

Conclusion: Fake

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
One article from AOL, published on February 20, 2025, fact-checks the claim and states it is false, with the Eagle's Nest still owned by the Free State of Bavaria (<image:1524>). Another article from EADaily, published on February 8, 2025, claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for €14.2 million through an offshore company (<image:1548>).

A third article, published on February 27, 2025, by Gwara Media, debunks a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthelemy island, stating the evidence is fake and the villa was sold to a French company in October 2024 (<image:1552>, <image:1553>, <image:1554>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information. One article from AOL states the claim is false, while an article from EADaily claims Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest. The Gwara Media article debunks a similar claim about a villa purchase, suggesting the possibility of fabricated evidence.

The AOL article indicates the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, which contradicts the claim. However, the EADaily article supports the claim.

Given the conflicting information and the presence of potentially fabricated evidence, the claim's veracity is uncertain. Further investigation is needed to determine the authenticity of the conflicting reports.

```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy Eagle's Nest purchase")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
One article from AOL, published on February 20, 2025, fact-checks the claim and states it is false, with the Eagle's Nest still owned by the Free State of Bavaria (<image:1524>). Another article from EADaily, published on February 8, 2025, claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for €14.2 million through an offshore company (<image:1548>).

A third article, published on February 27, 2025, by Gwara Media, debunks a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthelemy island, stating the evidence is fake and the villa was sold to a French company in October 2024 (<image:1552>, <image:1553>, <image:1554>).


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. One article from AOL states the claim is false, while an article from EADaily claims Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest. The Gwara Media article debunks a similar claim about a villa purchase, suggesting the possibility of fabricated evidence.

The AOL article indicates the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, which contradicts the claim. However, the EADaily article supports the claim.

Given the conflicting information and the presence of potentially fabricated evidence, the claim's veracity is uncertain. Further investigation is needed to determine the authenticity of the conflicting reports.

Content: "<image:1595>

A Dutch journalist's claim that a Russian strike allegedly killed 18 British special forces soldiers and injured another 25 has sparked a wildfire online, drawing over 2.5 million readers.

Sonja van den Ende, a Dutch journalist barred from entering Ukraine, has spread false information claiming the death of a British military unit during a Russian missile strike in Odesa, [reported](https://www.facebook.com/100002112339132/posts/7875505409196459/?rdid=O497WKy9ZWbwIThj)
 Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk.

"Sometimes, it happens that you're so discredited that you're banned from entering Ukraine for many years, but that doesn't stop you from creating sensational fake news about the war in Ukraine," Pletenchuk said, commenting on the Dutch journalist's post.

He pointed out that French journalist ‘buried an entire unit of foreign soldiers’ who were allegedly in Odesa.

"In her note, Sonja van den Ende 'killed' an entire British SAS unit in Odesa. She reached over 2.5 million readers on her X page, claiming that 'the Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers and injured another 25'," Pletenchuk commented.

He noted that the Dutch journalist provided no evidence for her claims.

Sonja van den Ende is a Dutch journalist who, since 2015, has been actively spreading narratives sympathetic to Russia. She has also written about supposed Ukrainian "biolabs," Zelensky's threats to Donbas, and claims that Ukrainian Armed Forces are shelling peaceful cities.

The Dutch journalist loves traveling around Russia and frequently praises the country on her social media.

They verified this information in the press service of the Tavria Operational grouping of troops, where they denied the presence of British special forces in Odesa and the event itself. Speaker of the Ukrainian Navy, Dmytro Pletenchuk, also denied this information.

Propagandists spread such fakes in order to support their information campaign about “foreign mercenaries” in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, this information is not true.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that claims about British Special Forces casualties in the Odessa region of Ukraine have been made and subsequently debunked by Ukrainian military sources. Specifically, a claim by Dutch journalist Sonja van den Ende about 18 British special forces soldiers being killed in Odesa was debunked. Other claims about the destruction of a British SAS group and the capture of British officers have also surfaced.

The image in the claim shows coffins draped with the Union Jack. However, the evidence does not provide any information to verify the image's context or the claim that it depicts the coffins of British Special Forces killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that claims of British Special Forces casualties in Odessa have been made, but the specific details of the claim, including the image's context, cannot be verified.

사진 한 장이 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공 이후 우크라이나에게 격추당한 러시아 전투기를 촬영한 것이라는 주장과 함께 소셜미디어상에서 반복적으로 공유됐다. 하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국에서 에어쇼 도중 발생한 사고 현장을 촬영한 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

문제의 사진은 2022년 2월 24일 "우크라이나 방공부대에 격추당하는 러시아 전투기"라는 글귀와 함께 [페이스북](https://archive.ph/sJbrs)
에 공유됐다.

문제의 주장이 공유된 페이스북 게시글 스크린샷. 2022년 3월 10일 캡쳐. ( AFP)

해당 사진은 우크라이나 정부군이 2022년 2월 24일 러시아 전투기 5대와 헬기 한 대를 친러시아 반군이 장악한 우크라이나 동부 지역에서 격추했다고 [발표](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/ukraine-claims-downed-five-russian-planes-helicopter-1084634.html)
한 이후부터 온라인상에 공유됐다.

동일한 사진이 유사한 주장과 함께 트위터 [여기](https://archive.ph/i2vgR)
와 [여기](https://archive.ph/7gu4S)
에도 공유됐고, 우크라이나 정부군이 발표한 내용을 보도한 한 국내 온라인 매체의 기사에도 [게시](https://archive.ph/JIuGU)
됐다.

하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국의 한 에어쇼 도중 촬영된 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

### 에어쇼 사고

러시아 포털사이트 얀덱스 역 이미지 검색을 통해 페이스북에 잘못된 주장과 함께 공유된 사진과 일치하는 사진을 항공 사진 데이터베이스 [Air Team Images](https://archive.md/Net24)
에서 찾을 수 있었다.

두 사진 비교를 통해 페이스북에 공유된 사진이 좌우 반전된 것을 알 수 있다.

이 웹사이트는 칼 포드(Carl Ford)라는 인물이 1993년 7월 24일 영국의 페어포드시(Fairford)에서 해당 사진을 촬영했다고 소개하고 있다.

사진에는 "러시아 미그-29 전투기 2대가 충돌한 사고 장면을 촬영한 사진. 사고로 인한 사망자나 심한 부상자는 발생하지 않았다"라는 설명이 붙었다.

다음은 페이스북에 공유된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우)을 비교한 것이다.

페이스북에 게시된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우) 비교 ( AFP)

해당 사진을 촬영한 포드는 동일한 사진을 2015년 10월 15일 온라인 사진 공유 및 관리 웹사이트 [플리커](https://www.flickr.com/photos/53277566@N06/5520340518/in/photostream/)
에도 게시했는데, 이 사진에도 유사한 설명이 붙었다.

포드는 AFP와 서면 인터뷰에서 "이 사진은 내가 1993년 7월 24일 촬영한 11장의 사진 중 하나다. 촬영에는 니콘 F.3 HP 카메라를 이용했다."라고 말했다.

영국 일간지 인디펜던트(The Independent)는 1993년 7월 26일 자 [기사](https://archive.md/uJxrQ)
를 통해 포드가 촬영한 사진에 등장하는 사고를 보도했는데 이 기사에는 "영국 공군이 이번 주말 열린 세계 최대 규모의 에어쇼에서 발생한 러시아 전투기 공중 충돌 사고의 원인 규명을 위한 조사에 착수했다"라는 내용이 담겨있다.

해당 사고는 1993년 영국 의회가 발표한 [보고서](https://archive.md/U6NNx)
에서도 언급됐다.

###### [Ukraine’s F-16 jets intercept Russian missiles in apparent first](/global/europe/2024/08/27/ukraines-f-16-jets-intercept-russian-missiles-in-apparent-first/)

###### Russia fired dozens of missiles and drones across Ukraine on Tuesday, including some that officials said were shot down by Western-supplied F-16 jets.

The Defense Ministry has opened an investigation into the crash.

Earlier Thursday, Russia conducted a heavy aerial attack on Ukraine for the third time in four days, again launching missiles and scores of drones that mostly were intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said.

Russian forces fired five missiles and 74 Shahed drones at Ukrainian targets, an air force statement said. Four of those Russian missiles were shot down by F-16s, the statement said.

The crash was the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine, where they arrived at the end of last month. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces destroyed three Ukrainian [sea drones](https://www.militarytimes.com/unmanned/2024/03/06/the-sea-drone-thats-lifting-ukraine-morale-as-it-hunts-russian-ships/)
 aimed at the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev added that four Ukrainian aerial drones and three sea drones were destroyed “at a significant distance” from the peninsula’s shore.

In the meantime, Ukraine’s Army General Staff acknowledged Thursday Ukraine’s involvement in strikes this week on oil depots deep inside Russia, where blazes broke out.

The attacks in the Rostov and Kirov regions were part of Ukraine’s effort to disrupt logistical infrastructure supporting Russia’s war machine.

Ukraine F-16 jet crashes during Russian attack, killing pilot
=============================================================

By Illia Novikov, The Associated Press

 Aug 29, 2024

! officials told The Associated Press at the end of last month that the first of a batch of F-16s promised by European countries [had arrived](https://www.militarytimes.com/global/2024/08/01/first-group-of-us-made-f-16-jets-arrive-in-ukraine-officials-say/)
 in Ukraine.

Military analysts have said their arrival [won’t be a game-changer](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-f16s-what-to-know-224d96ff2ad4f416d3969676a55876e2)

KYIV, Ukraine — One of the handful of F-16 warplanes that Ukraine has received from its Western partners to help fight Russia’s invasion has crashed, Ukraine’s Army General Staff said Thursday. The pilot died.

The fighter jet went down Monday, when Russia launched a major missile and drone barrage at Ukraine, a military statement posted on Facebook said. That number is dwarfed by the Russian jet fighter fleet, which is around 10 times larger.

Ukraine [needs at least 130](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-offensive-aid-16e276766b7100485fe97b674700ac6c)
 F-16 fighter jets to neutralize Russian air power, Kyiv officials say.

U.S. But Ukrainian officials welcomed them as offering an opportunity to hit back at Russia’s air superiority.

Ukraine has until now been using Soviet-era warplanes, and its pilots underwent intense training on the F-16s in the West for months."

*   Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for **more F-16 fighter jets and more training for pilots to fly them** as he revealed the western warplanes were used to **shoot down Russian missiles** during the last two days’ heavy attacks on Ukraine.
    
*   Ukrainian drones set several oil tanks on fire at the **Glubokinskaya oil depot in the Kamensky district of Russia’s Rostov region**, several Russian Telegram channels monitored by Reuters reported on Wednesday. Russian officials regularly say damage was **caused by debris** from a drone that was shot down, **rather than admitting** that the drone hit its target.
    
*   The governor of Russia’s **Belgorod** region – which **borders Ukraine and partly Ukrainian-occupied Kursk** – said he was aware of reports that the Ukrainian army had tried to cross the border. He claimed Russian forces had redeployed about 30,000 troops because of the Kursk incursion, and that Ukraine had taken **594** **PoWs** there, [write Luke Harding and Pjotr Sauer](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-kryvyi-rih-zaporizhzhia-strikes-blackouts)

*   The **Kursk nuclear plant** is especially vulnerable because it **does not have a good enough roof over its reactor**, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday. Rostov’s governor, Vasily Golubev, said several Ukraine-launched drones were destroyed over the region, which lies across the border from Ukraine’s Luhansk oblast. The Baza channel, which is close to Russia’s security services, said **three tanks were burning after strikes by two drones**.
    
*   The attack came while tanks were still on fire at another Rostov oil depot, in the Proletarsk district, 10 days after the depot was attacked, Russian Telegram channels report."

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

### Emergence

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Emergence")\
\]

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")
, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")
 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)
 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Tise-2)
 By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")
.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
[\[8\]](#cite_note-igo40-8)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")
, a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production")
 in Belgium by [SABCA](/wiki/SABCA "SABCA")
.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 In 1921 the [Air Ministry](/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry")
 ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport")
, and later by [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
, on services to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris")
 and [Brussels](/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")
.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")

 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)
 while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](/wiki/Biplane "Biplane")
 with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle")
 engine.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23)
 For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34")
 biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Flight180823-24)
 A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway")
 ordered a batch of nine.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")

 [Pan Am](/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am")
 opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38")
 through [Sikorsky S-42](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42")

[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)

, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)

 flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")
 and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[\[40\]](#cite_note-Mellberg-40)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")

 British aircraft manufacturers were tied up to fulfill military requirements, and had no free capacity to address other matters though the war.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation")
 (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways")
 (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine")
 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland")
, involved in the first jet fighters development.

After a brief contest, the Type I design was given to the [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
, building on a "100 ton [bomber](/wiki/Bomber "Bomber")
" submission.[\[49\]](#cite_note-Barnes324-49)
 This evolved into the [Bristol Brabazon](/wiki/Bristol_Brabazon "Bristol Brabazon")

 engine.[\[50\]](#cite_note-Phipp67-50)

The Type II was split between the [de Havilland Dove](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dove "De Havilland Dove")
 and [Airspeed Ambassador](/wiki/Airspeed_Ambassador "Airspeed Ambassador")
 conventional piston designs,[\[51\]](#cite_note-Phipp75-51)

, although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[\[54\]](#cite_note-Barnes347-54)
 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")

, not well understood at the time.[\[58\]](#cite_note-withey_fatigue-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)
 The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[\[61\]](#cite_note-Phipp93-61)
[\[62\]](#cite_note-Jackson464-62)

By the 1960s, the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market, not regained by later designs like the [BAC 1-11](/wiki/BAC_1-11 "BAC 1-11")

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\
\]

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, [Lockheed L-1011](/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011")
, [Boeing 707](/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")
), air ambulance ([USAF](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")
/[USN](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")
 [McDonnell Douglas DC-9](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")
), [reconnaissance](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance")
 ([Embraer ERJ 145](/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family")
, [Saab 340](/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340")
, and [Boeing 737](/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")
), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")
.[\[75\]](#cite_note-75)

Market
------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Market")\

Since it began, the [jet airliner](/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner")
 market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)")
 going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel")

 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Manufacturer | 2016 orders and deliveries[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86) |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deliveries | values ($bn) | net orders | backlog |
| Boeing | 726 | 57.8 | 563 | 5,660 |

| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")
, itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth")
 but also [supply and demand](/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand")
 balance and [oil prices](/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price")
, while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing")
 help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old : there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[\[87\]](#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87)
 Oil prices and [airshow](/wiki/Airshow "Airshow")
 orders are trending together.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

In 2020, deliveries were down by more than 50% compared to 2019 due to the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation](/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_aviation "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation")

Main article: [Aircraft cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Overhead bins")\
\]

Further information: [Overhead storage](/wiki/Overhead_storage "Overhead storage")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg/250px-Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Overhead_bins_(6389156645).jpg)

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

Baggage holds

 front lower compartment. Note the rollers for [ULDs](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

The Museum's collection holds a variety of different airplanes which help tell the story of flight. Our collection of commercial aircraft, such as the well-known Boeing 747, help tell the history of America by air. Learn more about some of these aircraft below. 

From the Wright Brothers to Today

The Airplane's Family Tree


------------------------------

Did you know that the parts of airplanes today can be traced directly back to the Wright Flyer and the work of Orville and Wilbur Wright? In this episode of STEM in 30, we trace the family tree of the airplane from that first flight on December 17, 1903, to today—all from inside a United Airlines 76.

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918. 

[View Jenny record](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/curtiss-jn-4d-jenny/nasm_A19190006000)

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

[![View of red, U.S. Air Mail postage stamp that has an error of the Jenny biplane facing upside down.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14102h.jpg?itok=MBm-nefV)](/multimedia-gallery/14102hjpg)

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money.

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

[![Wooden biplane-airboat model with space for two people, a passenger and the pilot. Flaglets are placed on the front structure in between the wings.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14081h.jpg?itok=Zl93ospv)](/multimedia-gallery/14081hjpg)

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

A model of the Boeing 40A.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

_**Rolls-Royce Dart**_

First introduced in 1948, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop combined the power of jet propulsion with the efficiency of propellers. It was widely used in the first generation of turboprop-powered aircraft, including the British Vickers Viscount and the Dutch Fokker F-27. The Dart enabled these and other new airliners to lower airline operating costs and bring greater speed and comfort to passengers traveling on short-to-medium length routes.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999. 

[Look inside the Museum's 747](https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/v20170188004-panojpg)

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles).

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

CNN  — 

Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.

But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.

There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.

China has always claimed neutrality in [Russia’s war on Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. They had been fighting for only three days.

The role of foreign fighters
----------------------------

Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.

A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.

In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.

A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.

“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.

Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.

Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.

“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. [](#maincontent)

CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.

The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”

But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.

The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.

One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.

It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.

It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.

Why the timing matters
----------------------

Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.

The timing is important.

It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.

Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.

From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.

But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.

Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.

“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.

“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.

Beijing certainly saw it like that.

“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.

Ad Feedback One of the men recounted the chaotic moments that lead up to their capture in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.

“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”

The men surrendered. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.

As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.

Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood."

Moscow stages largest Victory Day parade since start of Ukraine war with Putin using celebrations to justify invasion

Russian troops fighting in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.

After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

Chinese troops march through Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day parade in on Friday. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent [admissions from both sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)
 that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

!Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin sitting side by side <image:3185>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day parade in Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

!Russian soldiers march in columns during a parade on Victory Day <image:3188>[View image in fullscreen](#img-5)

Russian troops who were involved in the war in Ukraine march in columns during a Victory Day parade. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war."

However, the evidence does mention the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Also, the evidence mentions that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade.

The claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is of an airliner, and the provided evidence does not support the claim that it depicts Chinese Red Cross troops. The evidence does mention the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the presence of Chinese troops in a Moscow parade. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is of an airliner, not Chinese Red Cross troops. While there is evidence of Chinese involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the Red Cross Society of China and Chinese troops marching in a Moscow parade ([https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)), the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image depicts the troops setting off for the front.

    Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine
    
    Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area – a weapon described as a giant flamethrower.
    
    That is what a Russian security official told the state-run Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially.
    
    The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.
    
    Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.
    
    Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1 Solntsepyok (“Blazing Sun”) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment.
    
    TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six miles). The TOS-2’s manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis.

    It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, handed out awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service.
    
    “You’re risking your life for all of us and our state,” he said. “Thank you for defending Ukraine’s independence. Take care!”
    
    The visit was a demonstration of the country’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas area further east.
    
    An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and destruction.
    
    Hours after the president left, loud explosions were reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces there may have subsided, but it’s not entirely gone.

    Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House
    
    Ukraine’s capital is 1,540 years old this weekend, and you’d be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasn’t in the mood to celebrate.
    
    After all, it’s just over three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some predicting it would fall within 72 hours.
    
    At the time, I remember standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry.
    
    Today it's a different scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned last week; and you can’t help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket. Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter.
    
    !Kyiv <image:1637>
    
    “Life really goes on and we do not stop,” says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. “We hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alright”.
    
    Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. “I can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it won’t be the same” she admits.
    
    “I don’t have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.”
    
    For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022.

    !Volodymyr Zelensky visits Kharkiv <image:1640>Image source, Ukraine President's Office
    
    Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight.
    
    Now, he is compared to Winston Churchill.
    
    His steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as being a crucial factor in his country’s remarkable performance in the beginning of this war.
    
    His defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical middle finger to Russia and its president.
    
    While President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long table, his officials barely in shouting distance.
    
    As effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital. Today’s visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia’s invasion.
    
    He met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
    
    The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine’s second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never have been possible.
    
    But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to retreat in the Donbas.
    
    With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.

    Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said.
    
    "'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents," he wrote in a tweet.
    
    The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added.
    
    Allowing Russia to win would "open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."
    
    Podolyak went on to say: "Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations.
    
    "Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."

7.  !Kherson pictured on 20 May <image:1643>Image source, Getty Images
    
    Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia.
    
    Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall.
    
    Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head of [Kherson's Moscow-installed administration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61338617)
    , says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed.
    
    According to Reuters news agency, he says: "We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite is planned, but it won’t be today and it won’t be tomorrow because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson region."
    
    Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide.
    
    But the UK Ministry of Defence said, [in an intelligence update in April, external](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1518335593482268672)
    , a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine.
    
    And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating "pseudo-republics" throughout the country.
    
    He has advised people [not to give the Russian authorities any personal data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61188943)
    , such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes.

8.  More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv.
    
    He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts.
    
    It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians.
    
    Here are some more pictures of his visit.

9.  Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says.
    
    Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said.
    
    "I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state," the president told troops.
    
    The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

10.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations were not at the "expected level" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance.
    
    "For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which support terrorism entering Nato," the president said.
    
    Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance.
    
    Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria.

12.  As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    
    Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 "nationalists" \[Ukrainian soldiers\] have been killed.
    
    He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro.
    
    He says: "In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."

13.  The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents.
    
    Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area.
    
    Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces.
    
    The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema.
    
    But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back.
    
    Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to "squeeze out some result for itself".

14.  Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city, state news agency Tass reports.

    [What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902)
    , we’ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
    
    All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
    
    What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
    
    Where the [horrors of Bucha](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60981238)
     are dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
    
    In other words, none of this is ever Russia’s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
    
    This is the Kremlin narrative which we’ve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we’re hearing it again now.

16.  !The BBC's Clive Myrie with Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin <image:1653>
    
    As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain has [imposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659)
    , as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.
    
    Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: "She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position.
    
    "But she's very belligerent...
    
    "On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, \[but\] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe...
    
    "But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that?
    
    "To make Russia more feeble?"
    
    The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not "toppled down" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which has [seen inflation hit a 40-year high](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175)
    , partly driven by the Ukraine war.
    
    After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered.
    
    More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.

    The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it.
    
    It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains.
    
    But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas.
    
    The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory.
    
    So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room.

18.  Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.
    
    The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.
    
    The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.
    
    "The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
    
    "The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure," she said.
    
    The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 "and is by no means a result of the special military operation" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.
    
    The pandemic "has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services", she added.

    The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the Donbas region.
    
    Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself surrounded.
    
    Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.
    
    What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine.
    
    It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next.

20.  Russia’s ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russia’s existence was threatened.
    
    The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a "fabrication".
    
    Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerous [eyewitness accounts from residents](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61003878)
    , who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.
    
    The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am.

Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops
===========================================================================================

!Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops <image:1659>

Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kiev, the presidential office says.

According to foreign media, Telegrafi reports, Zelensky visited the frontline positions in the Kharkiv region.

! <image:1660>

  

"I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our country", the president told the troops.

! <image:1661>

The northeastern city has seen some of the fiercest fighting since Russia launched its aggression in Ukraine on February 24.

! <image:1662>

His visit comes as Ukraine has begun receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and others from the US.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying that the supply of Harpoon missiles was the result of cooperation between several countries.

! <image:1663>

Ukraine has sought more sophisticated weapons, but so far most of the help has been in short-range systems, such as anti-tank weapons.

Meanwhile, the US is said to be considering a request from Ukraine to supply Kiev with heavier, longer-range weapons, but has yet to make a final decision. /**Telegraph**/

Zelensky dice que fuerzas ucranianas capturaron un centenar de soldados rusos

02:03

**(CNN) –** El presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, declaró este jueves que las fuerzas ucranianas han tomado el control de la ciudad rusa de Sudzha, más de una semana después de que sus fuerzas lanzaran una incursión en la región rusa de Kursk.

Las fuerzas de Kyiv llevan en la localidad, situada 105 kilómetros al suroeste de la ciudad de Kursk, desde el pasado miércoles, pero ésta es la primera confirmación del presidente ucraniano de que su ejército la ha capturado.

*   [En medio de la incursión en Kursk, así fue el mayor ataque de Ucrania contra aeródromos rusos desde el inicio de la guerra](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2024/08/15/ucrania-ataque-drones-aerodromos-rusos-guerra-kursk-trax/)
    

El jefe militar de Ucrania, Oleksandr Syrskyi, declaró que las tropas ucranianas han avanzado 35 kilómetros a través de las defensas rusas desde el inicio de su asalto por sorpresa, capturando 1.150 kilómetros cuadrados de territorio y 82 asentamientos.

Syrskyi dijo que se ha establecido una oficina del comandante militar en Sudzha “para mantener la ley y el orden y satisfacer las necesidades prioritarias de la población en los territorios controlados”.

Sudzha se encuentra junto a una terminal de gas rusa, punto clave para el suministro de gas de Rusia, a través de Ucrania, a Europa. Esto ha suscitado especulaciones sobre la posibilidad de que uno de los objetivos de Kyiv sea reducir una lucrativa fuente de financiación para Moscú.

La incursión terrestre ucraniana ha obligado a decenas de miles de rusos a abandonar sus hogares y ha puesto a Rusia en una situación desesperada en su lucha por repeler a las tropas de Kyiv.

El Ministerio de Defensa de Rusia afirmó haber destruido 117 aviones no tripulados y cuatro misiles tácticos sobre Kursk y las regiones vecinas.

El asalto ucraniano –[que supone una gran vergüenza para el Kremlin-](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/ukraine-incursion-russia-analysis-intl/index.html)

Las fuerzas rusas izan la bandera sobre Sudzha, la ciudad clave de Kursk

El **Ministerio de Defensa de Rusia** anunció este jueves que sus fuerzas han recuperado el control de **Sudzha**, la ciudad más grande de la región fronteriza de **Kursk**, expulsando al ejército ucraniano que ocupaba parcialmente la zona desde agosto de 2024. **La ofensiva rusa se produce en un momento clave del conflicto**, tras la propuesta de un alto el fuego de 30 días impulsada por **Estados Unidos**, la cual **Ucrania** ya ha aceptado.

El ministerio ruso afirmó en un comunicado que las unidades de la agrupación militar **Séver (Norte)** han retomado **Sudzha** junto con las localidades de **Melovói** y **Podol**, y que las operaciones continúan en la región de **Kursk** con el objetivo de eliminar las fuerzas ucranianas restantes. El ministerio ruso aseguró que continuará su ofensiva para consolidar el control de la región.

!Sudzha quedó casi destruida por <image:4618>

Sudzha quedó casi destruida por los intensos bombardeos, según Ucrania (REUTERS)

Horas antes del anuncio sobre la toma de **Sudzha**, **Putin** realizó su primera visita a **Kursk** desde el inicio de la guerra, vestido con uniforme militar y acompañado por altos mandos del ejército. Sin embargo, la reciente ofensiva rusa ha forzado una retirada de las tropas de **Kiev**, que han estado bajo una presión creciente en los últimos meses.

El comandante en jefe de **Ucrania**, **Oleksandr Syrskyi**, informó que la aviación rusa llevó a cabo un número sin precedentes de ataques en **Kursk**, lo que dejó a **Sudzha** “casi completamente destruida”. En declaraciones a la agencia ucraniana **Suspilne**, **Krasylnykov dijo que no recibió explicaciones oficiales sobre su despido, aunque insinuó que podría estar relacionado con la situación en el frente.**

El presidente **Volodimir Zelensky** ha señalado en el pasado que **Ucrania** podría utilizar **Kursk** como “moneda de cambio” en futuras negociaciones con **Rusia**. Mientras tanto, la situación en el frente sigue evolucionando, con **Moscú consolidando su control en Kursk y Washington aumentando la presión diplomática sobre el Kremlin**.

### El pontífice se expresó así durante una reunión en el Vaticano con una delegación del ‘Chagos Refugees Group’, una asociación de refugiados en las Islas Mauricio. Según el informe, las tropas rusas infligieron 340 bajas a las fuerzas de **Kiev** en las últimas 24 horas.

Como parte de la operación, **Moscú** difundió imágenes de **Sudzha** en las que se observa a soldados rusos izando la bandera nacional en el centro de la ciudad tras erradicar los últimos focos de resistencia. Durante la reunión con sus comandantes, el presidente ruso afirmó que la prioridad es “liberar completamente la región de **Kursk** del enemigo”.

**Putin también sugirió la necesidad de establecer una zona de seguridad en la frontera con Ucrania**, lo que implicaría una posible expansión de la ofensiva hacia la región ucraniana de **Sumy**. Esta idea podría complicar las negociaciones de alto el fuego, ya que ampliaría las exigencias territoriales de **Moscú**.

El jefe del Estado Mayor ruso, **Valeri Guerásimov**, informó a **Putin** que, en los últimos cinco días, las tropas rusas han tomado 24 localidades y 259 kilómetros cuadrados en **Kursk**. Según el **Kremlin**, el 86 % del territorio que estuvo bajo ocupación ucraniana ha sido recuperado.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:7>) of Volodymyr Zelensky is found in multiple sources. According to the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)), Zelensky visited troops on the front line in the Kharkiv region.

### Evidence from `web_search`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows Zelensky in Sudzha, Kursk region, in August 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The web search confirms that Sudzha was captured by Ukrainian forces in August 2024. However, the reverse image search indicates that the image was taken in the Kharkiv region in May 2022. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the location and the date.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Aim")\
\]

The objective of the meeting was to create a "[coalition of the willing](/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Russo-Ukrainian_War) "Coalition of the willing (Russo-Ukrainian War)")
" in Europe that would be able to present a peace plan for Ukraine.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Reuters-1)
 The stated [aim of the initiative](/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Russo-Ukrainian_War)#Aims "Coalition of the willing (Russo-Ukrainian War)")
 is to facilitate the [peace negotiation attempts](/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine")
 launched and mediated by the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
 between Ukraine and Russia in February 2025, by helping to build up strong enough [security guarantees](/wiki/Defense_pact "Defense pact")
 for Ukraine to ensure that a potential reached ceasefire or peace deal would be lasting.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 Besides serving the role as building up a potential peacekeeping force, the coalition have also expressed readiness to increase military support for Ukraine and strengthen economic sanctions against Russia, in the event that the ongoing negotiations for a "comprehensive ceasefire" or "peace deal" would fail. Development of a "[coalition of the willing](/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing "Coalition of the willing")
    " consisting of multiple nations prepared to defend the terms of any peace agreement and guarantee Ukraine's security afterward

### Commitments

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Commitments")\
\]

As part of the announcement, Starmer committed £1.6 billion (€1.94 billion) in [UK export finances](/wiki/UK_Export_Finance "UK Export Finance")
 to purchase more than 5,000 air defense missiles for Ukraine.[\[10\]](#cite_note-UKmissiles-10)
 The missiles will be manufactured in [Belfast](/wiki/Belfast "Belfast")
 in Northern Ireland.[\[10\]](#cite_note-UKmissiles-10)
 This complemented a previously announced £2.2 billion (€2.42 billion) loan for [military aid to Ukraine](/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War")
 backed by frozen Russian assets.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)
[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)

Starmer emphasized that European nations would need to take primary responsibility for the initiative and "do the heavy lifting"[\[10\]](#cite_note-UKmissiles-10)
 and that the agreement would require US backing and Russian involvement. In addition, he said that the role of the countries that are Russia's neighbours will be different from providing peacekeeping troops.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)

In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has demonstrated he wants to have influence in the debate on European security, which has accelerated dramatically since Washington opened discussions with Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine.

"We are at a crossroads in history," he warned on Sunday, March 2, at the [conclusion of the summit he chaired in London](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/eu-s-ursula-von-der-leyen-says-we-urgently-have-to-rearm-europe-after-ukraine-talks_6738734_4.html)
, which was attended by a dozen other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The meeting had been convened by Downing Street a week earlier, but it took on a dramatic turn following the humiliation inflicted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday.

He derided the outcome of the London meeting as "a desperate attempt to pass off as success the failure of a 10-year policy of inciting Ukraine towards Russia by the same Great Britain and, until recently, the United States".

"Europe has no plan," wrote Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia's upper house of parliament.

"And if Ukraine should count on something, it can only be on progress (if there is any to come) in Russian-American relations."

He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hosted the meeting, "cannot fail to understand this".

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025, in London. The summit was organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to create a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit's outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including financial aid and the purchase of air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit was attended by leaders including Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The sources include articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine)), Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/)). <image:9>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, and the presence of leaders like Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky. However, the provided sources do not mention anything about the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim that the image depicts an authentic moment of world leaders taking off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the authenticity of the image and the context of the leaders removing their suits.

The image search results show leaders in suits, but no images of them taking off their suits. This further casts doubt on the claim. The evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that the leaders took off their suits.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the leaders removing their suits.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025, in London. The summit was organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to create a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit's outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including financial aid and the purchase of air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit was attended by leaders including Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The sources include articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine)), Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/)). <image:9>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, and the presence of leaders like Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky. However, the provided sources do not mention anything about the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim that the image depicts an authentic moment of world leaders taking off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the authenticity of the image and the context of the leaders removing their suits.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources contain images of leaders, including Zelenskyy, Macron, and others, in suits. One image is from NBC News (<image:4638>

## Elaboration
The image search results show leaders in suits, but no images of them taking off their suits. This further casts doubt on the claim. The evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that the leaders took off their suits.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the leaders removing their suits.

How criticism of Zelensky's clothing made it to the Oval Office

Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump

It was the first thing President Donald Trump said when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky stepped out of his car at the White House on Friday.

"You're all dressed up today," Trump said as he greeted him, referring to Zelensky's military-style black sweatshirt, adorned with the Ukrainian trident.

Zelensky has eschewed suits, button-down shirts and ties - even during important meetings with world leaders and an address to the US Congress - since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of his country began in 2022.

The Ukrainian leader has said his choice of clothing is a show of solidarity with soldiers fighting the Russian army on the war's frontlines.

But it has long been an irritant for some critics of US aid to Ukraine, and after years as a talking point in right-wing media circles, the issue came to global attention in a spectacular way during Friday's now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance.

A question to Zelensky from a reporter accused him of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit and this immediately changed the atmosphere in the room, according to BBC reporters present.

And a short time later, larger issues of respect and gratitude fuelled the extraordinary argument that saw the US president and vice-president upbraid their European ally in front of the world's TV cameras.

*   [Zelensky wants US to 'stand more firmly' on Ukraine's side](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgeqr0vg0no)
    

When the meeting was opened up to questions from reporters, one came from Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for conservative cable network Real America's Voice.

"Why don't you wear a suit?" Glenn asked. The BBC contacted the network for comment.

After the Oval Office spat, Glenn posted online that he had "extreme empathy for the people of Ukraine" but said that Zelensky's lack of a suit demonstrated "his inner disrespect" for the US.

Zelensky's defenders online posted pictures of Winston Churchill wearing casual clothes during World War Two.

Pictures from the period show the British leader wearing jumpsuit-like clothes to a meeting with then-US President Franklin Roosevelt, and he also wore military uniforms and suits during conflabs with world leaders.

! US news outlet Axios reported that before the meeting, White House staffers had requested that Zelensky wear a suit and were offended when he did not.

However, the two world leaders continued taking questions, more or less cordially, for nearly another 20 minutes before the extraordinary argument broke out, after an interruption by the US vice-president, JD Vance.

Vance repeatedly brought up "respect" – referring to Zelensky as "Mr President" as the Ukrainian leader called him "JD" – and said: "I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media right now".

The discussion went downhill from there. "You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit.

"Do you own a suit?" he continued. "A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office."

The aggressive questioning marked the moment when the Ukrainian president – who until then seemed to be having a diplomatic, even friendly, conversation with Trump – first appeared tired and irritated.

"I will wear costume after this war will finish," Zelensky replied. "Maybe something cheaper."

Watch: Key moments in Oval Office, including reporter's dig at Zelensky's outfit

Glenn's question gave voice to a longstanding gripe in the world of Make America Great Again (Maga) politics, where some - like JD Vance - argue that the Ukrainian leader does not seem to be showing enough gratitude or respect to the US for three years of military aid.

A former local TV reporter in Dallas who became better known in conservative circles for his work at another pro-Trump channel, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Glenn is an unabashed Trump fan. Last year [he told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/24/brian-glenn-marjorie-taylor-greene-00153452)
 that he was "100 percent behind President Trump and the America First agenda."

He is also reportedly dating Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who is one of Trump's most outspoken supporters.

Glenn was in the room as part of the White House press pool, a group of reporters which covers the president at official events on behalf of the wider media.

The [Trump administration took control of the pool](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce30n52e6p1o)

Churchill wore a one-piece suit - which he called a 'siren suit' after the warning horns which signalled a German air raid - to the White House in the midst of the Second World War

After Glenn's question, the news conference swiftly moved on, to a query about whether the US would send more arms to Ukraine. A suit-less Zelensky was soon ejected from the White House, as relations between the two countries reached a new wartime low.

European leaders scrambled to shield Ukraine in high-stakes Trump talks – but did they?
=======================================================================================

The shifting loyalties of the White House have inadvertently bound Europe closer together – how long can that unity last?

It was [dubbed](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1mtx07r/the_great_european_charm_offensive_europes_most/)
 the “Great European Charm Offensive”.

Hours before Volodymyr Zelenskyy [headed to Washington](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/17/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-alaska-anchorage-summit-ukraine)
 for a Monday meeting with Donald Trump, announcements came pouring in from across Europe, making it clear that the president of Ukraine [would not](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/zelenskyy-faces-daunting-trip-to-the-white-house-but-this-time-he-wont-be-alone)
 be going alone.

Instead, seven European heavyweights – a [“dream team”](https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/aug/18/can-europe-leaders-drag-trump-ukraine-policy-back-on-track-zelenskyy-today-in-focus-extra-podcast)
 of leaders [representing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/volodymyr-zelenskyy-european-leaders-ukraine-talks-donald-trump-washington)
 Europe’s economic and military heft and who had a proven rapport with the US president – hastily cleared their schedules to join Zelenskyy in Washington. But the “rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force” was also about protecting Ukraine and Europe from any widening aggression from Moscow, [said Luke Harding](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/monday-briefing-whats-at-stake-for-ukrainians-as-trump-and-putin-talk-of-ceding-land-in-return-for-peace)
, the Guardian’s senior international correspondent, as the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Finland landed in Washington alongside their EU and Nato counterparts.

The talks offered up a showcase of the lessons learned during Trump’s erratic time in power. As Pjotr Sauer, a Guardian Russian affairs reporter, [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)
, some fear Trump may have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to compromise.

[skip past newsletter promotion](#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)

after newsletter promotion

Others, such as Yuriy Boyechko, CEO of charity Hope for Ukraine, suggested Trump is deliberately setting out an exit path for Washington by entertaining Putin’s [demands that Ukraine withdraws](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/ukraine-frontline-troops-drones-dobropillia)
 from Donetsk and Luhansk, even as Zelenskyy sets a firm red line against ceding land beyond the present occupation or legitimising Moscow’s control.

Putin had offered a “peace deal” that Ukraine would be forced to reject, knowing Trump would then blame Zelenskyy and end US support for Kyiv, [he told the Guardian on Monday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/trump-ukraine-crimea-nato-zelesnkyy-washington-meeting)
.

After a week dominated by talks and [punctuated](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-airstrike-casulaties-kharkiv-donetsk-zaporizhzhya-kherson-poltava-chernihiv/33507183.html)
 by Russian bombs continuing to rain down on Ukraine, Boyechko hoped that the jarring contrast would force European leaders to realise that it would take more than just charm offensives to protect the region. The result was a meeting set to become among the “oddest in modern diplomacy”, Simon McDonald, former permanent under secretary at the Foreign Office, [wrote in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/washington-summit-ukraine-donald-trump-europe-russia)
.

Their scramble hinted at just how much was at stake. Six months after Zelenskyy’s [extraordinary dressing down](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-shouting-match-oval-office)
 in the Oval Office, the Ukrainian president peppered his opening remarks with eight thank you’s, most of them directed at Trump, as he sported what one European diplomat described as “almost a suit” in a style that Reuters [coined](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/takeaways-well-mannered-white-house-welcome-ukraine-leaves-many-questions-2025-08-18/)
 as “combat formal”.

Matthias Matthijs, a senior fellow for Europe at the Council of Foreign Relations, likened it to the meandering trajectory that EU trade relations have taken under Trump: “There are always high expectations, and then the Europeans’ expectations are dashed by the Americans – usually by Trump’s social media posts or some interview he gives,” [he said following Monday’s meeting](https://www.cfr.org/article/major-takeaways-trumps-meeting-zelenskyy-and-european-leaders?utm_source=announcement-202508ukraine&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=UkrainePromo2025Aug18&utm_term=Announcement_20250818Ukraine)

----------- As Trump publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire and insisted it was now up to Zelenskyy to “get it done,” [the mood in Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/16/russia-jubilant-putin-alaska-summit-trump-ukraine)
 was jubilant.

At its most simple, the united European front was aimed at avoiding a repeat of Trump’s February ambush of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. On Monday, Trump and several European leaders, said Putin [had agreed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy in the coming weeks.

Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any such meeting – which would be the first since Russia launched its full invasion of [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 more than three years ago – is being planned, with a Kremlin aide saying only that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising the level of representatives” in the Ukraine talks.

Trump had also indicated a willingness to be part of [security guarantees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/what-security-guarantees-might-ukraine-get-in-return-for-a-peace-deal)
 for Kyiv if there was a deal to end fighting. But the exact nature of those guarantees remains to be seen, with Trump [later ruling out](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)
 the possibility of the US putting troops on the ground in Ukraine and instead floating that Washington could provide air support.

Concerns also continue to linger over what exactly Trump proposed in Alaska and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the near three-hour meeting."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025, in London. The summit was organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to create a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit's outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including financial aid and the purchase of air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit was attended by leaders including Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The sources include articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine)), Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/)). <image:9>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, and the presence of leaders like Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky. However, the provided sources do not mention anything about the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim that the image depicts an authentic moment of world leaders taking off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the authenticity of the image and the context of the leaders removing their suits.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`

## Elaboration
The image search results show leaders in suits, but no images of them taking off their suits. This further casts doubt on the claim. The evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that the leaders took off their suits.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the leaders removing their suits.

​​​​​​​**LONDON**

The Italian Prime Minister said Tuesday she understands the US approval of the use of long-range missiles for Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice, according to Italian news agency, ANSA.

Giorgia Meloni told reporters at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that the US decision was a "response" to Russia's war against Ukraine.

She said, however, that Italy pledges "support" for Ukraine as long as there is a war there.

US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response that the use of Western missiles by Ukraine may be considered an attack by a non-nuclear state with nuclear support, potentially justifying Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

Moscow has revised its nuclear doctrine, reducing the barriers to deploying nuclear weapons in a conflict. 

"We have always been focused on the issue of anti-aircraft defense," said Meloni. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The world is becoming increasingly interconnected. Shared challenges require shared solutions.

The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today concluded his participation at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he worked with other leaders to solve pressing global challenges while securing security and stability for Canada. Canada will also play a key role in the **Global Clean Power Alliance**, a United Kingdom-led initiative aiming to boost global investment in clean energy and help countries move away from fossil fuels.

Throughout the Summit, the Prime Minister participated in various G20 working sessions where he advanced progress on global peace and security, with a focus on Ukraine and the Middle East. He condemned Russia’s unjustifiable full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which marked 1,000 days on November 19, 2024, and reiterated Canada’s steadfast support for the Ukrainian government and people. Finally, the Prime Minister endorsed a [Leaders’ Declaration](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/g20/2024-11-18-g20-rio-declaration.aspx?lang=eng)
 reaffirming Canada’s commitment to work with its G20 partners to make life better for people around the world.

The Prime Minister stressed that our shared challenges will have a direct impact on people worldwide, especially on workers, working families, and young people. G20 members are the world’s major economies and represent all inhabited continents, with 80 per cent of the world GDP, 75 per cent of global trade, and 60 per cent of the world’s population.
*   The G20 includes the African Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

President Joe Biden arrives late for the group photo during the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Monday, Nov. He missed it, along with Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Canada's Justin Trudeau, the current and next leaders of the G7 group.

Any commitments Biden makes at the G20 may be overturned by the next White House administration. President-elect Donald Trump.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva welcomed foreign leaders to Rio de Janeiro’s modern art museum Monday morning and delivered an opening address that focused on fighting food insecurity.

“It is for those of us here, around this table, to face the undelayable task of ending this stain that shames humanity,” Lula told his colleagues. “That will be our biggest legacy.”

Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa expresses fear and distaste at how Trump treats Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

After Friday's contentious meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the White House was sent a letter. His letter was signed by dozens of other former Polish political prisoners.

ANDRZEJ BOBINKSI: Nobody wants to say anything too vivid, too aggressive towards, you know, Donald Trump and the United States. And I think that, you know, by the end of Donald Trump's term, Poland will be in a very different place.

SCHMITZ: And Walesa's scathing letter, says Bobinski, is a sign of Poland turning away from its longtime friend. As NPR's Central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz reports, the letter expressed to the Trump administration what the Polish government cannot.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: The letter begins with your excellency Mr. and its historical antipathy towards Russia.

BOBINKSI: Donald Trump is way too lenient and way too friendly towards Vladimir Putin. And I don't think anybody has come out outright and said that we don't want to be friends with the United States anymore.

SCHMITZ: Certainly not Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, who made this statement after the Oval Office incident.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK: (Speaking Polish).

SCHMITZ: "I know a narrative is being created, especially after that very strange Friday at the White House," said Tusk, "that would divide Europe and the United States. It goes on to compare Trump and Vance's treatment of Zelenskyy to interrogations by political police under communist Poland, and it demands more respect for a leader whose soldiers are shedding blood to defend the free world. We do not understand, the letter says, how the leader of a country that is a symbol of the free world cannot see that. The author is Lech Walesa, former leader of Poland's Solidarity movement, the first Democratically elected president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his leadership in opposing communist rule. "We cannot allow that to happen," he said."

WARSAW — Poland’s democracy hero Lech Walesa and dozens of other former political prisoners in Poland have written a letter to President Trump, telling him that his treatment of Ukraine’s president at the Oval Office last week filled them “with horror and distaste.”

Walesa, who served as president soon after Poland embraced democracy, and the others tell Trump that they found it offensive that he expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show respect and gratitude for the materiel assistance the United States has given Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

"I'm going to make a decision as to what we do and it's going to be, it's going to be a very important decision, and that's whether or not it's massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it's your fight," Trump said.

He said he was unhappy about Russia's [strike](/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-says-overnight-strikes-lay-bare-russias-intentions-war-2025-08-21/)
 on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured some of the facility's employees.

"I'm not happy about it, and I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, said on Friday that Russia was doing everything it could to prevent a meeting between him and Putin, while Russia's foreign minister said the agenda for such a meeting was not ready.

Zelenskiy has repeatedly called for Putin to meet him, saying it is the only way to negotiate an end to the war.

Trump had said he had begun the arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskiy meeting after a call with the Russian leader on Monday that followed their Alaska meeting on August 15.

Zelenskiy accused Russia of stalling.

"The meeting is one of the components of how to end the war," he said on Friday at a press conference in Kyiv with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. He said the guarantees ought to be similar to [NATO's Article 5](/world/europe/rutte-says-article-5-type-deal-considered-ukraine-nato-membership-not-discussed-2025-08-19/)
, which considers an attack on one member of the alliance as an attack against all.

Rutte said NATO allies and Ukraine are working together to ensure security guarantees are strong enough that Russia will never try to attack again.

"Robust security guarantees will be essential, and this is what we are now working on to define," he said.

(This story has been corrected to show that the strike on the factory was not deadly, it only involved injuries, and to clarify that it was an American factory, in paragraph 3)

Trump's comments did not address the fact that Russia was banned from international competitions such as the World Cup after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and has not taken part in qualification for the 2026 tournament, which will be hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

During a visit to a nuclear research center on Friday, Putin said Trump's leadership qualities would help restore U.S.-Russia relations.

"With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska," Putin said.

Proposed Ukraine land concessions are Putin's trap, EU's top diplomat tells BBC

Watch: "Russia hasn't made one single concession", Kaja Kallas says

The top diplomat of the European Union (EU) has warned against pushing Ukraine to give up territories to Russia as part of a future peace deal.

Speaking in her first UK interview since EU leaders joined Donald Trump's White House peace talks with Ukraine, Kaja Kallas told the BBC's Today programme that letting Russia keep Ukrainian territories was a "trap that Putin wants us to walk into".

The Donbas region in eastern Ukraine has long been contested by Russia, with military aggression [forcing 1.5 million Ukrainians to flee](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgv1pdkll8o)
 over the past decade.

Ukraine has consistently rejected conceding Donbas to the Kremlin in exchange for peace, though Trump stressed the need for "swapping of territories".

Kallas - who has been placed on the Kremlin's "wanted list" - also spoke at length about "credible and robust" security guarantees for Ukraine.

She admitted that there were not many "concrete steps" for a deterring force at this stage in negotiations.

"The strongest security guarantee is a strong Ukraine army," she said, outlining the importance of establishing guarantees that were "not just on paper".

She said it was up to member states of the ["coalition of the willing"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo)
 to determine exactly what they could contribute, and that it was not yet clear in what capacity those forces would operate.

Leaders from key EU countries, including France, Germany, Italy and Finland, joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for talks at the White House last week, days after Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in a military base in Alaska.

[Kremlin plays down Zelensky talks as Trump warns Putin may not want to make deal\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn92e52rpjxo)

[Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia\
---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o)

On the Alaska summit, Kallas said that Putin got "everything he wanted" and that would impact his interest in negotiating a peace deal.

"He got such a welcoming and he wanted sanctions not to be put in place, which he also achieved.

"Putin is just laughing, not stopping the killing but increasing the killing," Kallas said. They don't want to end this war."

He also put pressure on Western allies, saying Ukraine would like to "have an understanding of the security guarantees architecture within seven to 10 days".

"We need to understand which country will be ready to do what at each specific moment," he added.

Zelensky has criticised the significant air attack by Russia early on Thursday, saying it was behaving as if there were no global efforts to stop the war.

Eleven different locations in Ukraine were hit, killing at least one and injuring more than a dozen in the western city of Lviv close to the Polish border.

A number of European leaders earlier echoed EU and Ukrainian views about Putin's unwillingness to engage with a peace deal.

Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Putin was "rarely to be trusted", and that he was sceptical about Putin eventually agreeing to a bilateral meeting with Zelensky.

French President Emmanuel Macron called the Russian leader "a predator, and an ogre at our doorstep" and expressed "the greatest doubt" that he would be willing to work towards peace.

Both leaders were in attendance at White House peace talks on Monday.

Zelensky has said he is willing to meet Putin "in any format", but [told reporters on Thursday that there was still no sign from Moscow that they "truly intend to engage in substantive negotiations".](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62wj8yje2eo)

* * * "We are forgetting that Russia has not made one single concession."

She added that the EU had put together the 19th package of sanctions to pressure the Russian leader into further discussions.

Meanwhile, Trump on Thursday set a two-week time frame for evaluating peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.

"I would say within two weeks we're going to know one way or the other," he said in a telephone interview with Todd Starnes, a host for right-wing media outlet Newsmax.

"After that, we'll have to maybe take a different tack," Trump said.

But Zelensky cast doubt on Putin showing willingness for a meeting with him.

In comments released to reporters on Thursday, reported by the Agence France-Presse news agency, Zelensky accused Russia of avoiding the "necessity" of holding a meeting between the two countries' leaders.

"Current signals from Russia are, to be honest, indecent."

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Ukraine is 'not interested in a sustainable, fair, long-term settlement' \[Alexander Zemlianichenko/Reuters\]

Published On 21 Aug 202521 Aug 2025

Russia has said that Ukraine was “not interested” in a long-term peace deal, accusing it of seeking security guarantees incompatible with Russia’s demands.

“The Ukrainian regime and its representatives comment on the current situation in a very specific way, directly showing that they are not interested in a sustainable, fair, long-term settlement,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference on Thursday.

Lavrov also repeated Russia’s policy that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to meet with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy – but only after key issues have previously been worked out by senior officials in what could be a long negotiating process.

His comments came as Zelenskyy announced he could meet with Putin, but only after his allies agree to security guarantees for Ukraine to deter future Russian attacks once the fighting stops.

In comments released on Thursday, Zelenskyy also warned that both sides were preparing for further fighting. Russia was building up troops on the southern front line and Ukraine was test-launching a new long-range cruise missile, he said.

US President Donald Trump is trying to end Russia’s three-and-a-half-year invasion of Ukraine through talks with Zelenskyy and Putin.

While he has upended a years-long Western policy of isolating the Russian leader, he has made little tangible progress towards a peace deal.

Trump said in comments posted on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that the war would have “never happened” if he was in office at the time of Russia’s invasion.

“Zero chance,” Trump wrote, adding: “Interesting times ahead,” without elaborating further.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January and began pushing for an end to the fighting, Russian forces have continued to slowly but steadily [gain ground](/news/2025/8/19/ukraine-hit-by-multiple-russian-strikes-amid-us-led-push-for-end-to-war)
 across the front line.

Zelenskyy, in his comments to reporters, said Ukraine wants to have “an understanding of the security guarantees architecture within seven to 10 days”.

“We need to understand which country will be ready to do what at each specific moment,” he added.

Ukraine allies led by the United Kingdom and France are putting together a military coalition to support the guarantees. Lavrov warned that any deployment of European troops to the country would be “absolutely unacceptable”.

Once an outline of the security guarantees is agreed, Trump would like to see a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian leader said.

But any meeting with the Russian leader should be held in a “neutral” European country, he added, ruling out any summit in Moscow.

He also rejected the idea of China playing a role in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security, citing Beijing’s alleged support for Moscow.

Zelenskyy has said the only way to end the war is a meeting with Putin, and has said Trump should be present, too.

But Moscow has played down the prospect of a summit between Putin and Zelenskyy any time soon, insisting it needs to be [included in discussions](/news/2025/8/20/russia-says-ukraine-security-guarantees-talks-must-include-moscow)

WATCH: Harris meets with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy as Russia makes nuclear warning
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Sep 26, 2024 6:51 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — With American support for Ukraine at a partisan crossroads, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday slammed suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory for the sake of peace with Moscow as “dangerous and unacceptable.”

The Democratic presidential nominee spoke alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as she unleashed the veiled criticism of Republican candidate Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war.

“They are not proposals for peace,” Harris said. “Where Trump goes off course, and where Biden and Harris have a much stronger argument, is that we get to that point not by throwing Ukraine under the bus but by giving them sufficient support so they can block further Russian aggression.”

 [Chris Megerian, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/chris-megerian-associated-press) assistance for Ukraine, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and faulted Zelenskyy for the ongoing bloodshed.

[**WATCH:** Trump suggests Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russian invasion during N.C. He rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on.”

Asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” and “we need peace.”

Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian leader asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.”

The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications, however benign their contents, was a reminder of the tension that’s been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy.

It was a far different impression than Harris delivered on Thursday as she embraced Ukraine’s defense and outlined a broader foreign policy vision rooted in “international order, rules and norms.” Harris rejected calls for the U.S. to walk away from its global role and warned that potential aggressors could be emboldened if Putin emerges victorious.

“The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it’s in our strategic interest,” Harris said.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to present the White House and Congress with his plans for reaching an endgame in the war by improving Ukraine’s chances on the battlefield and its eventual leverage at the negotiating table. has a responsibility to help Ukraine, compared with one third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in July.

Americans are also split on which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the war. [An AP-NORC poll from August](https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP-NORC-August-2024-President-Topline.pdf)
 found that about one-third of Americans said they trusted Harris more, while a similar share said the same about Trump.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy found some bipartisan support as he visited Capitol Hill, where he was greeted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sen. Jim Himes, another Connecticut Democrat and the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Zelenskyy wanted “more, faster.”

“He was politely frustrated,” Himes said, and specifically requested more Patriot missile defenses as Russia escalates strikes on Ukraine’s cities and energy grid before the winter.

Zelenskyy faces a much more tense situation with Trump. However, he said, Trump risks undermining Ukraine by enabling Putin to make more gains on the battlefield.

“Neither Ukraine nor Russia is going to win this war, and the sooner that the parties try to end this, the better,” Kupchan said. He’s pushing to lift restrictions on using long-range Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russian territory.

No movement on this issue was evident during Zelenskyy’s visit."

Ukraine and its war with Russia have become a central and controversial topic in the 2024 U.S. During the presidential debate with Harris in September, Trump declined to reveal whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia when he was asked, instead responding, “I want the war to stop,” and urging the two countries to negotiate a deal.

“What I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other, I’ll get them together,” Trump [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-russia-ukraine-2024/)
. Trump and Zelenskyy had a phone call in July, which the former president described as a “very good phone call.” He [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-friday-2024-07-19/)
 in a social media post after that call that when he is president, Ukraine and Russia “will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.” He has suggested that lifting the sanctions against Russia will be part of this deal.

Trump has criticized the Biden administration for sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. A Harris administration might well continue Biden’s policy of providing Ukraine with enough support so that it does not lose, but not with the wherewithal to win and eject Russia from Ukrainian territory.

**What is the outlook?**
------------------------

On the face of it, it appears that a future Harris administration’s policy toward Russia and Ukraine would represent continuity with that of the Biden administration. The brutal conflict, in which a [million people](https://www.wsj.com/world/one-million-are-now-dead-or-injured-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-b09d04e5)
 have been killed or severely injured, shows no signs of ending. President Joe Biden has said that [Ukraine must prevail](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-putin-will-not-prevail-war-with-ukraine-2024-09-13/)
 in this war and that Russia will not win. Donald Trump, who claims the war would not have broken out had he been president in 2022, says he [could end it 24 hours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893)
 after being elected, before his inauguration.

The issue for the American voter is whether the United States should continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes (as the White House now says) or whether it should pressure Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and end the war without having regained its full territorial integrity. national interest to pour so much money into supporting Ukraine and favor a rapid end to the conflict.

**Trump’s policies toward Russia and Ukraine during his presidency**

Both Russia and Ukraine featured prominently during Trump’s first presidency, as I have [written](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chaos-reconsidered/9780231556262)
 elsewhere."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia. The IMDb.com source ([https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)) provides a quote by Harris that includes the following: "Ukraine is a country in Europe. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country."

The claim includes the same statements, but it also adds, "So basically that's wrong." The evidence does not include this part of the statement.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate.

Після цього канал ще близько пів години транслював Великодню службу з Москви за участю глави Російської Православної Церкви патріарха Кіріла.

В **Міністерстві закордонних справ України** заявили, що телеканал має попросити вибачення за свою помилку та провести розслідування.

> "Якщо це була помилка, а не свідома політична заява, слід вибачитися та розслідувати, хто зробив помилку", — заявив речник МЗС Георгій Тихий.

Oroszország neve szerepelt Kijevé mellett az amerikai Fox News csatorna adásában, amelyben a különböző országok húsvéti ünnepségeit mutatták be, [írja](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/20/7508362/)
 az Ukrajinszka Pravda. Többek között az orosz ortodox egyház ceremóniáját is bemutatták, amelyen Vlagyimir Putyin elnök is részt vett, majd nem sokkal később az ukránoké következett.

„Kijev, Ukrajna” – állt a felirat felvétel mellett, majd Ukrajnát egyszer csak kicserélték Oroszországra, amit aztán hosszabb ideig mutattak a képernyőn. Végül azért visszacsatolták Ukrajna fővárosát Ukrajnához.

Mindez jelentős felháborodást keltett az orosz agresszió áldozatául esett ország nyilvánosságában.

Fox news

Američka televizijska mreža **Fox News**, poznata po svojoj **pro-republikanskoj orijentaciji**, izazvala je val kritika i ogorčenja nakon što je na Uskrs emitirala **višeminutni prijenos pravoslavne mise** iz Rusije, na kojoj su prikazani **Vladimir Putin** i **patrijarh Kiril Gundjajev**. Tijekom više od **30 minuta emitiranja**, voditelji su Kijev nazvali “**ruskim gradom**“, što je izazvalo val negativnih reakcija u **Ukrajini**, ali i u **Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama**.

* * *

### **Kritike: “Legitimiziranje zločinaca” i “pranje imidža”**

Emitiranje mise s Putinom u prvom planu i patrijarhom Kirilom, koji je **otvoreno podržavao rusku agresiju na Ukrajinu**, mnogi su gledatelji i analitičari okarakterizirali kao **“legitimizaciju ubojica”**. Na društvenim mrežama zaredale su optužbe da **Fox News pokušava prikazati Putina kao uzornog kršćanina**, unatoč njegovim **neispunjenim obećanjima o uskrsnom primirju**, dok se u isto vrijeme nastavljaju **ruski napadi na ukrajinske gradove**.

* * *

### **Dvostruka mjerila i politička poruka?**

Komentatori su upozorili na **hipokriziju u pristupu**, budući da je televizijska kuća odlučila prikazivati **vjerski događaj** u režiji autokratskog režima, istovremeno **zanemarujući agresiju**, **civilne žrtve** i **ratna razaranja** koje taj isti režim provodi. Posebno je problematična izjava voditelja koji je **Kijev, [glavni grad](https://www.rijekadanas.com/pesut-na-skupstini-liste-za-rijeku-nas-glavni-grad-je-rijeka/)
 Ukrajine, nazvao ruskim gradom** – što je stav u potpunosti suprotan međunarodnom pravu i stajalištima većine zapadnih zemalja.

* * *

### **Reakcije iz Ukrajine**

Ukrajinski korisnici društvenih mreža, novinari i diplomati izrazili su **ogorčenje zbog emitiranja sadržaja koji potiče rusku propagandu**. Mnogi su podsjetili da patrijarh Kiril od početka rata **otvoreno blagoslivlja vojne operacije**, a da sam **Putin koristi vjerske događaje** kako bi prikrio političke i vojne ciljeve.

"Live Now made an unintentional mistake Saturday evening during extensive live coverage of Easter services from around the world," a spokesperson said in response to a _Newsweek_ comment request. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. ET) on Saturday and midnight into Monday morning as part of an Easter truce resting on "humanitarian" concerns.

The announcement [was quickly met with skepticism from Kyiv officials](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-easter-truce-russia-ukraine-backlash-2061857)
 and Western analysts.

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

"As of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 said in a statement early on Sunday.

The declared truce came a day after Secretary of State [Marco Rubio](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/marco-rubio)

However, after a break in the broadcast, Fox News resumed the coverage with a caption that read: “Easter service: Kyiv, Russia.”

Earlier, we [reported](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/holy-war-russian-orthodox-church-offers-kremlin-1711782718.html)

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

Conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/alex-jones)
 is claiming that "[murdered" Infowars colleague Jamie White](https://www.newsweek.com/jamie-white-infowars-reporter-killed-austin-texas-says-alex-jones-2042621)
 was on a Ukrainian "hit list."

[Austin Police have said](https://www.austintexas.gov/news/homicide-investigation-2336-douglas-street?fbclid=IwY2xjawI-PBRleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbMtDECuTDyBq1bLIM3ZSmAZvk88pimhdAaIEoHrB6VbtafhunanOqMUKA_aem_cnk7753kkpdvbmz-1ETvEw)
 White—shot and killed in his apartment's parking lot close to midnight on Sunday, March 9—likely died from a car robbery gone wrong.

The Travis County District Attorney's office and Infowars have been contacted for comment via email.

!Alex Jones courthouse 2024 <image:2102>

Alex Jones speaks to the media after arriving at the federal courthouse for a hearing in front of a bankruptcy judge, June 14, 2024, in Houston. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle, when he interrupted them," said the police statement.

In June 2024, White posted to X, formerly Twitter: "I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at Infowars and with Alex Jones on the Ukraine proxy war The group who compiled this list is tied to the U.S. State Dept, USAID, [CIA](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cia)
 and George Soros"

He included a screenshot of his name and his social media handles on a website, but did not provide a link to the website, the name of the website, or any identifying details about what this so-called 'hit list' was, who wrote it, and where it came from.

White was [likely referring the open-sourced database of persons deemed to have promoted anti-Ukrainian narratives](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-tucker-carlson-ukraine-kill-list-over-putin-interview-1868211)
 or acted to destabilize Ukraine's national security created by the Ukranian NGO "Center for Research of Elements of Crimes against the National Security of Ukraine, Peace, Humanity, and the International Law."

This list is not a "kill list" or a "hit list," and is created by an independent nonprofit which receives no state funding.

Jones is perhaps best [known for lying about the Sandy Hook shooting](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-bankrupt-infowars-sandy-hook-liquidation-1909459)
 and having to pay $1.5 billion to the victims' families for his false claims.

In this case, he has stopped short of blaming Ukraine outright for White's death, but has made several videos and interview appearances in which he stressed that White was on a Ukrainian 'hit list' for investigating the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and [George Soros](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/george-soros)
.

At the end of an X video on the death of his colleague, Jones also tries to sell coins and supplements which are on his website.

> I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at [@infowars](https://twitter.com/infowars?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

, and gave the site back to Jones.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**Alex Jones**: "The murder of anyone is terrible, but the murder of a journalist is always extremely suspicious especially when the Ukrainian government had put him on a hit list for simply stating facts that they were stealing a lot of taxpayer money."

**District Attorney Garza told the _Austin American Statesman_**: "Our hearts go out to the family of Jamie White. Languages: English.

Why It Matters
--------------

The death of White, 36, has attracted widespread attention, both because of his association with [Infowars](https://www.newsweek.com/jamie-white-infowars-reporter-killed-austin-texas-says-alex-jones-2042621)
, and claims by its influential founder Jones that the killing was a politically motivated murder. State Dept, USAID, CIA and George Soros [pic.twitter.com/QMa75oxgMW](https://t.co/QMa75oxgMW)
> 
> — Jamie White (@whiteisthefury) [June 12, 2024](https://twitter.com/whiteisthefury/status/1800946048753422402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Jones claimed in a six-minute video that White was doing research for years into USAID and George Soros.

He said: "We're not saying that they did it. Despite officials stating there is no evidence to support such claims, the case has nonetheless fueled speculation among Jones' supporters who buy into his conspiracy theories.

What To Know
------------

At approximately 11:56 p.m, officers "responded to the call of a shooting at the Chandelier Apartments located at 2336 Douglas Street," according to [a statement](https://www.austintexas.gov/news/homicide-investigation-2336-douglas-street?fbclid=IwY2xjawI-PBRleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbMtDECuTDyBq1bLIM3ZSmAZvk88pimhdAaIEoHrB6VbtafhunanOqMUKA_aem_cnk7753kkpdvbmz-1ETvEw)
 by the Austin Police Department (APD).

They discovered White lying on the ground of the parking lot, with apparent trauma to his body. The initial investigation shows that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of the apartment complex in which he lived. But since they did put him on a hit list, have a spokesperson say they would come after him and [Elon Musk](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elon-musk)
 and Senator Hawley … you have to say it might not just have just been gangbangers \[sic.\]."

Content: "There is no evidence that Jamie White was on any “list of enemies of Ukraine” – and it is doubtful that such a list even exists.

! His sister and local police believe that his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities.**

[Pro-Russian sources](https://archive.ph/MWRtT)
 have spread manipulative headlines claiming that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was allegedly murdered shortly after Ukraine added him to its kill list. Ultra-right-wing and conspiracy-minded InfoWars journalist Jamie White was indeed murdered in Austin on the evening of March 9, on his way home from work. However, White frequently spread disinformation and anti-Ukrainian conspiracy theories, including claims about American bio-labs in Ukraine and that the Maidan protests were orchestrated by Barack Obama’s administration.

! Moreover, the screenshot White posted of the alleged “list” does not match the actual appearance of the Myrotvorets website. <image:2108>

Screenshot – X

Moreover, the journalist’s sister, Kelly Neal, does not believe White was deliberately targeted. He was shot by a person or persons trying to break into his car for the second time_,” [she told The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)
. And in June 2024, he [claimed](https://archive.ph/R7Dq4)
 on his X account that he had been added to a “list of enemies of Ukraine” but he provided no links or evidence that this list existed. Russian propagandists assumed he was referring to Myrotvorets, but White’s name does not appear in that database. Law enforcement officials [share that view](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html)
: police said White caught the perpetrators trying to steal his car, at which point he was shot."

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump \[AFP\]

By Jeff Cercone | PolitiFact

Published On 21 Feb 202521 Feb 2025

United States President Donald Trump has made a series of claims about Ukraine and its leader as he seeks to [end](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 the country’s three-year war with Russia.

Trump’s relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soured publicly as Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and said he “started” the war with Russia, a claim PolitiFact rated [pants-on-fire false](/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims)
. A search of Google and the Nexis news database found no reports of polls showing Zelenskyy with a 4 percent approval rating.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted February 4-9, Zelenskyy had a trust rating of 57 percent among 1,000 Ukrainians surveyed. Trump’s figure nearly doubles the amount that Congress has appropriated or made available since the war began.

Ukraine Oversight – the website of the special inspector general for Operation Atlantic Resolve, which the US government created in 2014 to coordinate its military aid to Ukraine – said that as of September 30, the US had spent $183bn to help Ukraine.

Mark Cancian, a senior defence and security adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the amount the US has spent varies depending on what is being counted as “aid to Ukraine” but most estimates are in the range of $175bn to $185bn.

“No matter what you add, however, the total doesn’t get close to $350bn,” Cancian said.

The numbers cited by Trump in terms of aid to Ukraine contradict data from the US government itself. The war of words has escalated after Zelenskyy accused Trump of repeating [Russian misinformation](/news/2025/2/20/trump-vs-zelenskyy-whats-behind-escalating-war-of-words)

Trump, who sent a team to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin negotiations on ending the war that did not include Ukraine, described Zelenskyy as a “modestly successful comedian” who was only good at playing former US President Joe Biden “like a fiddle”.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. “To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.”

Putin’s false rationalisations for the war were named PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year in 2022.

Claim: Zelenskyy is a dictator
------------------------------

A professor who researches democracy and dictatorships said this is a mischaracterisation.

Zelenskyy was democratically elected in March 2019 to a five-year term with more than 73 percent of the vote. “Clearly, the term dictator does not apply to Zelenskyy, just as it does not apply to Churchill.”

A spokesperson for United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC it was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War II” and Zelenskyy is Ukraine’s “democratically elected leader”.

Putin won re-election to another six-year term in March in an election the US National Security Council said was “obviously not free nor fair”.

“Trump would be correct to use the term dictator to describe Putin, who has used fake elections to remain in power for a quarter of a century,” Moghaddam said.

Claim: Zelenskyy has a 4 percent approval rating
------------------------------------------------

This is inaccurate. That poll, Ukrainska Pravda said, is tied to the former chief political strategist of Ukraine’s fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, who Zelenskyy beat in 2019.

Claim: The US has spent $350bn to help Ukraine
----------------------------------------------

This is inaccurate. The official amount spent by the US on Ukraine is $183bn.

Zelenskyy wasn’t saying that the rest of the money was missing. Of $175bn appropriated by Congress, much of it was spent in the US on weapons manufacturers and US military and government operations.

Claim: Zelenskyy was ‘sleeping and unavailable’ to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week in Kyiv
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photos show this is inaccurate."

 !Zelenskyy: Ukraine received US$76 billion out of US$177 billion approved by America <image:3378>

Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We’re talking about tangible things because this aid didn’t come as cash but rather as weapons, which amounted to about US$70 billion.

But when it’s said that Ukraine received US$200 billion to support the army during the war – that’s not true. Probably, these various organisations were funded by different foundations."

**Background:**

*   In November 2024, Zelenskyy stated that [Ukraine has not received](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/11/16/7484807/)
     even half of the weapons officially allocated by the United States and that Europe has helped Ukraine just as much as the US.  
*   On his first day as president, Donald Trump signed an executive order [suspending all foreign aid programmes](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/21/7202989/)
     for 90 days to assess their alignment with his political goals. Officials and NGO representatives in Ukraine warned that without Rubio’s authorisation, essential programs, including support for schools, hospitals and efforts to develop economic and energy infrastructure, could face significant setbacks.
*   On 26 January, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine [was ordered to suspend all projects](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)
     and expenditures following a directive from the US Department of State. It’s significant aid, but it’s not US$200 billion." 

**Details:** Regarding the suspension of funding for humanitarian programmes, Zelenskyy highlighted specific cases such as a US$200 million energy-related programme and others in healthcare and border security.

**Quote:** "Those US$300-400 million are the programmes the state received."

The amounts mentioned vary slightly across sources, with figures around $75-76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion in aid. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms that Ukraine received a portion of the aid.

 is spent in the United States, about 25 percent is spent in Ukraine, and the final 15 percent is spent globally.

**Q1: What did President Zelensky say that started this controversy?**

**A1:** In an interview with the _Associated Press_ on February 2_,_ Zelensky [stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1igjyyl/zelenskyy_ukraine_received_us76_billion_out_of/)
:

When I hear that America gave Ukraine hundreds of billions \[of dollars\], 177, to be more precise . He speaks about supporting the “army” where aid helped all elements of the Ukrainian armed forces, and he appears to include only weapons as aid “received.”

**Q2: How was that interpreted?**

**A2:** Many people asked where the “missing” $100 billion went and seized on the statement, “I don’t know where all the money is.”

Comment sections of media reports [flamed with accusations of corruption and malfeasance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWcsdMUDDjc)
. However, it will take [many years](https://www.csis.org/analysis/aid-ukraine-explained-six-charts)
 for all the contracts to be completed and the money disbursed.

Critical Questions by [Mark F. surge forces in Europe, and intelligence support for both NATO and Ukraine.

As [CSIS has reported before](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/most-aid-to-ukraine-is-spent-in-the-us-a-total-shutdown-would-be-irresponsible/)
, “aid to Ukraine” is a misnomer because 90 percent of military aid is spent in the United States. We are talking about specific things, because we got it, not with money but with weapons. I don’t know where all the money is.

The statement is a bit confusing since he was speaking off the cuff in a video interview. Agency for International Development (USAID) payments to celebrities to visit Ukraine. [Members of Congress](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1886175308086161522)
 and Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, [amplified](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886132832495378684)
 posts questioning the misuse of aids.

General Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, denied these interpretations. In private conversations, Republican congressional staff members say that the confusion and hint of corruption have poisoned the possibility of further aid, at least in the near term.

**Q3: So, what happened to the “missing” $100 billion?**

**A3:** The short answer is that it is not missing."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published an analysis discussing the controversy surrounding U.S. aid to Ukraine. The article states that in an interview with the Associated Press on February 2, Zelenskyy said Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in aid. Zelenskyy's statement led to questions about where the "missing" $100 billion went, with accusations of corruption and malfeasance. The article explains that most of the aid is spent in the United States, and the "missing" money is not actually missing. <image:2135>

US President [Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 has hurled insults and personal attacks at the Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 and has since doubled down in a [post on X](https://archive.is/4NhOr "External link — post on X")
, heading for 100 million views at the time this article was published.

Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator without elections" who had lost the support of the Ukrainian people, telling him he "better move fast" to negotiate an end to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
 or he might not have a country left, among other things.

On Thursday, the US requested a [joint press conference be canceled](/en/ukraine-zelenskyy-wants-strong-ties-to-united-states/live-71678356)
 after talks between Zelenskyy and Trump's Ukraine envoy in Kyiv.

DW's [Fact Check team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 takes an in-depth look at Trump's claims.

Is Zelenskyy a dictator who is refusing to hold elections?    
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Trump said Zelenskyy was a "dictator without elections."

**DW Fact check:** False.

Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in April 2019, winning 74.96% of the vote in a second-round run-off with incumbent Petro Poroshenko.

According to the [Ukrainian constitution](https://perma.cc/VBX9-NHRY "External link — Ukrainian constitution")
, the next presidential election ought to have taken place on the final Sunday of March 2024, but it was postponed due to the imposition of martial law.

[Article 19 of the Ukrainian law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law"](https://archive.ph/1sxGv "External link — Article 19 of the Ukrainian law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law"")
 explicitly prohibits the holding of national and local elections during a state of war. According to the report, about 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy. An earlier poll published by the [International Republican Institute](https://www.iri.org/resources/national-survey-of-ukraine-sept-oct-2024/ "External link — International Republican Institute")
 last fall said that 69% of Ukrainians approved of his actions and 42% even strongly opposed elections for a new President.

Trump has not given a source for his single-digit claim.

In response, Zelenskyy said these false figures were part of Russia's disinformation campaign and the US President ["unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoq3IqIT90I "External link — "unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."")

According to recent polls, the majority of Ukrainians are satisfied with Zelenskyy as presidentImage: President of Ukraine/ZUMA Press/IMAGO

Has the US spent $350 billion on Ukraine?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim**: "Zelenskyy talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion."

**DW Factcheck**: Unproven. 

Trump didn't provide any sources for these amounts and the sum differs greatly from figures published elsewhere.

According to the US government's [Ukraine oversight working group](https://archive.ph/YMO0u "External link — Ukraine oversight working group")
, the US contribution to Ukraine aid totals $203 billion: "Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has appropriated or otherwise made available nearly $183 billion for Operation Atlantic Resolve and the broader Ukraine response. Article 71 of the Ukrainian constitution stipulates that elections are to be "free and take place on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot."

But with millions of Ukrainians serving in the armed forces, having fled the country, or living in areas occupied by the Russian army, it would be impossible to ensure the entire electorate is given an equal chance to vote by the required standards.

Is Zelenskyy running low in the polls?
--------------------------------------

**Claim:** Trump has claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval ratings have plummeted, saying he was "very low in Ukrainian polls" with a ["4% approval rating."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VneqUgovNVI "External link — "4% approval rating."")

**DW Fact check:** False.

Zelenskyy "retains a fairly high level of public trust," a poll conducted by the [Kyiv International Institute of Sociology](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=1496&page=1 "External link — Kyiv International Institute of Sociology")
 found in early February 2025. Additionally, the United States provided $20 billion in loans as part of the G7 nations extraordinary revenue acceleration loans initiative."

However, in reporting about Ukraine aid, the media often cite data collected by the [Ukraine Support Tracker (UST)](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/ "External link — Ukraine Support Tracker (UST)")
, a project by the German think tank, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Which is significantly less than the official US figures.

When asked about the gap between these figures and Trump's $350 billion claim, UST project leader Taro Nishikawa told DW: "This figure appears to be based on a different calculation and definition of aid. It may also include categories that we do not track in our dataset."

Can Ukraine-attached spending explain the gap?
----------------------------------------------

The UST's [dataset documentation](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/Subject_Dossiers_Topics/Ukraine/Ukraine_Support_Tracker/Dataset_Documentation.pdf "External link — dataset documentation")
 shows how difficult it is to define Ukraine aid.

For example, UST calculations do not include activities such as the training of Ukrainian soldiers, aid from NGOs that may be co-financed by governments or incentives for companies to donate to Ukraine. There are also multi-billion military and intelligence expenses by the US Department of Defense and the United States European Command which are dedicated to the region, but not exclusively to Ukraine.

At the same time, some analysts say that a large share of Ukraine's aid remains in the US economy.

[According to the US publication _Lawfare_](https://archive.ph/0meEI "External link — According to the US publication Lawfare")
: "Only a small percentage of the overall aid package takes the form of cash transfers to Kyiv." A significant part of the aid, the author writes, consists in paying US soldiers to train Ukrainian troops, or in sending weapons, ammunition and other military equipment from US stocks dedicated to rapid military aid under the [Foreign Assistance Act](https://perma.cc/J9ZN-8L37 "External link — Foreign Assistance Act")
. These stocks are then refilled by the US military industry.  While the US was subsidizing their economy the US government is still donating weaponry to Ukraine.

Even if you were to factor in all the funding somehow related to the war in Ukraine the UST had excluded from the grand total (see "Summary of US Acts" table), that would bring the overall US aid commitment for Ukraine up to $213 billion as of April 24, 2024 – a sum that surpasses the official figure, but still falls short of Trump's $350 billion claim.

Who has spent more on Ukraine: the USA or Europe?
-------------------------------------------------

**Claim**: "The United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe."

The claim fits Trump's talking point of everybody taking advantage of the US. With what Trump refers to as "Europe" giving shelter to more than 70%, and the US receiving less than 5% of them, his claim does not appear any more reasonable.

Content: "2 interview with The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine received a total of $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S as opposed to the reported $177 billion.

Russia’s ex-president, now deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev seized on Zelenskyy’s interview to claim in a Telegram post that the Ukrainian president “confessed” to being involved in the theft of $100 billion allocated by the United States to support Ukraine.

Medvedev used the name of a [controversial WWII figure Stepan Bandera](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2021/03/19/in-ukraine-stepan-bandera-s-legacy-becomes-a-political-football-again)
, one the prominent leaders of the Ukrainian Anti-Soviet rebellion, who joined the German Nazi regime for a promise of independence.

“In the heat of candor, the leader of the Bandera regime admitted that he and his comrades had embezzled $100 billion,” [Medvedev wrote](https://t.me/medvedev_telegram/563)
.

This claim is false.

Since the full-scale Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Of that, $106 billion is designated for direct support to Ukraine, comprising some $69.8 billion in military aid, $33.3 billion for budget support, and $2.8 billion in humanitarian assistance, as tracked by the Washington, D.C.-based [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)
.

The remaining funds support U.S. aid to countries affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine. military aid to Ukraine, reporting that most of it is spent in the U.S., used to build new weapons or replenish U.S. Nearly 90% of the $68 billion in military assistance benefits American workers, with 117 production lines across 31 states and 71 cities producing weapons for Ukraine.

_The Post_’s findings corroborated [earlier estimates](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/most-aid-to-ukraine-is-spent-in-the-us-a-total-shutdown-would-be-irresponsible/)

Kellogg also confirmed that part of the allocated funds has been used to produce weapons in the U.S. weapons stockpiles.

Russian state media disseminated and amplified Medvedev's statement, with state-owned media outlets, including [the Russian newspaper](https://rg.ru/2025/02/04/zelenskij-priznal-korrupciiu-na-milliardy-griven-v-kliuchevyh-finvedomstvah-ukrainy.html)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press published an interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, in Kyiv. Zelenskyy stated that excluding Ukraine from talks between the U.S. and Russia about the war would be "very dangerous." He also mentioned contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a "general level." <image:2120>, <image:2121>, <image:2122>, <image:2123>

U.S. News & World Report also published an article summarizing the AP interview with Zelenskyy, discussing his statements on talks between Moscow and Washington, the role of NATO, and skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine or whether Zelenskyy made any statements about it. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In an interview with the Associated Press on February 1, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine had received a portion of the U.S. aid. According to an article published by Izvestia ([https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine)), Zelenskyy said Kyiv received over $75 billion from Washington, and aid for $177 billion "not in money, but in weapons." Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked)) reported that Zelenskyy said Ukraine's military received only a portion of the billions in US aid, citing a total of $177bn or $200bn spent by the US, with Ukraine not receiving about $100bn of that total. Pravda.com.ua ([https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)) reported that Zelenskyy said Ukraine received about US$76 billion of the approximately US$177 billion in aid approved by the U.S. <image:3374>, <image:k>, <image:3378>


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview on February 1, 2025, that Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid. Multiple sources, including Izvestia, Al Jazeera, and Pravda.com.ua, report on Zelenskyy's statements regarding the aid. The amounts mentioned vary slightly across sources, with figures around $75-76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion in aid. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms that Ukraine received a portion of the aid.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid, with various sources citing figures around $76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion. The evidence also shows that a portion of the aid is used for purposes other than direct financial transfers to Ukraine, such as paying U.S. soldiers and for weapons and equipment. However, the evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation.

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

However, Ukraine’s government “never invested any funds into FTX,” Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine said [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1592241279051743233%7Ctwgr%5Eff3dcafd17a806bb6a0a472b14ff2c933ac7e1a9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fleadstories.com%2Fhoax-alert%2F2022%2F11%2Ffact-check-no-evidence-us-aid-to-ukraine-was-laundered-through-crypto-exchange-channeled-to-democrats.html)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

*   Russia's online disinformation campaign extended well beyond 2016 and focused heavily on the NFL kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to stoke racial tensions, according to a new Senate report. 
*   It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
. 

The Mueller probe catalyzed further inquires by House Democrats in Congress and continues to be mentioned in [discussions on the escalating Ukraine scandal](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/464845-house-lawyer-says-impeachment-probe-could-go-beyond-ukraine)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Netanyahu’s Visit to the White House Highlights Critical Foreign Policy Issues
==============================================================================

! President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the leaders discussed a range of issues, including Trump’s tariffs, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, and Türkiye-Israel relations, especially as tensions have escalated over each country’s role in a post-Assad Syria.
*   There have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as both countries battle for influence in Syria, although Trump suggested that he could serve as a mediator to help the two leaders move beyond their differences.
*   Hamas has been seriously degraded as a military force in Gaza but has not been destroyed, as Netanyahu promised in the opening weeks of Israel’s military campaign.
*   Trump also revealed during the White House meeting that the U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the leaders discussed a range of issues, including Trump’s tariffs, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, and Türkiye-Israel relations, especially as tensions have escalated over each country’s role in a post-Assad Syria.** It was Netanyahu’s [second visit](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-february-5/)
 to Washington D.C. Netanyahu is buoyed by his recent meeting with [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2022-april-7/)
, who welcomed Netanyahu and announced that Budapest would be withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has sought indictments for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for their role in Israel’s war in Gaza. <image:2171>

**Bottom Line Up Front**

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, although it is unclear whether key obstacles – such as Iranian support for its proxies or its ballistic missile program – will prove insurmountable.

**Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. Abroad, Israel has acted with free rein in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, emboldened both politically and militarily. However, there have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-erdogan-seeks-bigger-role-for-turkey-on-world-stage-but-at-what-cost/)
 as both countries battle for influence in Syria. On trade, tariffs levied against Israel remained at 17 percent, with no progress on that front during the meeting, even as Netanyahu promised to eliminate Israel’s trade deficit with the United States and dismantle existing trade barriers.

On Gaza, where Israel restarted its military offensive against Hamas three weeks ago, Netanyahu received no pressure or pushback from the Trump administration. While some would suggest that the Biden administration gave Netanyahu a blank check on dealing with Gaza, there were the occasional lectures on human rights and warnings about mounting civilian casualties."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit to the White House in April 2025 is false. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/), this information is a fake, and the article includes a screenshot of a Facebook post with an image of Netanyahu and Donald Trump (<image:2170>). The Soufan Center published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House and tensions between Israel and Turkey over Syria ([Thesoufancenter.org](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/) <image:2171>). The Jerusalem Post published an article about a bilateral dinner between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025 ([Jpost.com](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-863006) <image:1>).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the information is a fake, as reported by StopFake.org. The evidence also mentions a visit by Netanyahu to the White House in April 2025, but it does not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that the information is a fake.

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

**A fake Charlie Hebdo cover is being spread on Facebook. Notably, in March 2025, the magazine [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/domenico.farina.31/posts/10223728579482001)
 claims to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that this image was created by the magazine. It is fake.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Zelenskyy in a coffin. **[(RELATED: Is Elon Musk Paying The Salaries Of The Rescued Astronauts For A ‘Full Year?’)](https://checkyourfact.com/2025/03/24/fact-check-musk-paying-salaries-rescued-astronauts-full-year/)
**

“The political corpse emits its last gas’: a new illustration by the French political magazine Charlie Hebdo. A wider search of the [magazine’s website](https://charliehebdo.fr/)

, a Charlie Hebdo journalist, told [Logically Facts](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/charlie-hebdo-magazine-cover-featuring-zelenskyy-in-a-coffin-is-fake)
 that the image is fake.

* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:

* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French."

# Search Result
From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake."

Myth Detector ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) published on April 8, 2025, fact-checked the image, stating that the magazine did not publish an issue on March 20, 2025. The Daily Caller also reported on March 28, 2025, that the cover was fake ([Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)).

Without-lie.info ([Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)) also confirmed the cover's inauthenticity, noting the fake cover's release date as March 20, 2025, with issue number 1705. The real cover was published on March 19, 2025. The image is a fabrication, as confirmed by a Charlie Hebdo journalist. <image:14>, <image:4752>, <image:4758>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication. Multiple sources, including Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)), The Daily Caller ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)), and without-lie.info ([https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)), have fact-checked the image and confirmed its inauthenticity. The cover's release date of March 20, 2025, is also incorrect, as the magazine did not publish an issue on that date.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources confirm that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication. The image is not authentic, and the magazine did not publish an issue with that cover. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication, as confirmed by fact-checks from sources like Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) and The Daily Caller ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)). The image's release date and content are not authentic.

Content: "These changes take place amid [intensified](https://www.csis.org/programs/futures-lab/projects/russian-firepower-strike-tracker-analyzing-missile-attacks-ukraine)

, albeit slowly and at high human and material costs.

Yet, much is unknown about the new policy, and the details will affect the speed of weapons delivery, the effectiveness of the deliveries, and the policy’s political acceptability. stockpiles and competing military needs—remain.

These Critical Questions lay out the status of the program and its future in six graphs and a table.

**Q1: What was the state of military aid to Ukraine when the Trump administration took office?**

**A1:** Before leaving office, the Biden administration had made announcements covering all the available funding for military aid. inventories; Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI, $33 billion) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS, $1 billion), whereby the United States provides funds to Ukraine, and Ukraine contracts with U.S. This occurred because of the delay between announcing an aid package and its delivery to Ukraine; that delay varies according to the delivery mechanism.

PDA weapons arrive quickly, generally within six months of the announcement. <image:4789>](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-07/250715_Cancian_Ukraine_Fig3_0.jpg?VersionId=V1AxH80qeBcycy.x1d9Io9mEK3DFxYvv)

**Q3: What has been the history of aid flow under the Trump administration?**

**A3:** The table below lays out the Trump administration’s actions since taking office in January.

Remote Visualization

**Q4: What aid did the DOD pause on July 1, and why?**

**A4:** Although the specific items paused were not released publicly, they apparently included a Patriot, other air defense systems, and ammunition. Colby has [long](https://hopkinspofa.com/2023/02/13/is-ukraine-a-distraction/)
 [argued](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ukraine-is-a-distraction-from-taiwan-russia-china-nato-global-powers-military-invasion-jinping-biden-putin-europe-11644781247)
 that the Russia-Ukraine War is a distraction from the primary competition with China and that aid to Ukraine diverts limited resources desperately needed to counter the Chinese military threat. In this, other “[Pacific prioritizers](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/managing-trade-offs-between-military-aid-taiwan-and-ukraine)
” have joined Colby.

Importantly, the administration no longer argues that aid is being abused and [that Ukraine is corrupt](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jr-ukraine-corrupt-comments-b2068536.html)
. Funds could also come from the [defense loan mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1340)
 recently [established](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-envoys-reach-deal-150-billion-euro-arms-fund-2025-05-21/)
 by the European Union.

The deal with NATO meets one of the White House’s concerns, that support for Ukraine has been too costly to U.S. However, the DOD’s reluctance to lift the pause is evident in [its terse announcement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4236261/statement-by-chief-pentagon-spokesman-sean-parnell-on-ukraine-military-aid/)
, saying that it was done “at President Trump’s direction” and that the DOD would continue its evaluation “of military shipments across the globe.”

Under the deal with NATO, the politics and financial realities of U.S."

Ukraine says it has uncovered major arms corruption

The SBU said defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided

**Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m).**

The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.

It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.

Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.

Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

The SBU said an investigation had "exposed" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, "who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells".

"According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement," it said.

The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, "not a single artillery shell" was ever sent.

One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said.

Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.

Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.

The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.

In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.

Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a [2022 corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022)
 by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.

But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference. It is one of only 10 countries steadily climbing Transparency International's ranking, rising 28 places in a decade.

While Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. (In comparison, Ukraine's spending on legal arms for defense in 1999 is estimated to have been $500 million.) Many of the missing weapons found their way into the hands of willing buyers in hot spots around the globe, from Sierra Leone to Croatia."

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft and discount arms sales. Ukraine has gained a reputation as one of the world's most active suppliers of illegal small arms.

## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reports that the State Department approved $322 million in weapons sales to Ukraine, including supplies, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles and surface-to-air missile systems. (<image:0>) The CSIS analysis discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including the announcements and deliveries of weapons. (<image:4789>, <image:4790>) The article mentions the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) as mechanisms for providing funds to Ukraine.

The search result from forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States. The aid includes various armaments, ammunition, and equipment. The United States has provided small arms and ammunition seized from Iranian forces. The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

 the homes and offices of arms dealers across the country Tuesday as part of a corruption investigation launched by Ukraine, officials said.

The raids, carried out in multiple regions including Sofia, followed a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is probing alleged overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv.

Acting Interior Ministry Secretary General Miroslav Rashkov said no arrests had been made and that the searches were being conducted under the supervision of the National Investigation Service. Many deliveries are routed through intermediaries before reaching Ukrainian buyers, a process now under scrutiny in several countries.

Rashkov said the operation remained underway Tuesday afternoon and declined to speculate on possible arrests or charges.

Future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict

*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/arms-trafficking/)
    
*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/violence-fragility/)
    

*   [! What this means for organized crime, and specifically the smuggling of weapons and ammunition into Europe is unclear, but by using scenario modelling we can divine insights and provide concrete recommendations.

On 20–21 January 2025, the GI-TOC hosted a conference in Brussels to discuss three potential trajectories of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the ramifications of each on arms trafficking dynamics in Europe.

The conference gamed three scenarios – a peace agreement, a stalemate conflict and a decisive victory for Ukraine or Russia. Some leakage must be expected, and understanding this reality should persuade policymakers to act sooner rather than wait for a trigger event in a European city.

#### Key points

*   Draft, support and implement policy measures that reduce arms trafficking risks in Ukraine, including (when it is formulated) Ukraine’s demobilization law, and its security sector reform and veteran policy.
*   Improve Europe-wide operational capabilities in terms of information sharing, coordination and access to data.
*   The arms trafficking trade is likely to be multifaceted: a small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors.
*   ‘Traditional’ organized crime may be involved in arms trafficking alongside other more lucrative activities, like the drug trade, but ex-military personnel may form a new class of ‘brokers’, using connections with other military and politicians to set up larger-scale operations.
*   Tailor responses that recognize demand is king: the right kit for the right customer. <image:1112>\

Smoke on the horizon: Trends in arms trafficking from the conflict in Ukraine\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)

[! Participants were asked to respond, from the perspective of organized crime, law enforcement and multilateral policymakers, to emergent arms trafficking dynamics, working through various turns to discover second- and third-order implications. Asking participants to step outside their role and think like a criminal is rewarding and illuminates the discussion, while building trust and personal connections.

The purpose of this exercise was to provide policymakers with a forward-looking perspective that would map the potential risk of arms trafficking across a range of situations, point up gaps in responses and develop specific and measurable policy response options for national authorities to implement with the aim of reducing the risks of illicit firearms markets in Europe from the conflict.

Fostering international cooperation and information-sharing was also a primary goal of the conference. More than 60 high-level stakeholders attended from a range of organizations focusing on arms trafficking.

#### Understanding the risk

Understanding of the risks of arms trafficking arising from the conflict has improved since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Yet recent research suggests criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes and supply chains, and the scale of the problem is much larger than past occurrences of large-scale diversion, such as the Balkans and Afghanistan. Experts and policymakers in neighbouring and other European countries continue to express their concerns about the threat of large-scale diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine. An overarching conclusion was that policy responses must flexible and scalable from the start.

**Use lessons learned (and learn new ones)**

The conference highlighted the fact that many policy bodies in Europe have a deep and multilayered understanding of the legacy of the Balkans conflict on arms trafficking trends in Europe."

The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

### MoIA Launches the Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking

! Taking into account the EU recommendations and ensuring the proper functioning of the Coordination Centre, we are making our contribution to the development of the European security architecture,” the Minister added.

In his turn, Ambassador Petr Mareš, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairmanship and Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine, said that the issue of arms trafficking is becoming increasingly acute due to russia’s full-scale invasion, but the creation of the Coordination Centre will help to effectively counteract this problem. Achieving synergy in combating illicit arms trafficking is of great importance to us, as we are aware that the war is ongoing, and only through joint efforts can we ensure security in Ukraine and Europe,” he said.

In response, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stressed that, with the assistance of international partners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is implementing a number of joint projects aimed at building the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies.

Harshet Virk, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Programme Office in Ukraine, stressed that owing to the coordinated and efficient efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, not a single weapon was trafficked to the European Union: “I sincerely congratulate you on the establishment of the Coordination Centre – this is an important step in the fight against crime and illicit arms trafficking. <image:1118>

Harshet Virk noted that her team will continue to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by providing software and organising relevant trainings.

Maura O’Sullivan, the Acting Head of the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, said that the Centre is a reliable solution for monitoring the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the area of combating illicit arms trafficking: “We are ready to continue to support you and facilitate the rapid exchange of information. The main tasks of the Centre are:

– processing and systematisation of information received;

– coordinating the actions of state authorities, institutions and organisations on combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– ensuring the exchange of information between the authorities of Ukraine and partner countries;

– obtaining complete information about weapons;

– improving the legal framework for combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– identifying ways and means of solving problematic issues.

(<image:0>) The CSIS analysis discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including the announcements and deliveries of weapons. (<image:4789>, <image:4790>) The article mentions the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) as mechanisms for providing funds to Ukraine.

The search result from forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States. The aid includes various armaments, ammunition, and equipment. The United States has provided small arms and ammunition seized from Iranian forces. The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

Ukraine Weapons Sales

Weapons Sales are presented as a Trend-Indicator Value based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons such as aircraft, air defence systems, anti-submarine warfare weapons, armoured vehicles, artillery, engines, missiles, sensors, satellites, ships and others. The indicator aims to represent the transfer value of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alexander Cook

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).
    
*   **North Korea** exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine."

* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine arms sales US aid")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reports that the State Department approved $322 million in weapons sales to Ukraine, including supplies, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles and surface-to-air missile systems. (<image:0>) The CSIS analysis discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including the announcements and deliveries of weapons. (<image:4789>, <image:4790>) The article mentions the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) as mechanisms for providing funds to Ukraine.

The search result from forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States. The aid includes various armaments, ammunition, and equipment. The United States has provided small arms and ammunition seized from Iranian forces. The result also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results mention the approval of weapons sales to Ukraine and the provision of military aid, but they do not provide any information about Ukraine selling these armaments. The evidence also mentions that the Pentagon did not properly track $1 billion worth of military equipment sent to Ukraine, but this does not confirm the claim either.

To verify the claim, information about the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of these armaments is needed.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News reports that Ukraine's security service uncovered corruption in an arms purchase worth about $40 million. (<image:4880>, <image:4881>) PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, mentioning that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998, in part through theft and discount arms sales. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reports that Bulgarian authorities searched arms dealers' homes and offices as part of a corruption investigation launched by Ukraine, probing alleged overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv. (<image:0>)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published an article discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, noting that criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains. (<image:1112>) The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched the Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking to counteract illegal arms trafficking and ensure information exchange between Ukrainian authorities and partner countries.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has faced corruption issues in arms purchases and is actively working to combat illicit arms trafficking. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not provide any specific data on the volume of arms sales or the origin of the armaments being sold.
