## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Reuters article published on March 7, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval rating rose to 67% in March 2025, up from 57% a month earlier, based on a poll conducted from February 14 to March 4. The article mentions a "White House spat" between Zelenskyy and Donald Trump on February 28, 2025. ABC News, published on February 19, 2025, states that Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025, while polls showed Zelenskyy's approval rating was over 50% ![image 1820](media/2025-08-07_19-08-1754593730-392200.jpg). Euronews, published on February 19, 2025, reported that Zelenskyy's approval rating was 57% in early February 2025, contradicting Trump's claim of 4% support <image:0>.

## Elaboration
The claim that Zelenskyy's approval rating was down at 4% in February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. ABC News and Euronews reported that polls showed Zelenskyy's approval rating was over 50% and 57%, respectively, in February 2025. Reuters also reported a rise in his approval rating in March 2025, further indicating that the 4% figure is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including Reuters, ABC News, and Euronews, show that Zelenskyy's approval rating in February 2025 was significantly higher than 4%. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE
