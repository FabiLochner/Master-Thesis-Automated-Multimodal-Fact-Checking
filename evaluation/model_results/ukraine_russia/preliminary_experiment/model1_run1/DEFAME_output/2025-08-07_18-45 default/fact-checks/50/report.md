## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article stating that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine, which Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed to negotiate (![image 1007](media/2025-08-06_18-20-1754504425-007992.jpg)). A Wikipedia article discusses the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025, and mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" (<image:i>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in February 2025, Annalena Baerbock commented on Donald Trump's actions and statements regarding Ukraine. Specifically, she stated that Ukraine's interests must be protected in ceasefire negotiations and described Trump's conduct as a "new era of ruthlessness." However, the provided evidence does not mention Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available information. The evidence does not support the assertion that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US.

To verify the claim, information about whether Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, a fact-check from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html)) stated that Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the United States (![image 2216](media/2025-08-07_20-10-1754597431-578820.jpg), ![image 2217](media/2025-08-07_20-10-1754597431-935941.jpg)). Press TV ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/22/743256/German-FM--Europeans-to-put-pressure-on-US,-keep-US-from-bilateral-relations-with-Russia](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/22/743256/German-FM--Europeans-to-put-pressure-on-US,-keep-US-from-bilateral-relations-with-Russia)) reported that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US to prevent an alliance with Russia (![image 2240](media/2025-08-07_20-10-1754597452-729209.jpg)). Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/europeans-ramp-pressure-us-german-143422657.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/europeans-ramp-pressure-us-german-143422657.html)) stated that Baerbock said European allies should put more pressure on the US to avoid losing Washington as a partner (![image 2245](media/2025-08-07_20-11-1754597462-283111.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to sever ties with the US in February 2025. A fact-check from aol.com explicitly states this. Instead, Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US to maintain the partnership.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to sever ties with the US in February 2025. While she did comment on US actions regarding Ukraine and urged European allies to pressure the US, there is no evidence to support the claim that she threatened to sever ties.
