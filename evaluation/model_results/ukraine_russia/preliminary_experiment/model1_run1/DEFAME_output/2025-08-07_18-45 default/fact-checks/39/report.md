The provided evidence confirms that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot and killed in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about White being on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Alex Jones claimed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian "hit list," according to [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418). ![image 2102](media/2025-08-07_19-38-1754595539-936755.jpg) White had previously posted on X that he was on a Ukrainian "Enemies List" in June 2024. StopFake.org states there is no evidence White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine." ![image 2108](media/2025-08-07_19-39-1754595552-498748.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Alex Jones claimed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian "hit list." White himself had previously posted on X that he was on a Ukrainian "Enemies List" in June 2024. However, StopFake.org states there is no evidence White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine."


## Final Judgement
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list after being shot dead is misleading. While Alex Jones made this claim, and White himself claimed to be on a list, there is no evidence to support this.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While Alex Jones claimed Jamie White was on a Ukrainian "hit list," and White himself claimed to be on a list, there is no evidence to support this. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/), there is no evidence White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine."
