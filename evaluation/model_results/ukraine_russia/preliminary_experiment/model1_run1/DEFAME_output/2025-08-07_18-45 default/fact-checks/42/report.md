According to an article published by Pravda.com.ua on February 2, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated in an interview with the Associated Press that Ukraine had received approximately $76 billion of the roughly $177 billion in aid approved by the U.S. The aid was primarily in the form of weapons, totaling about $70 billion. ![image 2124](media/2025-08-07_19-52-1754596360-289048.jpg)

An article from the Council on Foreign Relations, published on July 15, 2025, discusses U.S. aid to Ukraine, mentioning that President Donald Trump froze military aid in early March 2025, but lifted the freeze shortly after. NPR published an article on August 5, 2025, discussing U.S. aid to Ukraine and a "productive conversation" between Zelenskyy and Trump. ![image 2132](media/2025-08-07_19-52-1754596367-248834.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a CSIS.org article, in an interview with the Associated Press on February 2, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine had received $76 billion out of $177 billion in aid, leading to questions about the remaining funds (![image 2135](media/2025-08-07_19-53-1754596388-246828.jpg)). A DW.COM fact-check article addresses claims about U.S. aid to Ukraine, stating that the U.S. contribution totals $203 billion. The Voice of America reported that Zelenskyy stated Ukraine received $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S., not the reported $177 billion, and that the U.S. has designated $106 billion for direct support to Ukraine (![image 2137](media/2025-08-07_19-53-1754596400-258067.jpg)).

## Elaboration
1.  The new evidence indicates that Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview on February 2, 2025, that Ukraine had received approximately $76 billion of the roughly $177 billion in U.S. aid.
2.  The evidence also shows that the U.S. aid was primarily in the form of weapons, totaling about $70 billion.
3.  The claim states that Zelenskyy's statement confirms that the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to support this assertion.
4.  Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. The evidence only provides information about the amount of aid received and does not mention any money laundering activities.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-ukraine-fraud-probe-zelensky-2038142): 
Content: Newsweek published an article discussing a potential probe into the use of U.S. aid to Ukraine. The article mentions that Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) is looking into potential problems with the aid. The article also mentions that Zelensky denied there was a major problem with waste and fraud. The article was written by Peter Aitken and published in 2024. ![image 2142](media/2025-08-07_19-53-1754596439-337154.jpg)


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence from Newsweek indicates that there were discussions about potential fraud and waste related to U.S. aid to Ukraine.
2.  Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) was reportedly looking into the matter.
3.  Zelenskyy denied that there was a major problem with waste and fraud.
4.  The claim states that Zelenskyy's statement confirms that the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation. However, the evidence does not provide any information to support this assertion.
5.  Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. The evidence mentions potential fraud and waste but does not confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy stated Ukraine received a portion of U.S. aid. While there were discussions about potential fraud and waste, there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money laundering operation.

`not enough information`


### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms U.S. aid is a money laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. While Zelenskyy did state that Ukraine received a portion of the U.S. aid, and there were discussions about potential fraud and waste, there is no evidence to confirm the aid was a money laundering operation.
