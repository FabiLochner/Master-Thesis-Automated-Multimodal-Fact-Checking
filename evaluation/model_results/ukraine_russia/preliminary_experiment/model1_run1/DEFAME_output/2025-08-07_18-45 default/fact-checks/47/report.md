## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fabricated, according to multiple sources. Mythdetector.com ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) states that the magazine did not release an issue on March 20, 2025, and the issue number on the image matches the one published on March 26. The Daily Caller, as reported by aol.com ([Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-charlie-hebdo-magazine-151901596.html)), also confirmed the image's inauthenticity, with a Charlie Hebdo journalist confirming it. Without-lie.info ([Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)) claims that the cover was distributed by Russian propaganda channels. ![image 2179](media/2025-08-07_20-06-1754597162-208484.jpg) ![image 2185](media/2025-08-07_20-06-1754597200-801130.jpg) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)
