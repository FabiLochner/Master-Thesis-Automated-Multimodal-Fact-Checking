Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/10/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-putin-fears-only-trump-china): 
Content: On December 9, 2024, Al Jazeera reported on Zelenskyy's remarks, including a statement on X (formerly Twitter) where he said that Putin "fears only [Trump] and, perhaps, China." <image:0> The article also mentions a meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump, and Macron in Paris on December 7, 2024.

The claim 'In a press conference on December 9, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: 'I will ask Biden to invite me to NATO ... there's no point in talking to Trump.'' is misleading.
Justification: On December 9, 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated, "And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," as reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-president-zelenskiy-says-no-point-discussing-with-trump-2024-12-09/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-president-zelenskiy-says-no-point-discussing-with-trump-2024-12-09/)). This statement aligns with the claim's sentiment about not discussing certain matters with Trump. The evidence also supports the context of the claim by mentioning Zelenskyy's intention to discuss NATO membership with Biden. However, the exact quote from the claim is not fully present in the evidence, but the sentiment is.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
