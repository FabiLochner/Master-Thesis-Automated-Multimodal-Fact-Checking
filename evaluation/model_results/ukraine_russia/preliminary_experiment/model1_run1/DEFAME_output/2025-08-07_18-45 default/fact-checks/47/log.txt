Useful result: From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: The search result from without-lie.info states that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake. The website claims that the magazine did not publish an issue with that cover on March 20, 2025, and that the cover was distributed by Russian propaganda channels. <image:1> The article also mentions that the real Charlie Hebdo cover was published on March 19, 2025.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The image of the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin is fabricated. Multiple sources, including Mythdetector.com ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) and a Charlie Hebdo journalist, confirm its inauthenticity. The issue number and date on the image do not match the magazine's actual publications, and the cover was distributed by Russian propaganda channels.

So, the overall veracity is: false
