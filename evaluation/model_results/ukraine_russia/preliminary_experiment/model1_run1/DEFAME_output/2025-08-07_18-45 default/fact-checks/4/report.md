## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss claims about British Special Forces casualties in Odesa, Ukraine. One claim, made by Dutch journalist Sonja van den Ende, alleges that a Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers. This claim has been debunked by the Ukrainian military. Another source states that the press service of the Tavria Operational grouping of troops and the speaker of the Ukrainian Navy denied the information. The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council also drew attention to this. A separate article from EADaily reports that Russian special forces captured two British officers in Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim about 18 British Special Forces soldiers being killed in the Odessa region in Ukraine is false. Multiple sources, including the Ukrainian military and the Center for Countering Disinformation, have debunked this claim. The claim originated from a Dutch journalist, Sonja van den Ende.

The search results also mention that Russian special forces captured two British officers in Ukraine. However, this does not validate the claim about the 18 casualties.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim is not supported.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces killed in the Odessa region in Ukraine is false. Multiple sources, including the Ukrainian military, have debunked this claim.
