Content: Reuters reported that Lech Wałęsa, along with 39 former Polish political prisoners, signed a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025, criticizing Trump's argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The letter expressed "horror and distaste" at Trump's behavior and called on the U.S. to fulfill security guarantees given to Ukraine in 1994. The letter also stated that gratitude is due to Ukrainian soldiers for defending the values of the free world. <image:1967> The article was published by Reuters.

The claim 'In March 2025 former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing the U.S. President's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.' is not enough information.
Justification: In March 2025, Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing his behavior towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and urging the fulfillment of security guarantees, as reported by Reuters ([https://ca.news.yahoo.com/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-120858761.html](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-120858761.html)). However, the available evidence does not explicitly confirm that the letter specifically addressed or criticized Trump's decision to suspend U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
