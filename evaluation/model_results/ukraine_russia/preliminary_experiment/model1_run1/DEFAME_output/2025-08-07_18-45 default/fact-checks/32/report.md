## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris made a statement about Ukraine and Russia. The IMDb.com source ([Source](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)) provides a quote that matches the first part of the claim.

The evidence does not include the phrase "So basically that's wrong." Therefore, the claim is partially accurate.
