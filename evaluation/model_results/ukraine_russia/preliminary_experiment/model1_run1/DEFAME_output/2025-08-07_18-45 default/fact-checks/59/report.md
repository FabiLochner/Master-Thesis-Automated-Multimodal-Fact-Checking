### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a book titled "All the President's Money" by James Comer (![image 2356](media/2025-08-07_20-31-1754598686-733132.jpg)), an image of a person with money in their pocket (![image 2357](media/2025-08-07_20-31-1754598687-057442.jpg)), and an Al Jazeera article about a corruption scheme uncovered in Ukraine's defense sector (![image 2358](media/2025-08-07_20-31-1754598687-249894.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there are concerns about corruption related to Ukraine aid and that Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi have been mentioned in connection to these concerns. However, the evidence does not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes taken by US politicians, nor does it confirm the amounts listed in the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of evidence.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 18](media/59.jpg))
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The initial search results mention corruption concerns and investigations related to Ukraine and some US politicians, but they do not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes. The reverse image search did not yield any additional information to support the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim presents an image purporting to be a list of US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. While there are discussions about corruption and investigations related to Ukraine and some US politicians, there is no evidence to support the existence or authenticity of the list presented in the image. Therefore, the claim is misleading because it presents an unverified list as factual. `misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While there are discussions about corruption related to Ukraine and some US politicians, the provided evidence, including web and image searches, does not support the existence or authenticity of the list presented in the image. The search results mention corruption concerns and investigations related to Ukraine and some US politicians, but they do not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes.
