## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025. A Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) mentions the meeting and a subsequent social media post by Trump. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) reports on an abrupt end to the visit after an "Oval Office spat".

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) details a heated meeting, with Trump and Zelenskyy clashing over a deal regarding Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances. The article does not contain the quote in the claim. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>, ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House in February 2025, which ended abruptly after a heated exchange. However, the Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) does not contain the quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim.

Therefore, the evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy made the specific statement about the U.S. having to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a reliable source that quotes Zelenskyy making the statement.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that Volodymyr Zelenskyy did make a statement about the U.S. having to send their sons and daughters to war. Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)) and DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118)) both report on this statement, with DW.com providing the quote: "If Ukraine loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO states, then the US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly in the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war."

Times Now News ([https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186)) also quotes Zelenskyy saying, "The US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending sons and daughters to war." The statement was made in the context of a discussion about NATO Article 5. <image:i>, <image:x>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a statement about the U.S. having to send their sons and daughters to war. The quote, "If Ukraine loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO states, then the US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly in the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war," is attributed to him by DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118)).

However, the evidence does not specify that this statement was made during a heated exchange with Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025. The context of the statement, according to Times Now News ([https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186)), was a discussion about NATO Article 5.

Therefore, while Zelenskyy did make the statement, the claim's context (the White House meeting in February 2025) is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially true. While Zelenskyy did make a statement about the U.S. having to send their sons and daughters to war, the evidence does not support that this statement was made during a heated exchange with Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025. The context of the statement was a discussion about NATO Article 5.

`misleading`


### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy did state that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to war, as reported by [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118) and [Times Now News](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/video-of-zelenskyy-talking-about-nato-article-5-resurfaces-amid-world-war-3-row-send-their-sons-watch-article-118668186), the context of the statement was a discussion about NATO Article 5, not a heated exchange with Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.
