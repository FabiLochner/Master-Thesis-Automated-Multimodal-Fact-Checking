Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2017/03/30/522055235/senate-intelligence-committee-vice-chair-blasts-putin): 
Content: The NPR article discusses Adam Schiff's work on the Russia investigation. It mentions that Sen. Mark Warner accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to undermine the 2016 presidential election. The article also mentions the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. <image:2592>, <image:2590>

The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including CNN and NPR, indicates that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee due to Schiff's past involvement in investigations and impeachments of former President Donald Trump, not because of his work on the Russia investigation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
