## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results confirm the existence of the "Hull Daily Mail" issue from March 13, 2025, and provide a link to the newspaper's front page from that date. One source, from mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/](https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/)), fact-checks the claim about the front page, stating that the image is fabricated and the actual cover does not mention Ukraine. ![image 1](media/0.jpg) ![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg)

Another source, from Magzter ([https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2](https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2)), also shows the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025. ![image 73](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501202-576951.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/1998652?srsltid=AfmBOopqPghYNua5NJ0AXT6CgPQgEG6MBQ4wQPau_1S2zl9NEtaSFjcH): 
Content: The search result is a Hull Daily Mail front page from February 18, 2025. ![image 1522](media/2025-08-07_18-47-1754592440-549668.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image of the Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, is fabricated. The search results confirm the existence of the newspaper on that date, but the actual front page, as shown by Magzter, does not contain the text about Ukrainian soldiers. The mythdetector.com source explicitly labels the image as fabricated.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. While the Hull Daily Mail did publish an edition on March 13, 2025, the front page shown in the image is fabricated. The actual front page, as shown by multiple sources, does not contain the text about Ukrainian soldiers. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the Hull Daily Mail did publish an edition on March 13, 2025, the front page image is fabricated. The actual front page, as shown by sources like [Magzter](https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2), does not contain the text about Ukrainian soldiers. This is further supported by a fact-check from mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/](https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/)), which labels the image as fabricated.
