Useful result: From [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/): 
Content: The search result from Statista.com provides a chart showing arms imports from Ukraine by country from 2018 to 2024 <image:7271>. The chart indicates that China was the largest importer of arms from Ukraine.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States is not supported by the available evidence. While there is evidence of arms trafficking and corruption within Ukraine, as reported by sources like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/), there is no specific data to confirm the claim. Furthermore, although Ukraine exports arms, as shown by [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/), the origin of these arms is not specified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
