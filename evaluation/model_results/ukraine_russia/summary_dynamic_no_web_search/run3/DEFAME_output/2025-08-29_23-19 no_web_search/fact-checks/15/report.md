## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Euronews.com reported that Zelenskyy's approval rating was 57% in February 2025, contradicting a claim of 4% support (![image 7068](media/2025-08-29_23-21-1756509694-866208.jpg)). The Pew Research Center published a survey in July 2024 showing mixed views of Zelenskyy globally (![image 7069](media/2025-08-29_23-21-1756509694-990361.jpg)).



### Evidence from `image_search`
A Reuters/Ipsos poll from February 25, 2025, indicates a 44% approval rating for the president (![image 7079](media/2025-08-29_23-21-1756509704-661787.jpg)). Data from KIIS.com.ua shows the Ukrainian president's approval rating at 63% between December 2024 and January 2025 (![image 7080](media/2025-08-29_23-21-1756509705-132652.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval rating was at 4% in February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Euronews.com reported a 57% approval rating for Zelenskyy in February 2025. Additionally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from February 25, 2025, indicates a 44% approval rating. Data from KIIS.com.ua shows the Ukrainian president's approval rating at 63% between December 2024 and January 2025.


## Final Judgement
The evidence contradicts the claim. Multiple sources show Zelenskyy's approval rating in February 2025 to be significantly higher than 4%.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

Evidence from multiple sources, including Euronews.com and a Reuters/Ipsos poll, indicates that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval rating in February 2025 was significantly higher than 4%. Specifically, Euronews.com reported 57%, and the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 44%. Additionally, data from KIIS.com.ua shows a 63% approval rating between December 2024 and January 2025.
