However, none of the summaries mention whether Hegseth called Putin a war criminal.


## Elaboration
I am unable to verify the claim. The search results provide images of Pete Hegseth from various news sources, including CNN, The New York Times, and PBS NewsHour. However, none of the summaries of these articles mention whether Hegseth called Putin a war criminal.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide images of Pete Hegseth from various news sources, but none of the summaries mention whether he called Putin a war criminal. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results from CNN, The New York Times, and PBS NewsHour, which feature images of Pete Hegseth, do not provide any information to verify the claim that he called Putin a war criminal. Therefore, the claim is unverified.
