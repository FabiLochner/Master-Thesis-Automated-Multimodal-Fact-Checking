The claim 'U.S. Vice President JD Vance's cousin Nate Vance fought in Ukraine for three years during its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that JD Vance's cousin, Nate Vance, fought in Ukraine for three years cannot be verified. While evidence confirms that Nate Vance is a volunteer fighter and a veteran of the war in Ukraine, the provided sources do not specify the duration of his service.

So, the overall veracity is: false
