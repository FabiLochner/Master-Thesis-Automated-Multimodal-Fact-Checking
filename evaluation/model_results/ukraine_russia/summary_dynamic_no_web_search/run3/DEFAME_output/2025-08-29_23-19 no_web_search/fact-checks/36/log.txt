The claim 'Russian state TV aired nude photos of Melania Trump shortly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election.' is false.
Justification: Multiple sources, including [La Voce di New York](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/11/12/melania-trump-risque-photos-aired-on-russian-tv-prime-time/), [Livemint.com](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russian-media-air-nude-pics-of-melania-trump-after-donald-trump-wins-in-us-polls-netizens-say-russia-laughing-at-us-11731216282862.html), and [bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/news/international/russian-tv-shows-nude-pictures-of-melania-trump-2442245.html), confirm that Russian state TV aired nude photos. However, while Livemint.com mentions the airing happened after Donald Trump won the US polls, the evidence does not explicitly confirm the timing relative to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

So, the overall veracity is: false
