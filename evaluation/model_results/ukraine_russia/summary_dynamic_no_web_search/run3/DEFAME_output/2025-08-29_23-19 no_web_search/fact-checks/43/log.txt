Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-03/ukraine-tightens-military-procurement-after-corruption-shakeup): 
Content: Bloomberg published an article on May 3, 2024, about Ukraine tightening military procurement after a corruption shakeup. <image:7212>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thepolicypractice.com/ukraines-anti-corruption-drama-temporary-victory-battle-far-over): 
Content: The Policy Practice published an article about Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts. <image:7213>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War published a fact sheet about US assistance to Ukraine. The fact sheet includes a claim that US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability are extensive and growing. <image:7214>

The claim 'Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that half of US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. While there are reports about corruption and oversight related to the aid, none of the sources, including articles from Reuters, ABC News, Politico, Bloomberg, and the Institute for the Study of War ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet)), mention any such activity.

So, the overall veracity is: false
