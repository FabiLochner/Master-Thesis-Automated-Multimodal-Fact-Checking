Content: Vanity Fair discusses Elon Musk's retweet claiming USAID funded celebrities' trip to Ukraine. <image:7255>

The claim 'E! News reported that the United States Agency Aid and Development (USAID) paid millions for celebrities to visit Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. While images with the E! News and USAID logos exist, the BBC Verify graphic indicates the claim is false. Furthermore, the claim was retweeted by Elon Musk, but the Vanity Fair article discussing the retweet does not confirm the claim's veracity, and the Gwara Media article debunks it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
