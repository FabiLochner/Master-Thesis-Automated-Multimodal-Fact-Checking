Useful result: From [Source](https://factcheckkorea.afp.com/doc.afp.com.324U6AA): Found exact image on website with title: 이 사진은 1993년 영국 에어쇼 도중 발생한 사고를 촬영한 것이다
Content: The image is of a Russian MiG-29 fighter jet involved in an accident during a British air show in 1993. <image:5> The image was taken by Carl Ford on July 24, 1993, at Fairford, England. The article was published on March 11, 2022, by AFP 인도 and translated by SHIM Kyu-Seok.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, as confirmed by reverse image searches on sites like [Airteam Images](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672). This contradicts the claim that it shows a US F-16 shot down in 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
