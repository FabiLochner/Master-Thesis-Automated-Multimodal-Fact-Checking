The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported. Multiple searches for the alleged statement by Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an AP News interview from February 1, 2025, regarding U.S. aid being a money laundering operation yielded no evidence to support the claim. The search results included articles from AP News, CNN, and others ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russian-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-news-conference-5440b3d3034a34461d93d0740e0c1ae6), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/politics/republicans-trump-ukraine-aid)), but none contained the specific statement or supported the assertion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
