## Elaboration
The search results provide additional context about Elon Musk and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they do not confirm the authenticity of the X post. The AOL article mentions fact-checking Elon Musk, which suggests that his posts are sometimes subject to scrutiny.

I still need to find the original X post to verify the Claim.

## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are public figures and have interacted with each other. However, the search results do not provide any information about the authenticity of the X post in the Claim. The image in the claim shows a doctored dollar bill with Donald Trump's image on it, which suggests the post is not authentic.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are public figures who have interacted, the image in the claim depicts a doctored dollar bill, indicating the X post is not authentic.
