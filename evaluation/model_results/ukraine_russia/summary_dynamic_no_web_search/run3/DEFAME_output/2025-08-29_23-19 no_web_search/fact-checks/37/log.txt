The claim 'In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While images from sources like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html), [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/02/gershkovich-russia-us-prison-swap), and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/harris-biden-russia-evan-gershkovich-prisoner-swap-video-b2590009.html) show Joe Biden greeting freed Americans as they exited the plane in August 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that he boarded an empty plane afterward.

So, the overall veracity is: false
