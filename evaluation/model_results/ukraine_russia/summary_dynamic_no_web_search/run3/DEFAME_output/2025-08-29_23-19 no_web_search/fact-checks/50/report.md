### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images of Annalena Baerbock.

Additionally, there is a result from [ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-05/german-foreign-minister-annalena-baerbock-china-russia-trade/103802558) ![image 6886](media/2025-08-29_23-09-1756508954-932032.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Annalena Baerbock was active in February 2025 and that she commented on Donald Trump's remarks regarding Zelenskyy. One source states that Germany criticized Trump for calling Zelenskyy a dictator [Source](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/).

However, the evidence does not contain any information about Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties.

Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

However, none of the sources mention Annalena Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Annalena Baerbock was active in February 2025 and commented on Donald Trump's remarks regarding Zelenskyy. However, the search results do not contain any information about Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Annalena Baerbock was active in February 2025 and commented on Donald Trump's remarks regarding Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not contain any information about Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while Annalena Baerbock was active and commented on Donald Trump's remarks about Zelenskyy in February 2025, as evidenced by sources like [Source](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/), there is no evidence to support the claim that she threatened to sever ties with the US.
