Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Final Judgement

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine after a heated exchange with Donald Trump in February 2025 is not supported by the available evidence. While images confirm a meeting and a heated exchange between the two leaders, no source provides the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy.
