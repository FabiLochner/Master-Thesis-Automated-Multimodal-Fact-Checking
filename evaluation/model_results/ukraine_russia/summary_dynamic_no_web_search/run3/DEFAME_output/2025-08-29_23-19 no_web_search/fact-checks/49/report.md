## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and the BBC ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) mention the visit.

The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)) also covers the visit, suggesting it might have been a partisan political event. None of the sources mention Israeli bombs or Gaza. ![image 954](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504302-187821.jpg) ![image 960](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504308-548113.jpg) ![image 963](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504311-967303.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Associated Press, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and BBC News all published images of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells (![image 2213](media/2025-08-07_20-09-1754597376-342774.jpg), ![image 2214](media/2025-08-07_20-09-1754597377-142113.jpg), ![image 2215](media/2025-08-07_20-09-1754597377-540519.jpg)). The image in the claim shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells (![image 16](media/49.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania. The evidence does not mention Israeli bombs or their intended use against Palestinians in Gaza.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a US ammunition plant, not Israeli bombs. The claim misrepresents the context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania, as reported by the BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)). The claim that the image shows Zelenskyy signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is false, as the evidence does not support this assertion.
