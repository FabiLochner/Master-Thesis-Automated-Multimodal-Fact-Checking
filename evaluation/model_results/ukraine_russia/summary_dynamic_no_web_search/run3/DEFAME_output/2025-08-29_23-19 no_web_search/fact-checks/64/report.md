The provided links ([https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2025-02-24/trump-and-macron-meet-in-washington-as-europe-pleads-for-continued-help-with-ukraine](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2025-02-24/trump-and-macron-meet-in-washington-as-europe-pleads-for-continued-help-with-ukraine), [https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/pm/macron-corrects-trump-in-press-conference/104981718](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/pm/macron-corrects-trump-in-press-conference/104981718), and [https://abcnews.go.com/International/macron-warns-trump-careful-ukraine-fact-checks-white/story?id=119157061](https://abcnews.go.com/International/macron-warns-trump-careful-ukraine-fact-checks-white/story?id=119157061)) provide additional context. However, none of the provided evidence mentions whether Macron called Putin a "butcher" during the press conference.

To verify the claim, information about the content of the press conference is needed.
