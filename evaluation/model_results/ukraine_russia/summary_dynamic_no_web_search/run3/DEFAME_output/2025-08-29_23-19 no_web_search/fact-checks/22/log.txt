The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While the image's location is uncertain, it is likely not related to the Kursk offensive. The evidence does not support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The nature of the explosion is unknown.

So, the overall veracity is: false
