The claim 'In an interview with podcaster Theo Von in August 2024, Donald Trump criticized British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von, and Trump and Keir Starmer have discussed Ukraine-related topics, there is no evidence to confirm that Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
