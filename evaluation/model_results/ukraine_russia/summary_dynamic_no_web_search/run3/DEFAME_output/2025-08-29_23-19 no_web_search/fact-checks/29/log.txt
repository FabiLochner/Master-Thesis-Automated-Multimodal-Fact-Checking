The claim 'On Feb. 28, 2025, before a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Democrats.' is true.
Justification: The claim is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including the North Dakota Monitor ([Source](https://northdakotamonitor.com/2025/02/28/repub/trump-zelenskyy-clash-in-oval-office-blowup-over-peace-negotiations/)), PBS.org ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trump-and-vances-attacks-on-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy)), and NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/nx-s1-5505319/european-leaders-zelenskyy-trump)), show Zelenskyy meeting with Trump on February 28, 2025. Additionally, a tweet from Chris Murphy and an image of Zelenskyy with Chuck Schumer ([Source](<image:7148>), [Source](<image:7149>)) confirm a meeting with Democrats on the same day.

So, the overall veracity is: true
