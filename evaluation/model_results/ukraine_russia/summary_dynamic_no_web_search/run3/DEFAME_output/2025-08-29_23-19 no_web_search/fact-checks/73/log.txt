Content: Bloomberg reports that Ukraine lost an F-16 jet in a crash. <image:7346>

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts an F-16 that crashed in 2019 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure, as reported by The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)). This crash is unrelated to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
