The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check, based on multiple image searches, found numerous images of Mark Rutte and Donald Trump together, but no evidence to support the claim that Rutte made the specific statement about Trump, Ukraine, Putin, and the expulsion of the United States from NATO. Therefore, the claim is rated as false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
