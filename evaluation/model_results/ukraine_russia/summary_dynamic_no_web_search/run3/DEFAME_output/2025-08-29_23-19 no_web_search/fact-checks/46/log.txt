The claim 'During his visit to the White House in April 2025 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While images confirm Benjamin Netanyahu's presence at the White House, a source explicitly labels information about resettling Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria as "FAKE" ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/netanyahu-orders-israeli-army-to-keep-control-of-syrias-demilitarized-buffer-zone-until-end-of-2025/3427726](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/netanyahu-orders-israeli-army-to-keep-control-of-syrias-demilitarized-buffer-zone-until-end-of-2025/3427726)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
