## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in August 2024, during Joe Biden's presidency, there were discussions and reports about his administration's nuclear strategy, particularly concerning China. The New York Times and The Guardian published articles on this topic ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat)).

Tasnim News also reported on Biden approving a nuclear strategy focused on China ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/08/21/3145608/biden-approves-nuclear-strategy-focusing-on-china-report](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/08/21/3145608/biden-approves-nuclear-strategy-focusing-on-china-report)). However, the provided evidence does not explicitly mention Russia or North Korea in the context of preparing for nuclear confrontations.

However, the provided sources do not mention Russia or North Korea in the context of preparing for nuclear confrontations. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks information about the involvement of Russia and North Korea. `false`
