The AP News article ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy ![image 7191](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756509970-058174.jpg).

The Le Monde article ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2025/02/28/trump-and-zelensky-openly-clash-in-heated-white-house-exchange_6738686_133.html)) also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy ![image 7192](media/2025-08-29_23-26-1756509970-355572.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence includes two images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one from an AP News article ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) and another from a Le Monde article ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2025/02/28/trump-and-zelensky-openly-clash-in-heated-white-house-exchange_6738686_133.html)). However, neither article provides information about Zelenskyy's statement regarding U.S. aid or confirms the claim that the aid is a money laundering operation.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the veracity of the claim.

The search results included articles from AP News, CNN, and others ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russian-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-news-conference-5440b3d3034a34461d93d0740e0c1ae6), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/politics/republicans-trump-ukraine-aid)), but none contained the specific statement or supported the assertion.
