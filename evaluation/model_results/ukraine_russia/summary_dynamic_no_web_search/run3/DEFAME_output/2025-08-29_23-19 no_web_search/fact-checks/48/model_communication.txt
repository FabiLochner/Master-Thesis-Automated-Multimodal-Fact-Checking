# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reveals that corruption and arms trafficking are issues in Ukraine. Reports from The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Al Jazeera indicate corruption within the Ukrainian government, including the theft of funds intended for arms purchases. Additionally, the search results from `image_search` on "Ukraine arms trafficking investigation" show that arms trafficking is a concern.

While the evidence points to corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence suggests that some arms may be diverted through corruption or trafficking, but it does not provide specific figures on the scale of such sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence.

The New York Times reported on a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption (<image:6904>). Bloomberg reported that Ukrainian officials stole $40 million meant to buy arms (<image:6905>). Al Jazeera reported that Ukraine uncovered a corruption scheme in the defense sector (<image:6906>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to arms trafficking in Ukraine. One source from [globalinitiative.net](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/) discusses arms trafficking <image:6910>. The Financial Times published an image of Ukrainian soldiers with military equipment <image:6912>.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) published an article that includes an image of weapons in crates <image:6915>.


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals that corruption and arms trafficking are issues in Ukraine. Reports from The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Al Jazeera indicate corruption within the Ukrainian government, including the theft of funds intended for arms purchases. Additionally, the search results from `image_search` on "Ukraine arms trafficking investigation" show that arms trafficking is a concern.

While the evidence points to corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence suggests that some arms may be diverted through corruption or trafficking, but it does not provide specific figures on the scale of such sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence from Statista.com shows that Ukraine has exported arms to various countries, with China being the largest importer. However, the provided data does not specify the source of these arms (e.g., whether they were received from the US or other sources).

Therefore, the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States remains unverified. The evidence confirms that Ukraine exports arms, but it does not provide information about the origin of these arms or the proportion of US-supplied armaments being sold.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The search results provide additional context about Elon Musk and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they do not confirm the authenticity of the X post. The AOL article mentions fact-checking Elon Musk, which suggests that his posts are sometimes subject to scrutiny.

I still need to find the original X post to verify the Claim.

Rolling Stone, Axios, and Fox News have published articles about Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The articles include images of Musk and Trump together (<image:7295>, <image:7296>). Fox News also includes an image of Musk, Trump, and Zelenskyy (<image:7297>).

## Elaboration
The search results confirm that Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are public figures and have interacted with each other. However, the search results do not provide any information about the authenticity of the X post in the Claim.

I still need to find the original X post to verify the Claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are public figures and have interacted with each other. However, the search results do not provide any information about the authenticity of the X post in the Claim. The image in the claim shows a doctored dollar bill with Donald Trump's image on it, which suggests the post is not authentic.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are public figures who have interacted, the image in the claim depicts a doctored dollar bill, indicating the X post is not authentic.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a press conference between Macron and Trump took place on February 24, 2025. However, the provided sources ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5306974/trump-macron-white-house-russia-ukraine-war-nato](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5306974/trump-macron-white-house-russia-ukraine-war-nato), [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hosts-frances-macron-white-house-amid-ukraine/story?id=119123204](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hosts-frances-macron-white-house-amid-ukraine/story?id=119123204), and [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/trump-ukraine-putin-peacekeepers-macron](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/trump-ukraine-putin-peacekeepers-macron)) do not provide any information about Macron calling Putin a "butcher."

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

NBC News published satellite images of a Russian arms depot (<image:7357>). NV.ua shows a satellite image of a damaged Russian ammunition depot in Tver Oblast, dated 22/09/2024 (<image:7361>).


## Elaboration
The evidence now includes images of a Russian weapons depot and a damaged ammunition depot in Tver Oblast. The image from NV.ua (<image:7361>) shows a damaged depot, which could be the same location as in the original claim. However, the evidence still does not support the claim that the damage was caused by a NATO strike or a nuclear weapon.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:23> This image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after it was hit by a, possible nuclear, strike from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:23>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:23>

## Elaboration
The provided image shows a location before and after an event that caused significant damage, including fire and smoke. The claim suggests this is a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, hit by a possible nuclear strike from NATO.

The evidence does not provide any information about the location being a Russian ammunition depot, nor does it mention the involvement of NATO or a nuclear strike. The evidence only shows the image.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. Additional information is needed to verify the location, the cause of the damage, and the entities involved.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Newsweek article provides an image of a Russian ammunition depot before and after an event, which aligns with the format of the original claim's image. However, the evidence still does not confirm the cause of the damage or the involvement of NATO or a nuclear strike. The claim is therefore still unverified.
