Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-war-beijing-red-faced-as-kyiv-breaks-humanitarian-law-to-prove-china-wrong-8183057): 
Content: NDTV published an article about the Ukraine war, including an image of two men with their eyes blacked out. <image:6073>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the provided evidence. While image searches revealed articles discussing the war in Ukraine and China's relationship with Russia, including potential military aid, there is no direct evidence to confirm the deployment of Chinese Red Cross troops to the Russian-Ukrainian front. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
