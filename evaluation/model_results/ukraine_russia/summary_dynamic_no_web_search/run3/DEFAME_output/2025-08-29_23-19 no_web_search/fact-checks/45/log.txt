The claim 'American football player Colin Kaepernick said he will go to Russia if not properly respected in the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Colin Kaepernick said he would go to Russia if not properly respected in the United States is unverified. Multiple image searches, including those from The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Daily Mail, yielded results related to a Nike ad campaign featuring Kaepernick, but no evidence of the alleged statement about Russia was found.

So, the overall veracity is: false
