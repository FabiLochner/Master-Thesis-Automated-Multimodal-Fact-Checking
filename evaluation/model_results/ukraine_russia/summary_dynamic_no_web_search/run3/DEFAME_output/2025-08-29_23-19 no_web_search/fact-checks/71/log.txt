The claim 'In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.' is false.
Justification: The IMF did publish the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, but the search results do not support the claim that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world. The available data focuses on economic growth projections, not the overall ranking of economies.

So, the overall veracity is: false
