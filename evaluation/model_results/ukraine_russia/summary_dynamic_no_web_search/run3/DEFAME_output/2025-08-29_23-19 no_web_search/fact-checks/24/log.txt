The claim 'Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that the evidence consistently points to Howard Buffett's donations to Ukraine, not Warren Buffett. Multiple sources, including [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-philanthropist-buffett-warns-against-ukraine-fatigue-2023-09-20/), confirm Howard Buffett's involvement. There is no evidence to support the claim that Warren Buffett has donated more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.

So, the overall veracity is: false
