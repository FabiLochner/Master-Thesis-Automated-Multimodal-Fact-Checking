The claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The search results consistently show images of Mark Rutte and Donald Trump together, indicating they have interacted. However, the searches have not yielded any evidence to support the claim that Rutte made the specific statement about Trump, Ukraine, Putin, and the expulsion of the United States from NATO.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check, based on multiple image searches, found numerous images of Mark Rutte and Donald Trump together, but no evidence to support the claim that Rutte made the specific statement about Trump, Ukraine, Putin, and the expulsion of the United States from NATO. Therefore, the claim is rated as false.
