## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that the London summit on Ukraine took place on March 2, 2023, not 2025. The images from Le Monde, Al Jazeera, and ABC News show the leaders at the summit, and none of them depict the leaders taking off their suits.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. The image in the claim is not authentic.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is not authentic. The London summit on Ukraine took place in 2023, and the provided evidence does not show the leaders taking off their suits.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a London summit on Ukraine did occur on March 2, 2023, as reported by sources like [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/zelensky-joins-european-leaders-at-key-ukraine-summit-in-london_6738729_4.html), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/2/european-leaders-gather-in-london-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine), and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-set-european-summit-london-after-trump-showdown/story?id=119338966), the provided image does not align with the documented photographs of the event. The image in the claim is not authentic.
