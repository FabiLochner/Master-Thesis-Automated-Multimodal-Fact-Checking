The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024 cannot be verified. While evidence confirms Meloni's presence at the summit, no information was found regarding her statements on the matter.

So, the overall veracity is: false
