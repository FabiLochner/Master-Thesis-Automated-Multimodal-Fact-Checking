# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Actions
```
image_search("AP news interview Volodymyr Zelenskyy February 1 2025 aid")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The AP News article ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:7191>.

The Le Monde article ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2025/02/28/trump-and-zelensky-openly-clash-in-heated-white-house-exchange_6738686_133.html)) also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:7192>.


## Elaboration
The evidence includes two images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one from an AP News article ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) and another from a Le Monde article ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2025/02/28/trump-and-zelensky-openly-clash-in-heated-white-house-exchange_6738686_133.html)). However, neither article provides information about Zelenskyy's statement regarding U.S. aid or confirms the claim that the aid is a money laundering operation.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the veracity of the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles from AP News ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russian-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-news-conference-5440b3d3034a34461d93d0740e0c1ae6)), NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/g-s1-51205/up-first-newsletter-ukraine-us-mineral-deal-andrew-tate-aoc)), and PBS ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/zelenskyy-to-meet-trump-on-monday-after-u-s-russia-summit-secured-no-halt-to-war-in-ukraine)). Each article contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:7198>, <image:7199>, <image:7200>. However, none of the provided summaries mention Zelenskyy's statement about U.S. aid or the claim that it is a money laundering operation.


## Elaboration
The new evidence, which includes articles from AP News ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russian-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-news-conference-5440b3d3034a34461d93d0740e0c1ae6)), NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/g-s1-51205/up-first-newsletter-ukraine-us-mineral-deal-andrew-tate-aoc)), and PBS ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/zelenskyy-to-meet-trump-on-monday-after-u-s-russia-summit-secured-no-halt-to-war-in-ukraine)), does not support the claim. These articles feature images of Zelenskyy but do not contain any information about his statements regarding U.S. aid or the assertion that it is a money laundering operation.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of supporting evidence.

Each article contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:7206>, <image:7209>, <image:7211>. However, none of the provided summaries mention Zelenskyy's statement about U.S. aid or the claim that it is a money laundering operation.


## Elaboration
The latest search results, including articles from CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/politics/republicans-trump-ukraine-aid)), coloradonewsline.com, and SourceNM ([Source](https://sourcenm.com/2023/02/27/white-house-unveils-2b-in-weapons-for-ukraine-on-one-year-anniversary-of-russian-invasion/)), do not provide any information to support the claim. The articles feature images of Zelenskyy but do not contain any statements from him regarding U.S. aid being a money laundering operation.

The claim remains unsupported by the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results did not provide any evidence to support the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated in an AP news interview on February 1, 2025, that U.S. aid is a money laundering operation. The evidence consists of articles and images of Zelenskyy, but none of them contain the specific statement or support the claim.

The other source ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/netanyahu-orders-israeli-army-to-keep-control-of-syrias-demilitarized-buffer-zone-until-end-of-2025/3427726](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/netanyahu-orders-israeli-army-to-keep-control-of-syrias-demilitarized-buffer-zone-until-end-of-2025/3427726)) does not contain any relevant information.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images of Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, specifically with Donald Trump. However, the evidence also includes a "FAKE" image discussing the resettlement of Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria.

The evidence does not provide any information to support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit to the White House. The "FAKE" image suggests that this information is false.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. The search results also show that Donald Trump and Keir Starmer have interacted and discussed Ukraine-related topics. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without further information. Specifically, the content of the Theo Von interview needs to be examined to confirm if the criticism occurred.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article about Keir Starmer and Donald Trump discussing a Ukraine peace deal (<image:7265>). CNN published an article on February 27, 2025, about Donald Trump and Keir Starmer (<image:7266>). NBC News has an image of Donald Trump shaking hands with an individual, with flags of the United States and the United Kingdom in the background (<image:7267>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. The search results also show that Donald Trump and Keir Starmer have interacted and discussed Ukraine-related topics. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without further information. Specifically, the content of the Theo Von interview needs to be examined to confirm if the criticism occurred.

CNN published an article on February 27, 2025, about Donald Trump and Keir Starmer (<image:7266>). NBC News has an image of Donald Trump shaking hands with an individual, with flags of the United States and the United Kingdom in the background (<image:7267>).

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that in August 2024, during Joe Biden's presidency, there were discussions and reports about his administration's nuclear strategy, particularly concerning China. The New York Times and The Guardian published articles on this topic ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat)).

Tasnim News also reported on Biden approving a nuclear strategy focused on China ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/08/21/3145608/biden-approves-nuclear-strategy-focusing-on-china-report](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/08/21/3145608/biden-approves-nuclear-strategy-focusing-on-china-report)). However, the provided evidence does not explicitly mention Russia or North Korea in the context of preparing for nuclear confrontations.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported as it relates to China, but the evidence is missing information about Russia and North Korea.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in February 2022, the Business Insider news outlet reported on Thursday.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already [lost](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20241013/1068665538.html)
 nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report.

Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and [NATO](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20240512/1066501213.html)
 were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image depicts destroyed tanks. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine, including articles from The Moscow Times and Sputnik Africa. The image search also provides articles from Al Jazeera and NBC News that mention the Kursk region and show images of tanks. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of specific information about the image's context.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts destroyed tanks. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine, including articles from The Moscow Times and Sputnik Africa. The image search also provides articles from Al Jazeera and NBC News that mention the Kursk region and show images of tanks. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of specific information about the image's context.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of destroyed tanks (<image:26>) appears in multiple articles. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, discusses Ukraine's loss of Leopard tanks since February 2022, including images of Leopard 2 tanks (<image:2767>, <image:2768>) ([https://en.sputniknews.africa/20241017/ukraine-has-reportedly-lost-about-40-leopard-tanks-since-february-2022-1068726197.html](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20241017/ukraine-has-reportedly-lost-about-40-leopard-tanks-since-february-2022-1068726197.html)).

Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, reports on Russia capturing German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, also including the image of destroyed tanks (<image:2769>) ([https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/06/13/russia-says-german-leopard-tanks-us-bradleys-captured-in-ukraine-a81492](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/06/13/russia-says-german-leopard-tanks-us-bradleys-captured-in-ukraine-a81492)). Defence Security Asia published an article on May 19, 2024, discussing the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine, including an image of a captured Leopard 2A6 tank (<image:2776>) ([https://defencesecurityasia.com/en/german-made-leopard-tanks-bear-the-brunt-of-russian-forces-rejuvenation-in-ukraine/](https://defencesecurityasia.com/en/german-made-leopard-tanks-bear-the-brunt-of-russian-forces-rejuvenation-in-ukraine/)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, which includes an image of a Ukrainian tank. ([https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/](https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/)) <image:6630>

Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of eliminating a Ukrainian unit in Kursk, which includes an image of a tank. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk)) <image:6631> NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which includes an image of a tank. ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172)) <image:6632>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts destroyed tanks. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine, including articles from The Moscow Times and Sputnik Africa. The image search also provides articles from Al Jazeera and NBC News that mention the Kursk region and show images of tanks. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of specific information about the image's context.

## Elaboration
