The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The provided evidence does not support the assertion that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine detailing bribes taken by US politicians. While the search results include articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, and images of US politicians, there is no mention of the list or any evidence of the alleged bribes.

So, the overall veracity is: false
