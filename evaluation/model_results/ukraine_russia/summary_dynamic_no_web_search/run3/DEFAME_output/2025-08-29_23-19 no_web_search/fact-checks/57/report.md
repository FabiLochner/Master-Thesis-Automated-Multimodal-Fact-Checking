## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. The search results also show that Donald Trump and Keir Starmer have interacted and discussed Ukraine-related topics. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Trump criticized Starmer in the Theo Von interview regarding a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without further information. Specifically, the content of the Theo Von interview needs to be examined to confirm if the criticism occurred.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/donald-trump-cocaine-theo-von-interview-b2599493.html): 
Content: The Independent published an article about the interview between Donald Trump and Theo Von. ![image 7273](media/2025-08-29_23-28-1756510123-163063.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms the existence of the interview between Donald Trump and Theo Von. However, it still does not provide any information about the specific topics discussed, such as the 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine or any criticism of Keir Starmer.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of specific details about the interview's content.
